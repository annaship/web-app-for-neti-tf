Evolutionary relationships of cultivated barophilic bacteria were determined. All psychrophilic and barophilic isolates were afliated with one of ve genera of the gamma subdivision of the class Proteobacteria (-Proteobacteria): Shewanella, Photobacterium, Colwellia, Moritella, and a new group containing strain CNPT3. The data indicate that the barophilic phenotype has evolved independently in different -Proteobacteria genera. 
Barophilic bacteria grow optimally or exclusively at hydrostatic pressures greater than 1 atm (1 atm  0.1013 MPa  
1.103 bar). Barophilic isolates have been obtained from a variety of different deep-sea habitats by a number of different laboratories (5, 8, 9, 15, 16, 20, 34–36, 38, 39). 
The phylogenetic afliations of several barophilic isolates have been inferred by 5S rRNA (8, 22) or 16S-like rRNA sequence comparisons (9, 13, 15, 16, 20). Studies based on 5S rRNA sequences showed that two facultatively barophilic strains from a depth of 5,920 m were afliated with the genus Shewanella and that one obligate barophile from a depth of 7,410 m was specically related to a psychrophilic marine isolate, Colwellia psychroerythrus (9). Additionally, small-subunit rRNA sequence analysis indicated that two strains of Antarctic obligate barophiles, initially grown in mixed culture, are members of the gamma subdivision of the class Proteobacteria (-Proteobacteria) (20). Recently, Kato and coworkers also isolated many barophilic and barotolerant strains reported to belong to the -Proteobacteria (15, 16). In this study, we report the phylogenetic analyses and partial phenotypic characterization of a variety of psychrophilic and barophilic heterotrophic bacterial isolates. 
Bacterial strains and growth media. The pressure physiologies of most barophilic bacterial strains in this study have been previously described (Table 1) (7, 35, 37–39). Isolate SS9 originated from a depth of 2,551 m in the Sulu Sea and was obtained from an amphipod homogenate enrichment (5). Barophilic strain F1A was kindly provided by Carl O. Wirsen (34). All other reference strains were obtained from the culture collection of A. A. Yayanos or the American Type Culture Collection. Nonbarophilic strains were grown at 3°C in marine broth 2216 (Difco). Barophilic strains were grown at 3°C in marine broth 2216 at the appropriate hydrostatic pressure (Table 1), as previously described (Table 1) (6, 7, 39), decompressed, harvested by centrifugation, and stored frozen at 
80°C. 
All barophilic strains examined in this study (Table 1), with the exception of strain MT41, which was not tested, were successfully stored as frozen stock cultures at 1.1  105 Pa and 

80°C. 
Strains were grown at the appropriate growth pressure at 3°C to approximately 1  108 cells/ml, decompressed, immediately diluted 1:1 in ice-cold 2 freeze buffer (1% yeast extract, 10% glycerol, 10% dimethyl sulfoxide, 0.1 M K2HPO4

[pH 7.0]), quickly frozen in a dry ice-ethanol bath, and stored at 80°C. Frozen cultures were revived by inoculation of ice-cold marine broth with scrapings from the frozen stock and incubation under the appropriate hydrostatic pressure at 3°C. 
Phenotypic characterization. DNA base composition was determined from thermal melting proles performed under standard conditions as previously described (24). Other physiological tests were performed by slight modication of the general procedures described by Baumann and Baumann (1). All high-pressure physiological tests were performed in tandem with uninoculated blank controls. Acid production from glucose was assessed in a modied OF medium (1) containing 0.5 ASW (1 ASW is 400 mM NaCl, 100 mM MgSO4  7H2O, 20 mM KCl, 20 mM CaCl2  2H2O), 10 mM morpholinepropanesulfonic acid (MOPS; pH 7.5) at 22°C, 1% glucose, 0.2% agar, 0.5% yeast extract, and 0.003% bromcresol purple. Cultures were inoculated as stabs and sealed with molten media containing 4% gelatin. After topping the tube with 4% gelatin, the tubes were chilled to 4°C, sealed with Paralm, and incubated at the appropriate pressure at 3°C (Table 1). After decompression, the stabs were examined for growth and acid production. Hydrogen sulde production from thiosulfate was assessed in triple sugar iron agar stabs (TSI; Difco) prepared with 0.5 ASW instead of water. DNase activity was tested by inoculation of stab cultures in DNase medium (Difco) containing 0.5 ASW and 0.01% methyl green. Oxidase tests were performed as previously described (1). Tests for anaerobic growth with lactate as the sole carbon source and trimethylamine oxide (TMAO) as the sole electron acceptor were performed as follows. Two parts of a dened mineral medium (SM medium [10]) was mixed with 12% gelatin plus the following combinations of electron donors and acceptors: (i) no addition, (ii) 25 mM TMAO, (iii) 15 mM lactate, and (iv) 25 mM TMAO plus 15 mM lactate. The tube was chilled to solidify the gelatin, inoculated as a stab, overlaid with 1 ml of 4% gelatin, sealed with Paralm, and incubated at 2°C and the pressure appropriate for the specic strain. Strains which showed growth only in the presence of TMAO and lactate were scored as positive. Motility determinations were performed on cultures grown at their optimal growth pressure in marine broth. Exponentially growing cultures were decompressed to 1.1  105 Pa, placed on a chilled microscope slide, and immediately examined by phase microscopy for motility at 1.1  105 Pa. 
Phylogenetic characterization. Nucleic acids were puried by standard methods (30). In some cases (SC2A, F1A, Shewanella hanedai ATCC 33224, MT41, PT48, and PT99), rRNA templates

were directly sequenced with reverse transcriptase (Seikagaku) as previously described (17, 18). All other small subunit rRNA sequences (PE36, Moritella marinus MP1, CNPT3, SS9, S. hanedai ATCC 35256, S. benthica ATCC 43991, and Shewanella putrefaciens ATCC 8072) were obtained by direct sequencing of PCR-amplied ribosomal DNA genes. 
Phylogenetic analyses were conducted with reference sequences and software (GDE 2.2 [32]) obtained via anonymous le transfer program from the Ribosomal RNA Database Project (23) and the software package Phylip, version 3.5 (12). Distance matrices were calculated with the Phylip program DNAdist by using the Kimura two-parameter model, assuming a transition/transversion ratio of 2.0. Distance matrix trees were then inferred from the estimated evolutionary distances by neighbor-joining analyses. Bootstrap neighbor-joining analysis was conducted on 100 replicates with random taxon addition. Maximum likelihood phylogenetic analyses (11) were performed with fastDNAml, version 1.0 (26), employing empirical base frequency, global branch swapping, and bootstrapping options. 
Nucleotide sequence accession number. The sequences of the ribosomal DNA genes used in this study have been deposited in GenBank under accession no. U91586 to U91600. 
Results and discussion. Strain designations, sites and depths of origin, and pressure optima for barophilic strains characterized in this study are shown in Table 1. Phenotypic characteristics of barophilic isolates and reference strains are shown in Table 2. Physiological tests conducted at 3°C and in situ growth pressures (Tables 1 and 2) were consistent with the placement of F1A, PT99, PT48, and SC2A within the genus Shewanella. Characteristics common to Shewanella species (19) and found in S. benthica strains PT99, PT48, and F1A included H2S production on TSI agar, lactate oxidation coupled to TMAO reduction, being oxidase and DNase positive, and showing no fermentation of glucose. At 1.1  105 Pa and 8°C, S. benthica ATCC 43991 tested positive for anaerobic growth on lactate with Fe3 but not sulte as a terminal electron acceptor. Strain SC2A, phylogenetically afliated with S. putrefaciens, grew anaerobically on lactate with Fe3, TMAO, or sulte as the terminal electron acceptors. Unlike most other barophilic strains examined, strain CNPT3 fermented glucose vigorously as indicated by both acid production and gas production on glucose. Strain CNPT3 was the only strain examined which tested positive for arginine dihydrolase. 
Long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are found in a large percentage of barophilic isolates distributed among distinct genera (Table 2) (7, 34), although these fatty acids are not found exclusively in deep-sea barophilic strains (25, 26, 28, 40, 41). Psychrophilic or barophilic Photobacterium, Shewanella, Colwellia, and Moritella strains have all been reported to contain high amounts of the PUFA eicosapentaenoic acid (C20:5) or docosahexaenoic acid (C22:6) in their membrane lipids. Eicosapentaenoic acid is found in the genus Shewanella (strains SC2A, PT99, PT48, and F1A) (7, 34), as well as in Photobacterium sp. strain SS9 (32a). Docosahexaenoic acid is found in members of two distinct barophile-containing groups, Moritella (M. marinus and sp. strain PE36 [7]) and Colwellia (sp. strain MT41) (7). The incidence of high PUFA content in a variety of phylogenetically distinct psychrophilic and barophilic genera suggests an important role for PUFAs in maintenance of membrane uidity at low temperature and high pressure (7). 
Phylogenetic analysis of psychrophilic and barophilic deep-sea bacteria consistently placed them within one of ve groupings (Fig. 1). All deep-sea heterotrophic, barophilic bacteria examined were afliated with one of the following ve -Proteobacteria genera: Shewanella, Photobacterium, Colwellia, Moritella (former Vibrio sp.) (4), and one as-yet-undescribed group containing strain CNPT3 and one Antarctic barophile from the Weddell Sea (Fig. 1). Facultative barophiles were distributed among all ve of these barophile-containing phylogenetic groups (Fig. 1). Obligate barophiles fell within one of three clades: Shewanella, Colwellia, or the CNPT3 group (Fig. 1). 
rRNA sequence similarity values determined from 1,043 unambiguously aligned positions (Fig. 1) relating the barophilic strains examined in this study to previously sequenced strains were as follows: SS9 and Photobacterium phosphoreum, 96.2%; PE36 and M. marinus, 97.7%; CNPT3 and WHB46-2, 97.5%; MT41 and C. psychroerythrus, 92.6%; SC2A and S. putrefaciens 8071, 95.3%; PT48 and S. benthica 43992, 97.1%; PT99 and S. benthica 43991, 95.8%; and F1A and S. benthica ATCC 43991, 96.9%. Other barophilic and barotolerant strains recently isolated by the Japanese DEEPSTAR group (29, 30) were also closely afliated with the groups described above (Fig. 1) and include strains afliated with Moritella (DSK1), S. benthica (DSS12, DB9606, and DB6101), and Photobacterium (DSJ4) (Fig. 1). 
The genus Shewanella is composed of an ecologically diverse group of obligately respiratory, gram-negative Proteobacteria isolates of both marine and terrestrial origin (9, 13, 14, 21, 22, 27, 29, 31, 33, 37). A large number of barophilic isolates, obtained by ve different laboratories working in disparate locales (7, 8, 15, 16, 20, 34), are S. benthica strains or extremely close relatives (Fig. 1). The data indicate that S. benthica is the most commonly isolated barophilic species, recovered from a variety of abyssal to hadal environments in Pacic, Atlantic, and Antarctic seas. It is difcult to judge from available data how numerically abundant or ecologically signicant this species actually is, since its representation in deep-sea bacterial

culture collections may simply reect its selective enrichment in culture and not its numerical abundance. 
In total, our analyses indicate that the evolution of barophilic phenotype is not limited to one or a few genera, but may be fairly widely distributed among the -Proteobacteria and possibly other eubacterial or archaeal phyla. Considering that many naturally occurring microorganisms have proven difcult or impossible to recover by standard cultivation techniques, it is likely that many new lineages of deep-sea barophilic bacteria remain to be discovered and described.
