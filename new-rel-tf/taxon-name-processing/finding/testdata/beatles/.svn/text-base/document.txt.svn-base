ABSTRACT 

The external morphology of the adult, egg, larva, and pupa of Agathidium oniscoides Beauvois is described. The natural history of the genus is reviewed, including associations with Myxomycetes and fungi and techniques for eld collection and laboratory study. The phylogenetic species concept is discussed and applied in this study. A key and brief diagnoses are provided for the genera of Agathidiini (Coleoptera: Leiodidae: Leiodinae) of North and Central America. Volvoxis Kugelann is regarded as a nomen oblitum, and its junior synonym Agathidium Panzer is regarded as the valid name (nomen protectum) for this taxon by invoking article 23.9 of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature. A key to species groups of Agathidium Panzer is presented. Species are revised for the A. sexstriatum, A. brevisternum, and A. revolvens species groups, including keys, diagnoses, descriptions, and gures of important morphological features. Lectotypes are designated for A. bistriatum Horn and A. sexstriatum Horn. The following new species are described: A. angustoperculum, n.sp., A. dioperculum, n.sp., A. dubitanoides, n.sp., A. falcatoperculum, n.sp., and A. rhinocerellum, n.sp. 
INTRODUCTION 
The genus Agathidium Panzer (Coleoptera: Leiodidae: Leiodinae) includes minute to small beetles (1–6 mm) that are generally round, convex, shiny, usually concolorous, and frequently capable of contracting their body into a compact ball-like shape when disturbed. Most species for which biological data exist are associated with slime-molds (Myxomycetes or Mycetozoa), in either their mature (sporocarp) or immature (plasmodium) stages. Unlike related genera in Agathidiini, Agathidium has also been associated with a substantial number of fungi, primarily Basidiomycetes. The full extent of the geographic range of the genus is not yet known, although most species inhabit temperate or montane tropical forests of the Northern Hemisphere. 
When the body is contracted, the antennae are retracted into ventral cephalic antennal grooves, the legs are folded beneath the body, and the broad lateral extensions of the pronotum fold over the sides of the elytra to achieve, in its ultimate expression, a nearly completely spherical form. Such contractility is seen only rarely among phylogenetically unrelated Coleoptera, including Clambidae, Nitidulidae (Cybocephalinae), and Scarabaeidae (Cryptocephalinae). Within the Leiodidae, this kind of defense is approached only by the single North American species of Aglyptinus Cockerell, Agl. laevis LeConte, but not by its numerous tropical congeners. In the case of Agl. laevis, however, the body is extremely convex and hemispherical but not contractile, whereas other (mostly tropical) species of the genus are far less convex. Interestingly, Agl. laevis has been found in association with slime-mold plasmodia (Stephenson et al., 1994), whereas Neotropical relatives of that species appear to be feeders on agarics (Wheeler, 1979a). The contractility of various species of Agathidium no doubt contributed to one common name for the Leiodidae, the ‘‘round fungus-beetles’’ (e.g., Arnett, 1971). 
The genus Agathidium is the largest possibly monophyletic group of insects documented to be principally slime-mold feeding. Such myxomycophagous habits are so widespread within the genus and related genera of Agathidiini ( Anisotomini) that it is reasonable to infer such associations with Myxomycetes were present in the common ancestor of both the genus and the tribe (Newton, 1984; Wheeler, 1984a, 1984b). Myxomycophagy has also been documented in Aglyptinus (see above) and in the southern temperate tribe Neopelatopini in the Leiodidae, and occurs outside leiodids sporadically across the Coleoptera. Putative slime-mold associates include certain Rhysodidae, Clambidae, Eucinetidae, Scaphidiinae (Staphylinidae), Cerylonidae, Latridiidae ( Lathridiidae), and Sphindidae (Blackwell, 1984; Lawrence and Newton, 1980; McHugh, 1993; Russell, 1979; Stephenson et al., 1994; Wheeler, 1979b, 1984a, 1984b, 1987). 
Agathidium is remarkably diverse in both morphological structure and ecological habits. Species vary dramatically in size (ranging from barely 1 mm to more than 6 mm when fully extended), body shape (from con

vex and noncontractile to elongate-oval and partially contractile, to broadly rounded, highly convex, and fully contractile), presence/absence of certain male sexual dimorphisms (i.e., enlarged basal tarsomeres on front and middle legs, a setose fovea on the metasternum, a tooth near the posteroapical angle of the metafemur, and a tusk on the left mandible), coloration (from reddish-brown to black and, rarely, with striking color patterns), and punctation (from nearly impunctate to confused punctation to serial punctation of elytra). Ecologically, Agathidium is one of few myxomycophagous taxa with species that have been found associated with both spores of mature fruiting bodies and the plasmodial stage of the hosts (Wheeler, 1984a, 1984b, 1987). Although rm host associations have not been made for a complex of anophthalmic and microphthalmic and ightless species in the Appalachian Mountains of the eastern United States, phylogenetic afnity, modications of the mouthparts, and eld observations are consistent with plasmodial predation in these species (Wheeler, 1984a). 
Palearctic species number about 200 and are comparatively well known (Angelini, 1995), whereas those of other regions continue to be described in large numbers. About 350 species have been described from the Oriental region where large numbers of ightless endemic forms are known. As an example, 50 out of 52 species of Agathidium known from Taiwan are endemic to that island (Angelini and de Marzo, 1995). Whereas substantial progress has been made on the faunas of these regions, that of the New World has remained largely unstudied (Angelini, 1988, 1990; Angelini and de Marzo, 1983, 1984, 1987a, 1987b, 1988, 1990, 1995). 
When Fall (1934: 99) revised the North American species, he stated that ‘‘A recent critical survey of the Agathidium material in my collection has revealed the presence of a considerable number of undescribed species. There is nothing surprising in this fact when it is recalled that the last published treatment of the genus was that of Dr. Horn in his Silphidae paper of more than fty years ago.’’ In fact, between the works of Horn and Fall, only four new species had been described (Brown, 1928, 1930, 1933; Fall, 1901). Today, more than 50 years have passed since Fall’s work, and a similar situation exists. Little taxonomic work has been done since Fall’s revision (Arnett, 1971; Hatch, 1957), and a considerable number of undescribed species have accumulated in collections. The current expansion in numbers of species is the result of three factors: (1) discovery of a large complex of ightless species in the Appalachian Mountains; (2) species of Mexico and Central America have nearly been ignored to date; and (3) characters of the aedeagus, which are extremely valuable diagnostic features at the species level, have not been previously examined. Only four species have been described from Latin America (Hendrichs, 1979; Matthews, 1887) despite evidence from collections that suggests the genus is very diverse in montane regions in this area. 
Our interest in the genus was a natural continuation of the senior author’s previous work on the related genus Anisotoma Panzer (Wheeler, 1979b), and it was intensied during studies of material at the American Museum of Natural History in 1974 when he rst observed an undescribed microphthalmic and ightless species endemic to the southern Appalachian Mountains of the United States. A subsequent eld trip in the spring of 1975 resulted in rediscovery of this and a related microphthalmic species. These species appear to be specialized predators of plasmodia, living in the rich, deep, moist leaf litter of high elevation forests with signicant levels of precipitation (Wheeler, 1984a, 1984b). Such aptery and microphthalmy is highly unusual among fungivores in general and slime-mold beetles in particular. Interestingly, ightless species of Dasycerus Brongniart (Staphylinidae) also exist in this region and feed upon a range of fungus hosts (Wheeler, 1984c; Wheeler and McHugh, 1994). 
Whereas this taxonomic study will increase our knowledge of the species diversity of the Agathidium of North and Central America, it is no more than the next logical step in the scientic exploration of this fascinating clade. Knowledge of the species diversity of Agathidium is far from complete. Additional species remain to be discovered in the United States, particularly in the Appalachian and Ozark regions and in the coastal forests of northern California, Washington, and Oregon. Further, based on the relative paucity of specimens examined from Latin America and the proportion of undescribed species among them, it is clear that no more than a small percentage of those species that live in montane, temperate forests of Mexico and Central America have been collected. It can be hoped only that this work will facilitate identication of known species and encourage the collection of those not yet known, so that another revision may be done in the future to more completely document the diversity of this remarkable genus. 

INTRODUCTION TO SERIES 
This is the rst of two publications that will collectively constitute a taxonomic revision of the species of Agathidium of North and Central America. This part provides an introduction to the genus Agathidium, a detailed account of the external morphology of a representative highly contractile species (A. oniscoides), a key to species groups, and revisions of the A. brevisternum, A. revolvens, and A. sexstriatum species groups. The subsequent part will include taxonomic treatments of the remaining species groups. 
All species in this study will be interpreted within the phylogenetic species concept as discussed by Nixon and Wheeler (1990, 1992), Wheeler and Nixon (1990), Wheeler and Platnick (2000a, 2000b), and Platnick and Wheeler (2000) as modied from Eldredge and Cracraft (1980), Nelson and Plat-nick (1981), and Cracraft (1983) (see also Cracraft, 1992). This concept, discussed below, can be anticipated to increase the number of species where the biological species concept has been subjectively applied and used to recognize as subspecies those populations that are holomorphologically distinct and more or less allopatric (Nelson and Plat-nick, 1981). In the case of Agathidium, however, species have historically been based on a morphological concept and closely approximate phylogenetic species. 
This monograph will serve as a stepping-stone toward a complete accounting of the species of the genus for the New World. As eld studies in areas of the U.S., Mexico, and Central and northern South America increase, many additional species of Agathidium await discovery and description. Just as recent work by Angelini (see references) has greatly increased our knowledge and estimates of the species diversity of the genus in Europe and Asia, this study will suggest that the diversity of American Agathidium has been seriously underestimated in the past. 
METHODS AND CONCEPTS 
PHYLOGENETIC SPECIES CONCEPT: The biological species concept (BSC) has dominated the zoological literature for half a century (Mayr, 1942, 1963, 1982). Despite considerable controversy over modes of speciation based on insect models, the BSC has remained nearly unquestioned in the literature on insects. Never fully embraced by botanists, the BSC has recently been widely criticized on general conceptual grounds (Cracraft, 1983; Cronquist, 1978; de Queiroz and Donoghue, 1988; Donoghue, 1985; Mishler and Donoghue, 1982; van Valen, 1976). In particular, the emergence of rigorous phylogenetic theories has indicated the need for a species concept more in line with the goals of phylogenetic analyses and classications (Wheeler and Meier, 2000). One consequence of the adoption of phylogenetic theory is the need to recognize elements analyzable by cladistic methods and not ones that are themselves divisible into smaller units with this property (Nixon and Wheeler, 1990). Stated another way, we need to identify the smallest units for which unequivocal historical evidence of phylogeny may be retrieved. Thus, since the appearance of Hennig’s phylogenetic theory, cladists have sought with increasing intensity a ‘‘phylogenetic’’ concept of species. 
Hennig (1966) modied the BSC to correct for ambiguity associated with time of speciation. The result, an ‘‘inter-nodal’’ concept, represented an advance (Ridley, 1989) but fell short of a clearly phylogenetic concept. Rosen (1978) introduced an autapomorphic concept describing species as minimum autapomorphic units (see also de Queiroz and Donoghue, 1988; Hill and Crane, 1982). Autapomorphic species, however, are based on the inappropriate use of phylogenetic analyses and application of concepts of monophyly and synapomorphy below the level of species. Such attempts to analyze demonstrably tokogenetic relationships through cladistic analyses are misguided at best (Wheeler and Nixon, 1990). 

This study uses the phylogenetic species concept (PSC), introduced by Eldredge and Cracraft (1980) and Nelson and Platnick (1981), and more recently discussed by Cracraft (1983, 1992) and amplied and extended by Nixon and Wheeler (1990, 1992) and Wheeler and Platnick (2000b). Stated simply, phylogenetic species are ‘‘the smallest aggregation of populations (sexual) or lineages (asexual) diagnosable by a unique combination of character states in comparable individuals (semaphoronts)’’ (Nixon and Wheeler, 1990). The PSC is consistent with phylogenetic theory, but independent of phylogenetic analysis. This is necessary since one goal of the PSC is to identify the elements for cladistic studies. 
Hennig (1966) distinguished between tokogenetic and phylogenetic relationships. Tokogenetic or birth relationships are shared by individuals within sexually reproducing populations and result in more or less reticulate patterns of relationship. Phylogenetic relationships are shared among species, involve character transformation, and are hierarchic in pattern. In evolutionary history, hierarchic relationships exist because characters of an ancestral species are inherited by its descendants, either in their original or some modied form (Platnick, 1979). Application of cladistic analysis to populations may result in a ‘‘cladogram’’. However, where evidence or inference of tokogenetic relationships exists, such a diagram may be artifactual rather than phylogenetic. The assumption that the outcome of such an analysis may be interpreted as a hierarchy is not valid. Thus, a species concept is desired that can distinguish among species prior to the cladistic analysis. 
Nixon and Wheeler (1990, 1992) drew a strict contrast between the terms character and trait. Traits are heritable attributes that vary within terms of a cladogram whereas characters are heritable attributes that are constant (xed) throughout each term. In the case of sexually reproducing animals, traits vary among individuals within a population whereas characters are constant among all individuals of one or more populations. However, constancy does not equate to invariability. A subapical tooth is frequently present on the metafemur of male Agathidium, yet the structure of that tooth varies from small straight structures to large curved ones. 
As Cracraft (1983) stated, another goal of a species concept is to recognize the end products of evolution. Because evolutionary history results from unpredictable interactions among many biotic and abiotic forces, references to ‘‘the’’ evolutionary process are illusory. Given the existence of many evolutionary processes, the advantages of recognizing historical patterns independent of any one of them become apparent. Regardless of the mode of speciation (e.g., allopatric, parapatric, sympatric, allochronic), the distribution of characters provides a mechanism for recognizing their end products. Thus, the PSC serves also as a unit species concept, making comparisons of numbers of species in different groups, and resulting from different speciation processes, meaningful. Because clonal systems result in new species with each mutation, numbers of species in asexual groups have been grossly underestimated by the BSC. It is logical, however, that such a system would result in greater numbers of end products than would sexual systems. 
The PSC has numerous advantages. Most importantly, it is based on observable characters so that the PSC is imminently testable and it provides logical elements among which cladistic relationships may be analyzed. For those who are compelled to build some ontological construct for species, the PSC provides a logical interface between the reticulate patterns of descent observed among individuals within populations of sexually reproductive organisms and the unique sequence of patterns of common ancestry shared among species belonging to a clade. The PSC gives to us both the maximum tokogenetic construct and the minimum phylogenetic element. For us, the epistemological linkage of the PSC to characters is not a philosophical weakness, but a strength. Its denition makes clear its connection in practice to empirical data. Just as for cladistic analysis, the only ontological concern that must be addressed is the assumption that phylogenetic species share a common history (i.e., that evolution has occurred). 

DISARTICULATION AND DISSECTION TECHNIQUES: Conrmation of species identity for many Agathidium beetles requires examination of the male aedeagus. Males can usually be sorted from females by one or more of the following dimorphisms: (1) enlargement of pro-and mesobasotarsomeres and/or presence of spatulate ventral setae on basotarsomeres; (2) presence of an apical or preapical tusk or horn on the dorsum of the left mandible; (3) presence of a metasternal fovea, varying from single or paired punctiform structures to much larger transverse oval eroded areas bearing more or less long and frequently dense setae; or (4) presence of a preapical or apical tooth on the posterior margin of the metafemur. Examination of the protarsus is usually sufcient. In their extreme form, the basal segments are distinctly expanded with large, dense patches of spatulate setae beneath. In their least developed form, however, the tarsi are only indistinctly laterally expanded. Even in these individuals, however, a small number of ventral, spatulate setae are visible at moderate magnications. 
Once identied, male specimens were relaxed by heating them in water with a mild detergent. Once thoroughly relaxed, the elytra were teased apart, exposing the membranous tergum of the abdomen. The tergum was then incised by a minuten nadeln, and the aedeagus was removed from the abdomen by the points of minute forceps, a hooked insect pin, or minuten nadeln. The elytra were then replaced over the incision and the specimen was dried and remounted. Meanwhile, the aedeagus was heated gently in a 10% potassium hydroxide solution to macerate adhering muscle tissues. It was then rinsed completely in distilled water and placed in glycerin or a 50:50 % mixture of glycerin:glycerin jelly. Structures were then placed in a depression slide and examined with a Leitz Dialux 20 or 22 compound microscope with Nomarski differential interference contrast illumination. 
Female specimens, when dissected for study of ovipositor and spermatheca, were treated similarly except for the following. The entire abdomen was removed from the relaxed specimen and heated in 10% KOH. While rinsing in H2O, the apical two segments of the abdomen were pulled from the basal segments. This effectively removes both the ovipositor and spermatheca. After additional clearing, these structures were gently removed from the terminal segments and studied under cover glass. 
For detailed comparative morphological work, entire specimens were often disarticulated. In such cases, the entire specimen was placed in KOH and the major somatic segments were teased apart. Components of the mouthparts, antennae, and legs were removed and examined. The sclerites of such preparations, thoroughly rinsed in water, were stored in glycerin in microcups cut from glass vials and stored in ‘‘Watrous trays’’ (Wheeler and McHugh, 1987). 
OBSERVATION OF SPECIMENS: The convex shape and subtle differences in dorsal punctation of many Agathidium make their study and illustration difcult. Certain conventions were adopted for this study that standardize both our observations and the presentation of certain characters in scientic illustrations. Mention of these conventions will facilitate effective use of this publication and comparison of species. 
An outline drawing showing the dorsal body shape is presented for each species. The foreshortening of the curvature of the body combined with the degree of contraction of the body in its state of preservation make simultaneous observation of both the head and the elytra nearly impossible for many species. Thus, the dorsal drawings are actually composites. For the head, the specimen was tilted backward until the base of the labrum was just visible. For the elytra, the specimen was tilted forward until the apex of the lateral bead was just visible. By so doing, the shape of the cranium and elytra are both communicated in a single drawing, although in practice orientation of the specimen will have to be changed to examine these structures. 
The appearance of the punctation is inuenced to a considerable extent by the quality of lighting. Our observations and drawings were done using a very bright ber optic light source. A Mylar lm shield was used to diffuse the light. Under such light, it is far easier to discern serial rows of punctures that nearly blend in with the intervening, randomly distributed punctures under less diffuse light. We strongly recommend viewing punctation under such conditions when the presence or absence of subtle punctation difference is in question. 

To achieve such diffuse lighting, two approaches were used. For illustrations, where maximum diffusion was important and where specimens did not have to be moved once set into position for drawing, a tube was fashioned from Mylar and set around the specimen. Light was then shown through these curved walls. For routine observation and description, when the specimen had to be manipulated by hand constantly, and when less diffuse light was sufcient to observe punctation patterns, a piece of Mylar was bent into a loosely bowed shape and attached to the tips of the arms of the ber optic illuminator. This results in sufcient diffusion, with no interference in specimen manipulation. 
NATURAL HISTORY 

Beetles of the genus Agathidium are hypothesized to be predominantly and ancestrally associated with plasmodial slime-molds, the Myxomycetes or Mycetozoa. Plasmodial or true slime-molds include about 500 described species, most of which are more or less cosmopolitan in distribution (Martin and Alexopoulos, 1969). Large numbers of mature spores are liberated by wind, water, and arthropods into the air and environment where, given appropriate conditions, they germinate, releasing microscopic agellated amoeboid cells. These myxamoebae later coalesce to form the large, multinucleated plasmodium typical of Myxomycetes. The Myxomycetes move about under bark, between lamellae of decaying wood or decomposing leaves, or within matrices of rotting vegetative matter like giant amoebae, sometimes attaining a diameter of several feet (e.g., Wheeler, 1987). The comparison with amoebae may be more than analogous since one current view is that Myxomycetes are more closely related to certain Protista than they are to true fungi. Given cues that can vary among myxomycete clades and species, the plasmodium wells upward, forming mature sporocarps over a period of a few to 24 or more hours. 
Agathidium are, in general, found in moist forests. On a broad geographic scale, Agathidium are found in temperate forests of northern latitudes and southern montane regions. The genus is diverse in most forested areas of the northern hemisphere. On a local, habitat level, Agathidium are most easily found in dense forests where logs and litter are damp at the ground level. Whereas some other slime-mold beetles (e.g., Latridiidae, Sphindidae) frequent dry microhabitats also, such as in exposed elds, Agathidium seems less tolerant of low humidity situations. North American Agathidium are found from sea level to nearly 9000 feet elevation, in the case of A. estriatum in the Pinaleno Mountains of Arizona. 
Like other myxomycophagous Coleoptera, most documented host associations for Agathidium are with mature sporocarps. Unlike most other slime-mold beetles, relationships with plasmodia have been documented in species of apparently distantly related groups of the genus (cf. Newton, 1984; Stephenson et al., 1994; Wheeler, 1984a, 1984c, 1987). Plasmodial and sporocarpic associations have been noted also in the sister genus Anisotoma (Russell, 1979; Wheeler, 1980), although plasmodial feeding is less frequently observed and, considering the well-developed mandibular mola structure, may be facultative. In contrast, at least those highly contractile species related to the common North American species A. oniscoides may be obligate associates of plasmodia (Newton, 1984; Wheeler, 1984a, 1984c). The only hints of similarly obligate plasmodial relations elsewhere are for certain cerylonids, eucinetids, and possibly rhysodids (Stephenson et al., 1994; Vit, 1977). Generalizations are problematic, however, because of the extremely secretive habits of plasmodia under natural conditions. Plasmodia of many species remain hidden throughout their sometimes ephemeral existence, emerging only hours before fruition. Because plasmodia occur among wet decaying leaves, within piles of decomposing vegetation, between lamel

lae of rotting logs, and under loose-tting bark on trunks of dead trees, they are seldom observed by collectors of beetles. Further, once disturbed, actual feeding is rarely observed. Agathidium have been reared on plasmodia in the laboratory (Wheeler, 1987), but eld studies lag far behind circumstantial evidence for widespread, specialized plasmodial predation. It has been elsewhere (Wheeler, 1984a, 1984c) speculated that ightless species of Agathidium in the southern Appalachians of the United States are such plasmodial feeders based on their phylogenetic relationships and modications of the mandibular mola that suggest a change from ancestral spore-crushing (see also Lawrence, 1977; Lawrence, 1989). The senior author most recently collected such species in the summer of 1994 from wet rhododendron leaf litter. Only once was he able to directly observe one of these ightless beetles sitting upon a plasmodium. However, such dense, wet layers of leaves are difcult microhabitats to investigate. 
Slime-mold hosts utilized by Agathidium are numerous and phylogenetically diverse, encompassing most higher taxa of Myxomycetes. These hosts include nearly the full range of sizes, shapes, life stages, and sporocarp forms documented among slime-molds (gs. 1, 2), including stalked and sessile sporangia, cushionlike aethalia, densely packed pseudoaethalia, and plasmodia. 
The possibility of spore dispersal by Agathidium and other slime-mold beetles remains poorly investigated. Simple, external, mechanical spore dispersal has been experimentally demonstrated (see Blackwell, 1984). Because some slime-mold spores are known to show increased germination rates given a pH shock, ingestion by beetles might result in the survival of fewer spores, among which are at least some with enhanced germination potential. Regardless of active beetle dispersal success, the simple act of eating a sporocarp has the effect of disrupting the peridium and releasing large numbers of spores into the immediate environment and into the air as well. Considering the cosmopolitan distribution of many species of Myxomycetes (Martin and Alexopoulos, 1969), it is evident that most disperse quite well unassisted.

From these data and those for Anisotoma (Blackwell, 1984; Lawrence and Newton, 1980; Russell, 1979; Wheeler, 1979b, 1984a, 1984c) it is reasonable to conclude with Newton (1984) that whereas Anisotoma species appear to be obligate slime-mold feeders, evidence for Agathidium is less conclusive. Of 27 species reported from Myxomycetes, about 56% are reported also from Basidiomycetes. And of 21 species noted from Basidiomycetes, 38% are known also from Myxomycetes. Thirty-two species are reported from Myxomycetes, 23 from Basidiomycetes, and 14 are noted from both. Eighteen species of Agathidium are recorded from Myxomycetes exclusively, whereas nine species are recorded only from Basidiomycetes. 

Some species have been reported so many times from diverse Basidiomycetes that an association with these higher fungi is strongly suggested. This is reinforced by reports of spores of Polyporus squamosus in the gut of Agathidium seminulum (Hlisnikovsky´, 1964). Further, whereas species of diverse species groups (including three subgenera as generally recognized: Agathidium s.s., Cyphoceble, and Neoceble) have been associated with Myxomycetes, species of these same groups have been repeatedly associated with Basidiomycetes also. For at least some of these species, however, there may be an alternative explanation. 
Agathidium aristerium was observed feeding on plasmodia of the myxomycete Physarum polycephalum growing on the surface of oyster shell fungi (Pleurotus ostreatus: Tricholomataceae) on a beech tree in New York state (Wheeler, 1987). This epimycetic growth of Physarum polycephalum on Pleurotus is a phenomenon known well to mycologists, and the plasmodia of this and other slime-molds grow upon the surfaces of declining sporocarps of higher fungi. For at least some basidiomycete host reports for Agathidium it seems possible that plasmodia could have been present but undetected by collectors. In the future, special care should be taken to examine host Basidiomycetes carefully to ascertain if and when this may be the case. 
The occurrence of apparently both slime-mold and higher fungus feeding in Agathidium, combined with the occurrence of slime-mold feeding only in the related genus Anisotoma, reinforces the hypothesis that slime-mold associations may have been ancestral for the two clades combined and, by extension, for Agathidiini as a whole (Newton, 1984; Wheeler, 1984a, 1984c). 
COLLECTING AGATHIDIUM 
Specimens of Agathidium species may be collected either by hand directly from host slime-molds or indirectly by means of certain mechanical contrivances or traps. The most difcult part about searching for Agathidium on Myxomycetes is developing an eye (i.e., 
search image) for the hosts. Sporocarps of Myxomycetes are so diverse in size, shape, and color that learning to recognize all or most of them as slime-molds is in itself an accomplishment (gs. 1, 2). Fruiting bodies vary from minute, stalked forms less than 1 mm in height to enormous cushionlike fruitions of Fuligo or dense patches of hairlike Stemonitis that may be more than a foot in diameter. Similarly, plasmodia vary from microscopic, transparent, amoeboid forms to the world’s largest polynucleated cells. Agathidium aristerium, for example, was rst discovered breeding on a plasmodium of Physarum that was estimated to be larger than 4 feet in diameter! Some slime-molds are easily recognized, even in the plasmodial stage. Most are positively identied only with more careful, microscopic study (Martin and Alexopoulos, 1969). 
Once located, slime-molds may be removed with a piece of their substrate for closer examination. It is useful to hold a white sheet or a white box under the fruiting body while it is cut away from its substrate with a sharp knife blade. Sporocarps may be returned to the laboratory, where they can be spread upon a light-colored background under the heat of a desk lamp for sorting. Beetles covered by host spores are amazingly difcult to see. However, once heated, beetles will become active and easily spotted and sorted from the mass of host spores. Vouchers of sporocarps may be kept by gluing them to the inner surface of the lid of a fungus specimen box and drying them completely. 
Because plasmodia are easily damaged or desiccated, it is sometimes easier to simply examine them closely in the eld. Both adult and larval beetles may be seen upon plasmodia since they lack the cover of spores afforded by mature hosts. Some plasmodia, particularly certain pigmented ones (such as the common yellow Physarum and Fuligo species), can be induced to mature by exposing them to intense light as, for example, setting them in a Petri dish in direct sunlight on a window sill. They can be collected and kept in the laboratory on either agar plates or damp lter paper onto which are placed one or two akes of old-fashioned oatmeal. Upon fruition, such forms may be positively identied. Mycologists sometimes have clues to plasmodial identication that can be very helpful to the entomologist. Mustard yellow plasmodia that stain brick red upon ‘‘bruising’’ (that is, touching them with one’s nger) are usually members of the genus Fuligo, though we do not know that similar bruising does not exist in other genera. Some plasmodia, including Fuligo, have a characteristic odor that can be quite strong when the plasmodium is expansive. Occasionally a plasmodium can be smelled before locating it visually. It has a sweet, earthy smell. Nonpigmented plasmodia are more difcult to see, such as the gray, jellylike Stemonitis plasmodium that can be quite substantial in size. 

Flighted species may be collected using large-area ight-intercept traps of the kind described by Peck and Davies (1980). Both ighted and ightless species may be collected by sifting leaf litter, decaying wood, and similar substrates likely to include slime-molds and placing the siftate in a tullgren or Berlese funnel. This is particularly effective for collecting ightless species that are common in the Appalachians and Ozarks. In fact, during wet times of the spring and fall months in the Appalachians, sifting samples of mixed rhododendron-hardwood litter along mountain streams predictably yields one or more such species. In such circumstances leiodids often are exceeded in number of individuals only by carabids. 
MORPHOLOGY 

A detailed account of the morphology of Agathidium oniscoides is presented below. This is done to indicate through accurate illustrations the structures referred to in formal descriptions, and to establish a basis for comparative morphological studies within and outside of Agathidium. Agathidium oniscoides was selected as a representative species for biological and practical reasons. It is one of the most common and abundant species of northeastern North America, making many specimens available for study. Its comparatively large size made illustration of certain structures easier. Because its eggs, larvae, and pupae are known, adult structures may be seen in ontogenic context. Knowledge of slime-mold associations of A. oniscoides makes conjectures about the functional signicance of its morphology possible. For theoretical reasons, one might prefer a species less removed from the ground plan for the genus Agathidium. For example, differences between species of the A. sexstriatum species group and related taxa, notably Anisotoma species, are few and as such one of these species might have made a good choice. However, the morphology of Anisotoma has already been discussed elsewhere (Wheeler, 1979b), and A. oniscoides is more typical of the highly contractile forms generally thought of as representative Agathidium. 
The morphology of adult and pupal stages of A. oniscoides is given below. The eggs that have been seen in the course of female dissections have been oval, shiny, whitish colored, without striking structural details at low magnications, and notable only in their large size relative to the abdominal cavity. Agathidium larvae are active, eruciform, and setose and are rather broad and dorsoventrally compressed in shape (Wheeler, 1990a). There are three postembryonic larval instars that are rich in external characters, particularly with regard to chaetotaxy. The comparative morphology and ontogeny of larval semaphoronts of three North American species of Agathidium were described elsewhere in detail (Wheeler, 1990a), including all postembryonic instars of A. oniscoides. These data were used in a critical evaluation of Nelson’s (1978) biogenetic rule published separately (Wheeler, 1990b). Additional descriptions of larvae are given by Kilian (1998).

BODY FORM (gs. 3–5): Very broadly round, combined elytra about as wide as long; very convex, hemispherical; pronotum laterally expanded; sterna, particularly prosternum and metasternum, short; capable of contracting body into compact, ball shape concealing venter and appendages; length about 4.0–6.0 mm, extended; moderately heavily sclerotized; dorsum smooth, shiny, with at most microscopic setose punctures, but under low to moderate magnication 


Figs. 3–5. Agathidium oniscoides Palisot de Beauvois, habitus: 3, dorsal; 4, ventral; 5, lateral. 
(e.g., 10–25) nearly devoid of punctation or setation; color at maturity dark reddish-brown to black. 
MORPHOMETRICS (gs. 6–8): If few specimens were available, then all of them were measured. If more material was available, then four or ve of the smallest and largest individuals were measured to give an indication of the size range for the species. Measurements were made on a Wild M3C dissecting microscope at 64 magnication using a Lasico digital micrometer. Morphometrics referred to in this study include the following primary measures, some of which are presented in the text in the form of rel
ative ratios:  
OHW  Ocular head width—measured at  
midpoint of longitudinal axis of  
eye.  
PHW  Postocular head width—mea 
sured at posterior margin of eye.  
MDL  Median head length—measured  
from base of labrum to posterior  
margin of cranium.  
PNW  Pronotal width—measured at  
midpoint of longitudinal axis,  
measured in practice in ventral  
view to avoid problems of cur 
vature in dorsal orientation.  
PNH  Pronotal height—distance along  
imaginary axis from midpoints of  
dorsum and lateral margin, mea 
sured in lateral view.  
PNL  Pronotal length—measured along  
midline.  
ELW  Elytral width—combined elytral  
widths at longitudinal midpoint.  
SEL  Postscutellar elytral length—  
length of elytra along suture from  
posterior margin of scutellum to  
apex.  
ELH  Elytral height—measured along  
imaginary axis between halfway  
points of elytral dorsum and lat 
eral margin in lateral view.  
MSL  Mesosternal length—measured at  
midline.  
MTL  Metasternal length—measured at  
midline.  
MTW  Metasternal width—measured  
between posterolateral corners.  
TBL  Total body length—the sum of  
head length (MDL)  pronotum  
length (PNL)  postscutellar ely 
tral length (SEL).  

MFD Metasternal fovea dimension— 
greatest width. Antennomeres Length of antennomeres—mea-I–XI sured along dorsal midline. 
CRANIUM (gs. 9–12): Prognathous, very broadly quadrate (cf. gs. 11, 12); dorsoventrally compressed (gs. 9, 10), height less than one-third cranial width; wider than long (OHW/MDL  1.4); vertex large, at; with distinct supraocular ridge from edge of clypeus nearly to posterior margin of head; postocular temporum short, not prominent in dorsal view; eyes anterolaterally positioned, rounded in dorsal view, more angulate in ventral view, nely faceted; genae broad, each nearly as wide as clypeus; clypeus quadrate; frontoclypeal suture faint medially, incompletely separating clypeus from frons; gular sutures convergent posteriorly and slightly divergent at apices; ventral antennal grooves present between eyes and gular sutures, convergent posteriorly, shallowly impressed; occipital foramen small, about one-third width of cranium (g. 9); tentorium with distinct anterior and posterior bridges (g. 9); antenna inserted anterior to eye, beneath supraocular ridge (g. 10). 
Members of other species of Agathidium (especially the A. concinnum and A. pulchrum groups) often have a moderately distinct crease extending transversely across the medial portion of the head. With the head fully extended forward, this crease receives the anterior, curved margin of the pronotum. Agathidium oniscoides lacks this crease. 
ANTENNA (gs. 13, 14): Short, with abrupt 3-segmented club; antennomere I large, narrow and geniculate at base, wider distally, with sparse setae; antennomere II short, wide; antennomere III elongate, much longer than II, slightly expanded at apex, with sparse setae, including subapical circle of larger setae; antennomeres IV and V short, wider in apical half, with sparse ne setae and subapical circle of larger ones; antennomeres VII and VIII short and comparatively more transverse, with comparable setation; antennomeres IX and X subquadrate, similarly proportioned, with dense ne setation, and subapical ‘‘ring’’ of larger setae; antennomere XI elongate, narrowed apically, surface similar to antennomeres IX and X.

MALE SEXUAL DIMORPHISM 
Male and female Agathidium differ in a number of secondary sexual characters. Males have enlarged basal tarsomeres on the front and middle pairs of legs and dense, spatulate ventral setae on the expanded tarsomeres, a metasternal fovea, a metafemoral tooth, and (in some) mandibular tusks. Each is described for male A. oniscoides and discussed in general below. 
PRO-AND MESOBASOTARSOMERES: Three basal tarsomeres of front (g. 30) and middle leg moderately laterally expanded, with dense ventral pad of elongate, spatulate setae. 
METASTERNAL FOVEA (g. 21): Small, round, located medially, bearing tuft of long, golden setae. 
The metasternal fovea is present in almost all male Agathidium, although its placement, size, and shape vary considerably. It is always found at the midline. It is usually located near the center of the metasternum, but is sometimes placed near its anterior or posterior margin. The fovea is single or, more rarely, paired. It can be minute and punctiform, larger and circular, or very large and transversely arcuate in shape. The fovea usually bears a tuft of long, ne, golden setae that each stand individually erect or are, frequently, pasted together as a brush. 
Similar foveae are found in other male Agathidiini, including Anisotoma species (Wheeler, 1979b). Foveae are also sometimes found on the labium in this taxon. Faustini (1980) and Faustini et al. (1981) examined

horn is sometimes posteriorly curved and bears a tuft of apical setae. At least two apparently distinct kinds of horns occur that may not be homologous with one another. In one form the apex of the mandible is prolonged and dorsally recurved into a hornlike structure (e.g., A. aristerium; Wheeler, 1987). In others, such as A. pulchrum, a tusk arises from the dorsal surface of the mandible, posteriorly removed from the apex, which remains unmodied (see Frontispiece). It is conceivable that one represents a state modied from the other. From a strictly morphological perspective, however, it seems more reasonable to suppose that these represent independent modications of the left, male mandible, but perhaps with some shared developmental genetic coding considering the unusual asymmetry of the structure. 
MALE GENITALIA 
Figures 32–34 

AEDEAGUS: The aedeagus in members of Agathidium is trilobate and characteristic of ‘‘primitive’’ staphylinoids (Crowson, 1955). The basic structure consists of a tubular and curved median lobe, paired lateral lobes which are usually nearly as long as the median lobe and joined basally by the phallobase (formed by a ring like structure encircling the base of the median lobe), and a subapical opening on the ventral face of the median lobe (the distal orice). In Agathidium the distal orice is usually partially covered by a sclerotized ap (the operculum or ‘‘ventral piece’’; Wheeler, 1979b). This structure is highly variable in shape between species and is often an important source of taxonomic information. It is usually clearly articulable basally, but in some cases is apparently not. For the purposes of this revision, any structure extending over the distal orice from its base is regarded as an operculum, though not all these structures may be necessarily homologous. Internal to the median lobe is a membranous, saclike endophallus which bears a variety of armature in the form of spines, hairs, and sclerotized patches in addition to apical or subapical membranous lobes in the form of elongate digits or lanceolate structures. The median lobe, at least near the apex, and the lateral lobes exhibit a variety of patterns in the distribution of ‘‘pores’’ and ‘‘ducts’’ (see below). 
MEDIAN LOBE (gs. 32–34): In A. oniscoides the median lobe is elongate, narrow, ventrally curved through its midlength (most sharply near the basal piece), and recurved in the apical one-fth. The apical portion (one-fth) is dorsoventrally compressed relative to the basal portions of the median lobe. The basal piece is completely fused to the median lobe dorsally. 
‘‘PORES AND DUCTS’’ OF MEDIAN LOBE (g. 32): The terms ‘‘pore’’ and ‘‘duct’’ are used advisedly. ‘‘Pore’’ has been applied broadly in the larval literature for a variety of structures, including campaniform sensilla (Ashe and Watrous, 1984). In Agathidium genitalia the exact nature of the pores has not been determined. However, based on compound microscopy and a limited amount of scan

They may be reservoirs of secretary In A. oniscoides the ducts of the median lobe radiate from a central region, lining the sides and rounding the apex of the apical one-fth of the median lobe (g. 32). 
LATERAL LOBES (g. 32): The lateral lobes of A. oniscoides are slightly widened at the middle and are narrower at their apices. Pores are irregularly distributed over the surface, but they are more dense apically and absent basally. Two subequal setae are present subapically. 
OPERCULUM (gs. 32–34): The operculum is narrowed gradually. Its apex is abruptly wider, forming an apical knob. Pores are present at the apex only. There is some variation in the operculum within the species, particularly in the degree of pronouncement of the apical knob. 
ENDOPHALLUS (g. 33): The endophallus in 
A. oniscoides, like in other Agathidium,is typically inverted, and details of its structure are difcult to discern. When everted, the endophallus can be seen to be complex (g. 33). In A. oniscoides there are few sclerotizations except for a number of long tentacle-like subdivisions of the sac. There are two bifurcate structures that are wrinkled in appearance and several smaller ones, including two smooth, very sharply pointed processes. 
Details of endophallic structure have been difcult to assess in the genus. No reliable technique was found for its eversion. Sometimes gentle heating of the uid, particularly of glycerin, will lead to eversion, but this is not entirely predictable and certainly cannot be counted on for species where large numbers of specimens are not available for dissection. When such techniques or large enough numbers of specimens to support trial-and-error approaches do exist, many additional characters will certainly be found. We predict that the number of endophallic features may well surpass the number of external genitalic ones when they are examined in detail. The ngerlike subdivisions of the sac in A. oniscoides, for example, are present in closely related species and are potentially synapomorphic. 
FEMALE SEXUAL DIMORPHISM 
The only dimorphism found in females involves a reduction in the number of tarsomeres. As in other members of the tribe Agathidiini ( Anisotomini auctorum ), male and female tarsal formulae differ. Whereas the numbers of tarsomeres vary among males, females consistently have a reduced number in comparison to the male of the same species (e.g  5–5–4 /  5–4–4 or  5–4–4 /  4–4–4). 
FEMALE GENITALIA 
Figures 36, 37 

Female genitalia (g. 37) short, membranous; proctiger broadly rounded; coxite narrow, elongate, cylindrical with moderate number of small pores, few small subapical setae; stylus small, narrow, elongate with single long apical seta, pair of short subapical setae. 
SPERMATHECA (g. 36): Spermatheca elongate, curved; with capsule large, bulbous at base; neck narrow, curved; apex rounded, blunt; walls thick and lumen paralleling capsule shape; very long, narrow spermathecal duct inserted into bulb; membranous, amorphous gland inserted near base of spermathecal duct.

TAXONOMY 
An apparent synapomorphy of the tribe Agathidiini ( Anisotomini) is the sexually dimorphic tarsal formulae. The number of tarsomeres is greater in males than in females with the infrequent exception of when 4–4– 4 tarsi (or, even more rarely, 4–4–3) occur in both sexes of certain species. Whereas male tarsomere numbers are variable, they are usually heteromerous and greater than female tarsomere numbers whether heteromerous or not, for example,  5–5–4 /  5– 4–4 and  5–4–4 /  4–4–4. Agathidiines are small, about 1–6 mm in length, round, and convex. Most are glabrous or very nearly so, and with rare exceptions (e.g., Anisotoma basalis, Agathidium pulchrum, A. maculos

ere narrower than either the seventh or ninth (which are generally more equal in size), creating a characteristically interrupted 5-segmented antennal club. Most Agathidium, however, have the seventh antennomere reduced in size also, and thus they typically possess an abrupt 3-segmented club. In some species of Agathidium the seventh antennomere is slightly larger than the eighth, but both are still much narrower than the ninth. In the few cases when Agathidium has the seventh antennomere large enough to possibly be interpreted as part of a 5-segmented antennal club, the postocular temporum and supraocular carinae are prominent and conspicuous, a character combination not found in related taxa like Anisotoma. 
Species of Agathidium were rst recognized by Linnaeus (1758) and Fabricius (1792). The genus was proposed by Panzer (1797) for Silpha seminulum Linnaeus ( Agathidium globosum Panzer). The rst New World species of Agathidium described was 
A. oniscoides Palisot de Beauvois (1817), being one of the largest and most common species native to the United States. The rst comprehensive revision of the genus was done by Horn (1880) in his classic treatment of the Silphidae. The second and most recent taxonomic revision was completed by Fall (1934). 

Four described genera of Agathidiini are currently recognized in North and Central America and may be distinguished by the following diagnostic key. Keys to the world genera are provided by Angelini and Peck (2000), along with a cladogram for genera of the tribe, and by Peck et al. (2000) for Central and South American genera. In this last treatment the authors also included two putatively undescribed genera which we will be treating separately. A catalog and complete bibliographies and synonymies of world genera are provided by Newton (1998), along with comments on some of the numerous problems with classication of the group.

Cainosternum Notman 
Cainosternum Notman, 1921: 147 (Type species: Cainosternum imbricatum Notman, 1921, by monotypy); Hatch, 1929; Wheeler, 1986; Newton, 1998. 
DISCUSSION: The genus Cainosternum was originally described from western New York state by Notman (1921) based upon a single specimen of Cainosternum imbricatum Not-man. The senior author has made numerous trips to the type locality in Chautauqua County in the vicinity of Westeld in search of this unusual species but failed to collect it from either slime-molds or sifted leaf litter. However, while collecting ightless Agathidium species in the Appalachian Mountains of western North Carolina, C. imbricatum was rediscovered (Wheeler, 1986). No identiable inclusions were observed in the gut of the North Carolina material, and habits of this elusive species remain unknown. Sexually dimorphic tarsal formulae suggest that the genus belongs within Agathidiini. If this is so, then the widespread and putatively ancestral associations of Agathidiini with Myxomycetes suggest possible slime-mold predation. Plasmodial feeding would be consistent with both the absence of microscopically recognizable material in the gut and absence of specimens on exposed fruiting bodies. Although this inference is not fully justied by available data, such speculation does provide one logical place to search for Cainosternum in the future. 
Cainosternum was excluded from Agathidiini and placed in the tribe Pseudoliodini by Newton (1998) and Peck (1998). While pointing out the similarity of this taxon to members of Pseudoliodini, Newton (1998) also remarked that Cainosternum could represent the basal member of the tribe Agathidiini. This taxon does possess an unusual character combination. Since there is no comprehesive cladistic analysis of members of the various tribes of Leiodinae and, therefore, no good hypotheses for the relative plesiomorphy or apomorphy of characters used to group these taxa, we have elected to retain this taxon within Agathidiini until such analyses can be presented.

DISCUSSION: Species of Anisotoma are among the most common, widespread, and abundant slime-mold-associated Coleoptera in North and Central America. In general habitus, some species of Agathidium (e.g., Ag. sexstriatum and Ag. concinnum groups) strongly resemble Anisotoma species (e.g., g. 41), from which they may be distinguished by their distinct 3-segmented antennal club or continuation of the supraocular carina posterior of the eye, setting off a distinct posterior temporum. 
Anisotoma species of North America were revised by Wheeler (1979b). Since that revision, a few species have been added from Me´xico and Panama´ (Wheeler, 1980, 1983). Based on the paucity of specimens collected from Me´xico and Central America to date and the high proportion of undescribed species found among them, it seems likely that the number of species of Anisotoma will be signicantly greater than that now known. 
Most slime-mold host records of Anisotoma are in association with mature sporocarps (Blackwell, 1984; Lawrence and Newton, 1980; Stephenson et al., 1994; Wheeler, 1979b, 1984a), although plasmodial feeding has been observed (Newton, 1984; Russell, 1979; Wheeler, 1980).

DISCUSSION: The genus Stetholiodes was described from northern Indiana by Fall (1910), based on material collected from moss (Blatchley, 1910). Wheeler (1981) redescribed S. laticollis Fall and discussed this single North American member of the genus. Additional species are known from Asia and eastern Europe (Angelini and de Marzo, 1987b). Monophyly of the genus has not been rmly established. Habits remain unknown, though slime-mold associations in related genera suggest similar relationships in this taxon.

DIAGNOSIS: Agathidium may be distinguished from other Agathidiini in North and Central America by the following combination of characters: antennal club usually distinctly 3-segmented (5-segmented in a few taxa, including A. rusticum Fall); anterior clypeal margin usually not extending beyond anterolateral margins of frons (extending beyond frons in the A. sexstriatum group and several species of the A. pulchrum and A. concinnum groups); supraocular carina extending from margin of clypeus or clypeal region posteriorly to well behind eye delimiting a postocular temporum that may be short and inconspicuous or long and very conspicuous; elytral punctation usually confused or absent, occasionally serial, but with fewer than nine series and series often obscured by dense confused punctures between; prothorax convex; elytra usually convex, sometimes dorsoventrally compressed. 
DISCUSSION: The name Agathidium is derived from ‘‘agathidion’’, Greek for ‘‘small ball’’, and is quite appropriate for many species of the genus which have broad convex bodies capable of rolling into compact, ball-like shapes when disturbed. 
A complete bibliography and synonymic list for Agathidium is provided by Newton (1998) along with a discussion of some nomenclatural problems including the observation that the original name for this taxon, Volvoxis, is not a homonym as supposed. Volvoxis is the oldest name for the genus, and historically the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (the Code) would have required either resurrection of the name Volvoxis for this genus or a special ruling by the Commission for conservation of the junior name Agathidium and suppression of Volvoxis. However, according to article 23.9 of the newest Code (ICZN, 1999), the prevailing usage of a junior name may be maintained when the senior name has not been used as a valid name after 1899 (to our knowledge true of Volvoxis) and the junior name has been used as a presumed valid name in at least 25 works published by at least 10 authors in the preceding 50 years and a span of not less than 10 years (true of Agathidium, see bibliography above). Therefore, of the two names Volvoxis Kugelann and Agathidium Panzer, the second is the valid name. 
Agathidium has historically been divided into subgenera, several of which were proposed as recently as the 1980s and 1990s (Angelini, 1993; Angelini and De Marzo, 1986). Subgenera recognized for the Palearctic fauna can be used to organize the Nearctic fauna, though with considerable difculty in some cases, and they may be identied using Angelini’s (1995) key. However, because our fauna remains poorly known, and monophyly of the subgenera as currently classied remains equivocal, we have decided to not recognize subgenera and instead arrange the species treated here into informal species groups. Our proposed species groups would loosely belong to previously recognized subgenera in the following way: A. brevisternum group  A.(Neoceble) des Gozis; A. oniscoides group  A.(Agathidium); A. revolvens group  A.(Neoceble) (centered around 
A. nigripenne Fabricius); A. concinnum group  A.(Cyphoceble) Thomson; A. pulchrum group  A.(Neoceble). Our A. iota and A. compressidens species groups do not 

appear to t well into any of the described subgenera. 
Especially problematic are those species described by Horn and later placed in their own subgenus, A.(Rhabdoelytrum), by Hlisnikovsky´ (1964). According to our scheme of species groups, the A. sexstriatum group would belong to this subgenus. According to the characters used by Angelini and de Marzo (1987b) to distinguish Agathidium from Stetholiodes, the species of A.(Rhabdoelytrum) would key to Stetholiodes. For now, these controversial and primitive forms are retained in Agathidium although there is merit in considering a different combination. Considering only our fauna, such a combination would appear to make Agathidium species monophyletic, based in part on the relatively excavate clypeus or clypeal region, while making monophyly of Stetholiodes uncertain and based primarily on symplesiomorphic character states. 
There have been two cladistic analyses including members of this tribe. Considering the world genera of the tribe, and a small data set of adult characters, Angelini and Peck (2000) proposed the following relationships: (Anisotoma  (Amphicyllis  (Liodopria  (Cyrtoplastus  (Sphaeroliodes  (Stetholiodes  (Afroagathidium  (Pseudoagathidium  (Besuchetionella  (Agathidium))))))))). Relationships among non-Agathidium taxa are beyond the scope of this work, but see Miller and Wheeler (in press) for a discussion of their conclusions. 
Kilian (1998) also conducted a cladistic analysis of agathidiine taxa, but one using larval instead of adult characters. She suggested synonymizing Anisotoma with Agathidium based on the conclusion that Agathidium species are nested in several places within Anisotoma. However, Kilian’s analysis was based on a relatively limited data set including only characters from larvae and only those from the relatively few species of agathidiines known from larvae (including only several species of Agathidium and Anisotoma and one species of Liodopria). Another recent analysis by Angelini and Peck (2000) (see above) used adult characters coded from many more taxa representing a greater diversity within Agathidiini. They found a solution to the phylogeny radically different from Kilian’s (1998). Further analyses incorporating more comprehensive taxon and character sampling are likely to result in different results from each of these. Thus, we would regard any nomenclatural change based on Kilian’s (1998) phylogeny to be injudicious at this time. In addition, whereas we would agree that such a conclusion as she presents would call for synonymy of the two names, doing so would likely serve little except to make Agathidium even more heterogeneous in character combinations than it already is. We think that were Agathidium or Anisotoma eventually found to be paraphyletic, it would be more appropriate to break up these two huge groups of species into genera rather than synonymizing them. 
Agathidium are sometimes misidentied in collections with the following taxa, from which they may be distinguished by characters given parenthetically: Anisotoma (g. 
41: Agathidium with head not narrowed immediately behind eye [except in some A. pulchrum and A. sexstriatum species groups] and with antennal club rarely approaching 5segmented); Clambidae (Agathidium never with enlarged hind coxal plates); cybocephaline Nitidulidae (Agathidium with front coxae conical, not transverse); acanthocerine Scarabaeidae (Agathidium with antennae not lamellate); sphaeridiine Hydrophilidae (Agathidium with club not so compact). 
During this revision three species previously placed in Agathidium, A. cognatum Matthews, 1887: 77, A. parile Fall, 1934: 117, and A. parvulum LeConte, 1878: 598, were discovered to belong to a separate genus along with several undescribed Central and South American species. These species are treated in a separate revision (Miller and Wheeler, in press).

AGATHIDIUM SEXSTRIATUM SPECIES 
GROUP 

DIAGNOSIS: The A. sexstriatum species group is distinguished by the following combination of characters: head narrowed behind eye, without prolonged postocular temporum (g. 44); body not strongly convex dorsally and not contractile (gs. 49); elytron with 2– 8 serial series of punctures; aedeagus with ventral operculum divided into two plates; male tarsal formula 5–5–4, female 4–4–4; pronotum with evident posterolateral angles (g. 52); clypeus large, separated from frons by impressed frontoclypeal suture, protruding anteriorly, from one-third to one-half of clypeus anterad of lateral margins of frons (g. 52). 
DISCUSSION: The A. sexstriatum species group includes three similar species rst described by Horn (1880). Hlisnikovsky´ (1964) proposed the subgenus Rhabdoelytrum for these species. As discussed above, it is conceivable that these species are related to Stetholiodes or other genera (Angelini and de Marzo, 1987b; Angelini and Peck, 2000). They are conservatively maintained in Agathidium until analyses are completed. Species of the group are distributed in the western United States. 
This group includes species that exhibit no observed unequivocal synapomorphies, although the rather short and broad form of the median lobe of the aedeagus, serial series of punctures, and prominently protruding clypeus make these species separable from other Agathidium included in this study. The latter character refers to forms in which the clypeus protrudes clearly beyond the anterior an

Due to a large number of antennal club and distinct supraocular carinae distinguish these Agathidium from all Anisotoma species and other genera. 
Circumscription of these species is based on external characters, including color and punctation patterns, and male aedeagal shape. Although external characters are used extensively in the key, these features are somewhat less reliable than male aedeagal shape and, when possible, male specimens should be dissected and aedeagal shape compared with the illustrations for the most reliable identications.

DISCUSSION: Depending upon variation among individuals and the angle of light under which specimens are examined, evidence of serial punctation is variable. Whereas series are not as prominent as in A. sexstriatum and A. bistriatum, given proper illumination six or more serial rows of punctures can generally be seen among the dense and slightly smaller punctures present between them. Some specimens, possibly teneral ones, have the head and especially pronotum reddish in contrast to distinctly darker reddish elytra. In some of these bicolored specimens (e.g., Ouray, Colorado; Norval Flats, California) the apex of the median lobe is more gradually narrowed than in most other specimens and the ventral operculum is slightly more elongate. In the most extreme cases, specimens from Cochise Co., Arizona, have the pronotum rather brightly orange-red in sharp contrast to the dark head and elytra. Another specimen, from Douglas City, Trinity Co., California, is similar, but with reddish clypeus and labrum also. The latter material is so brilliantly bicolored as to be confused with 
A. sexstriatum initially. The dense elytral punctation, smaller serial punctures, and less parallel-sided elytra distinguish such specimens from A. sexstriatum. Unfortunately, all

these specimens are females so that their conspecicity with other A. estriatum rests on these external features alone. Considering this structural variation, the broad geographic distribution of the species, and the paucity of existing specimens, infraspecic variation and the possibility of more than one species here should be reconsidered when sufcient numbers of specimens have accumulated. Other specimens, however, are more uniformly darkly colored, aside from pale markings of the pronotum. 
A series of specimens from Arizona (Hospital Flat) are labeled as having been collected from a ‘‘daldinia-like fungus’’, which could easily describe Lycoperdales slime-molds. The species has also been reported from the myxomycete, Fuligo septica (Lawrence and Newton, 1980). Specimens have been collected from a variety of forest litter types, including ponderosa pine, white r, cedar, spruce, lodgepole pine, and others. Elevation records are from 2200 to 9200 ft. 
AGATHIDIUM BREVISTERNUM SPECIES GROUP 
DIAGNOSIS: The A. brevisternum group species may be recognized by the following combination of characters: minute size, extreme convexity, strong contractility (gs. 80, 81), tusked left male mandible (not present on all males) (gs. 80, 81), exceptionally short metasternum with meso-and metacoxae nearly touching, aptery, disproportionately large and broad head (g. 80), articles of antennal stem very elongate, narrow, parallel-sided with subapical whorl of setae. 
DISCUSSION: Although the extremely shortened metasternum of this group is undoubtedly apomorphic and unusual within the genus, its potential synapomorphic signicance is less convincing. This is because such shortened metasterna are correlated with ightlessness in other Coleoptera and, like other loss characters, can mask convergence. Nonetheless, this short metasternum combined with the minute size, disproportionately large cranium, and horned left male mandible combine to make the species assigned to this group distinct and easily identied. 
The ventral operculum of the median lobe is very thin and fragile and, after clearing, is easily overlooked. Care must be taken in preparing the aedeagus so as to not make the operculum too transparent. A pair of sclerotized structures on the endophallus are more evident in cleared specimens than is the operculum. 
The majority of these species are identiable at this time based only upon the shape of the median lobe.

The carina bordering the anterior margin of the cranium is more distinctly sinuate above the bases of the antennae than in A. brevisternum which, in combination with the sinuate pair of sclerites of the endophallus of the aedeagus (gs. 91– 93), distinguishes A. rhinocerellum from that species. 
DESCRIPTION: Body very broadly rounded, strongly convex and partially contractile (gs. 89, 90); TBL  2.25 mm. Color dark reddish-brown to black, eyes pale, venter and appendages yellowish-brown, antenna pale, concolorous.

Pronotum very broad, convex; anterior margin posterior to head emarginate, nearly straight; posterior angles weakly dened; surface shiny, nearly impunctate, as on head, except punctures slightly less dense (g. 87); PNW/ PNL  0.7; PNL/PNH  1.2; PNW/PNH  
1.7. Combined elytral width, in dorsal view, slightly greater than length; ELW/SEL  1.02; in posterior view, apex attenuate; sutural stria evident in apical half; surface shiny, nearly impunctate, as on pronotum (g. 88); epipleuron very wide, bordered by sharp carinae, ending shortly before apex of elytron. Mesosternum large, simple; without lateral carinae; without median carina; surface microscopically alutaceous; posterior portion between mesocoxae triangular; MSL/ MTL  1.4. Metasternum very short medially, sides at widest point shorter than mesosternum medially, narrowed to bands between meso-and metacoxae, narrower than one-half maximum width of metacoxa; surface with microscopic alutaceous pattern; anterior margin between mesocoxae elevated as transverse carina; MTL/MTW  0.14. 
Male tarsi 5–5–4; pro-and mesobasotarsomeres slightly expanded, with spatulate ventral setae; metasternal fovea median, punctiform, with few long setae; metafemur narrow, without tooth; left mandible usually with dorsally directed, curved, apically blunt tusk arising dorsally from side near base of mandible, with tuft of apical setae (gs. 89, 90). Aedeagus with median lobe short, par-allel-sided, narrowed at apex (gs. 91, 92); apical pores reaching margin numbering approximately 24, with similar number not attaining margin, pores more or less longitudinally oriented and parallel to one another; lateral lobes narrow, terminating at point of median lobe constriction at about apex of operculum, with paired subapical setae, and moderately dense, irregularly distributed pores along length (g. 92); endophallus with two membranous apical winglike aps; with paired, median, strongly sinuate sclerites (gs. 92, 93). 

Female tarsi 5–4–4; spermatheca not observed. 
ETYMOLOGY: This species is named from rhino, Greek for ‘‘nose’’, keros, Greek for ‘‘horn’’, and the diminutive sufx ‘‘ellum’’. The name reects both the rhinoceroslike horn on the left male mandible and the diminutive size of beetles of this species. 
DISTRIBUTION: This species is only known from western Oregon (g. 82).

DISCUSSION: One female from Douglas Co., Oregon, is tentatively assigned to this species because the supraantennal carina is more strongly sinuate above the antennal insertion. All measurements were taken from the holotype with the exception of antennomeres VII, VIII, and IX. Because the apical portion of the antenna of the type was not visible, apical antennomeres of the paratype were measured instead. One specimen was collected from ‘‘moss and ground litter’’. A single host record is from Fuligo septica (Russell, 1979).

Aedeagus with short, stout median lobe, narrowed at apex in ventral view, curved ventrad with apex recurved dorsad (g. 95); operculum with sclerotized basal and lateral areas forming deeply emarginate, divided parts, the apices of which bear two pores and the medial surfaces of which are not excavated, the distal region between two sclerotized ‘‘arms’’ connected by truncate, transparent, extremely ne, membranelike structure (g. 95); lateral lobes gradually narrowed apically, subapical setae similar in size (gs. 94, 95) (foreshortened due to angle of vision in ventral drawing, g. 95). 
Female tarsi 5–4–4; spermatheca not examined. 
ETYMOLOGY: This species is named from di, Latin for ‘‘two’’, and operculum, Latin for ‘‘lid’’, in reference to the deeply divided operculum of the median lobe in males of this species. 
DISTRIBUTION: This species is only known from the type locality in extreme northwestern California (g. 82). 
PARATYPES: UNITED STATES: California: Del Norte Co.: Crescent City, 24 Apr 1991, pine duff, berlese, TR Haig (4, CASC, deposited from California Department of Food and Agriculture). 
DISCUSSION: This form is hypothesized to be a distinct species largely because the connective structure between the two sclerotized lateral arms of the operculum was not seen in individuals of related species. Because this form appears to by sympatric with related species and because variation in some structures have been observed, including the number of pores on the operculum, it is possible that this is simply a variant of A. brevisternum. The type series was collected from pine duff.

AGATHIDIUM REVOLVENS SPECIES KEY TO A. REVOLVENS SPECIES 

GROUP 	GROUP 

DIAGNOSIS: Body convex, somewhat elongate, elytra sometimes distinctly dorsoventrally compressed; pronotum more or less convex; body partially contractile; color nearly uniform, pale to dark reddish-brown, rarely nearly black; head with postocular temporum more or less prominent, always much shorter than eye; tarsal formula male: female 5–5–4:5–4–4; mesosternum nearly horizontal between mesocoxae, divided into anterior and posterior parts, anterior part with distinct median carina; metasternum without paired oblique lines or, if present, no more than very short, indistinct traces; elytra usually distinctly punctate, punctures sometimes in more-or-less evident serial rows. 
DISCUSSION: Our A. revolvens species group appears to be related to certain Palearctic members of the subgenus A.(Neoceble) centered around A. nigripenne Fabricius. The group, as interpreted here, includes seven species recognized by Fall (1934) plus several species described as new. Fall (1934) separated these species into two informal groups. One group included species that, like 
A. revolvens, are relatively broadly oval. The other group included putatively related species that are comparatively dorsoventrally compressed and elongate, a form most fully expressed in A. depressum. The distinction between the comparatively broader, more convex forms and the elongate, more depressed forms is not consistent, however, and this supposed contrast is useful only in comparative descriptions of pairs of species. 
In general, the species in this group possess easily discerned differences in shape of the aedeagus, and dissection of males presents the best avenue for species identication. However, there are a number of external differences, including subtle variation in the type and degree of punctation on head, pronotum and elytron, body shape, and the male metasternal foveae. These characters are less consistent and require critical examination of specimens. The following key relies heavily on external characters. However, most certain species identication is best done by dissection of male specimens and comparison of aedeagi with the illustrations.

 in MCZC [LeConte Collection] labeled ‘‘[small green disc]/ Type 3178 [red and white label, number handwritten]/ A. revolvens Lec./ HOLOTYPE, Agathidium revolvens LeConte, 1850 [red label with black line border]’’. 
TYPE LOCALITY: Thought to be north shore of Lake Superior (United States, Minnesota, or Canada, Ontario) (exact locality unknown). 
DIAGNOSIS: This species is distinguishable from others in the group by the body broadly ovate (g. 107), the punctures on head somewhat smaller and less dense than those of pronotum, which are also small and weak (gs. 104, 105), the punctation of the elytron (g. 106) coarser and denser than that of pronotum and head, the elytral punctation confused, but with more-or-less evident serial arrangement of punctures (g. 106), the sutural stria, and approximately three additional parallel, incompletely impressed striae. The head has a single pair of setose punctures near the posterolateral corners of the poorly dened clypeus, with these punctures being much larger than others on the head. 
DESCRIPTION: Body broadly elongate oval, partially contractile, only moderately convex (gs. 107, 108); TBL  3.6 mm. Color of head and elytron dark reddish-brown, nearly black, pronotum and clypeal spot paler reddish-brown, mouthparts and appendages pale reddish-testaceous.

as ‘‘A. revolvens’’ are not conspecic with the unique type specimen taken from the northern shore of Lake Superior by LeConte, nor are specimens in the Horn collection determined to be ‘‘A. revolvens’’ actually assignable to this species. No additional specimens attributable to this species were examined during this study, either. Thus, A. revolvens remains known from the female type specimen alone. Apical portions of the antennae of this specimen are missing, and the ventral sclerites were not measured.

DISTRIBUTION: Agathidium depressum was reported by Fall (1934) from British Columbia, Seward and McKinley Park, Alaska, Edmonton, Alberta, and Montreal and Rigaud, Quebec. Another specimen from Urbana, Illinois, was ‘‘doubtfully referred’’ to the species by Fall. We did not examine this specimen, but it may be better assigned to A. dubitans. Fall also assigned two specimens from California of the type series of A. revolvens in the LeConte collection to A. depressum. The species is the most broadly distributed of the species in this group (g. 99).

DISCUSSION: Based on Hatch’s (1957: pl. IV, g. 20) key and illustration of the male genitalia, his concept of A. conjunctum appears to be the same as ours of A. omissum. This may have led to his description of a new species (A. obtusum Hatch) for specimens that we regard to be A. conjunctum (see below under treatment of A. conjunctum). 
This species has been collected from ‘‘squirrel middens under conifer’’ and elevations from 7700 to 9300.

SPECIMENS EXAMINED: CANADA: British Columbia: Toco, 28 Apr 1984, R and J Camenisch (1, PECK); Queen Charlotte Islands, Moresby Island, 2.5 mi N Mosquito Lake Campground, 5 Jun 1984, Spruce forest litter, RS Anderson (1, PECK); Charlotte Islands, Graham Island 1 mi NW Tlell, 27 Jun 1984, Sitka spruce, hemlock forest, RS Anderson (1, PECK); Stickeen R. Canyon, Liebeck (1, MCZC). 
DISCUSSION: There have been no reported hosts. The type was collected from ‘‘sifting moss’’. Other specimens have been collected from spruce and hemlock forests. 
Two female specimens reported from the type locality were reported by Fall (1934), but these appear to have been returned to 
C.A. Frost, are not at the MCZC, and were not examined by us.

DISCUSSION: The holotype of A. hebetatum Hatch (USNM) was examined and found to be a synonym of A. virile based on similarity in punctation and shape of the median lobe of the aedeagus. This specimen is well within the variation of typical members of A. virile. 

Agathidium virile is a common and morphologically variable species in the far western region of the United States. Specimens assigned to this species are diverse in punctation and, to a certain extent, in the form of the aedeagus. The elytra are densely punctate, but the punctures vary from rather feebly impressed to very deep and coarsely impressed. Among those with coarse elytral punctation, punctures of the head and especially the pronotum may be somewhat smaller but similarly strikingly coarse and deep ranging to rather small and decidedly weakly impressed. The apex of the median lobe varies from slender and gradually narrowed to more broadly expanded. The branches of the operculum vary from very slender and elongate to distinctly broader, but generally the branches are narrowed medially with the apices broadly expanded and truncate. 
It is possible that additional species exists within what we regard as A. virile. However, no correlations were found among these variable traits that suggest a reasonable inference of species status for any of the included variable specimens, and we regard the species as simply polymorphic. A male from Stanford, California (CASC), has a relatively broad median lobe apex, gradually broadened and apically spatulate ventral opercula, in combination with rather weakly impressed pronotal and elytral punctation. In this sense it is somewhat intermediate in condition with 
A. angustoperculum. Considering the known variation within A. virile, however, this specimen is most reasonably assigned here for the present. Another specimen from Santa Clara County, California (CNMH), and one from Linn County, Oregon (PECK), are tentatively assigned to this species and have the apical portion of the median lobe much more slender than in most specimens, with the lateral margins nearly parallel. 
A specimen from McClure’s Beach, Marine County, California (CASC), was collected from ‘‘rock crevices, upper intertidal’’, though this must certainly be an accidental occurrence for this species.

DISCUSSION: Agathidium obtusum Hatch is synonymized here with this species based on Hatch’s (1957) description and illustration of the ventral view of the aedeagus. His specimens appear to t well within the range of variation observed for A. conjunctum. Hatch’s (1957: pl. IV, g. 20) concept of A. conjunctum appears to actually refer to A. omissum based on the key and his illustration of the male genitalia. 
Agathidium conjunctum has been collected frequently under bark of various trees, including pine and oak. It has also been collected from various litter types, including oak leaf litter and pine duff. Elevation records are from 2900 to 4200 ft.

Elytra very wide; length slightly more than greatest width; slightly attenuate at apex; humeri not angulate, broadly obtuse; punctures much larger and more coarsely impressed than those of head and pronotum, irregularly distributed and moderately dense, distance between punctures about 0.5–2.0 diameter of single puncture, surface between smooth, shiny, with microscopic, nearly invisible and very sparse micropunctules and random faint curving lines (g. 171). Mesosternum divided into anterior and posterior parts; anterior part with longitudinal median carina and ne alutaceous sculpturing; with oblique carinae and lateral, longitudinal carinae. Metasternum nely alutaceous, with laterally curved, concentric, rugose ridges, surface covered by ne setae. MSL/MTL  0.8; MTL/MTW  
0.4. 
Male tarsi 5–5–4; with pro-and mesobasotarsomeres moderately expanded laterally; left mandible not modied; metafemur with conspicuous, broad, subapical tooth with small median protruding point; metasternal fovea in large anteromedial oval depression,

transverse, with long ne setae (g. 172). Aedeagus with median lobe elongate, robust, ventrally curved, in lateral view slightly recurved dorsally subapically, apical 1/5 dorsoventrally compressed and laterally narrowed before apex (g. 176); in ventral view apex of median lobe narrowed, more-or-less arrowhead-shaped, with fanlike arrangement of ducts apically (g. 176); operculum deeply bisected into pieces, each elongate, broad, with medial margin concave, curved, apex pointed and directed medially (g. 177); lateral lobes long, gradually narrowed before apex that is slightly expanded subapically in ventral view, with pair of subapical setae and irregularly distributed pores (gs. 175, 176); endophallic armature not extensive. 
Female tarsi 5–4–4. 

ETYMOLOGY: This species is named from the words falcatus, Latin for ‘‘curved’’, and operculum Latin for ‘‘lid’’, signifying the curved condition of the rami of the operculum of the median lobe. 
DISTRIBUTION: This species is distributed in the Pacic Northwest (g. 100).

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS 
This study has proted from the advice, counsel, and encouragement of many colleagues, only some of which are singled out for acknowledgment here. To those who have contributed to the project in one or more ways and who are inadvertently omitted go thanks and apologies. The senior author thanks C.A. Triplehorn (The Ohio State University), his advisor, mentor, and friend, for taking an aspiring undergraduate coleopterist on an expedition to Mexico that forged a commitment to the study of beetles (including Leiodidae), systematics, and biological diversity. L.E. Watrous accompanied him on several early collecting trips that were instrumental in elucidating the complex of ightless species of the Appalachians, and was a constant source of inspiration, sound advice, and stimulating theoretical arguments. K.C. Nixon (L. H. Bailey Hortorium, Cornell University) collaborated in the development of the phylogenetic species concept used here, is an eternal fountainhead of innovation and insights, and has made several versions of his programs ClaDOS, Dada, MDP, and Win-Clada available. The following students, friends, colleagues, wife, and children assisted on one or more collecting trips: B. Lindsay, J.V. McHugh, J. Pakaluk, D. Peters, 

K.A. Wheeler, K.J. Wheeler, and M.A. Wheeler. 
Without the generous lending of material from collections listed in the appendix this work would have not been possible. Curators enumerated therein are heartily thanked. Long-term loans by the Canadian National Collection, Field Museum of Natural History, and Museum of Comparative Zoology were especially valuable. 
This research was supported by grants from the U.S. National Science Foundation (BSR-8315457, BSR-8717401), the Highlands Biological Research Station Foundation, the American Philosophical Society, and the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences in Cornell University, especially Hatch Project NY(C)139426 to the senior author. 
Two individuals who completed an incredible amount of quality work, including dissections of specimens, library research, specimen measurement, working with databases, editing materials, and such, deserve special thanks: P.R. Fraissinet and J.V. McHugh. McHugh also provided a very useful and careful review of an earlier version of the manuscript. D.A. Grimaldi, while a graduate student at Cornell, developed strategies for measuring Agathidium. The late B. Alexander, also while a grad student, completed the frontispiece illustrations. Many individuals, particularly student assistants, have made important contributions to the database MYCOL over the past decades. Last, but foremost, F. Fawcett deserves considerable thanks for her superb scientic illustrations that combine artistic beauty with scientic precision and communicate as much or more than is possible through the text. Her contributions to this project are incalculable in quality and quantity.
