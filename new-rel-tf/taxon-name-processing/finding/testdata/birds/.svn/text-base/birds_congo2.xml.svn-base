				<head>THE BIRDS OF THE BELGIAN CONGO.  PART II<note n="1">Scientific results of the Congo Expedition.  Ornithology, No. 13.</note>
				</head>
				<head>BY JAMES P. CHAPIN</head>
				<head>PLATE I (FRONTISPIECE); PLATES II TO XXI; TEXT FIGURES 1 TO 38</head>
				<head>INTRODUCTION</head>
				<p>This second volume on the avifauna of the Belgian Congo includes the families <taxonName>Rallid&aelig</taxonName>; to <taxonName>Picid&aelig</taxonName>;.  It is expected that the <taxonName>Passeriformes</taxonName> will require two more volumes.</p>
				<p>While bringing the manuscript up to date, I have had the privilege of spending ten months at the Mus&eacute;e du Congo Belge, where the Director, Dr. H. Schouteden, has aided me in every way to study its abundant ornithological collections.  No other museum in the world has such a splendid representation of Congo birds.  There I had the great good fortune to discover two mounted specimens of <taxonName>Afropavo congensis</taxonName>,<note n="2">Chapin, 1936, Rev. Zool. Bot. Afr., XXIX, p. 2 (Sankuru district, Belg. Congo).</note> and this remarkable bird is figured in color as the frontispiece of the present volume.  My gratitude to Dr. Schouteden is difficult to express in full.  Unfailing support and encouragement in my work have been given by Dr. Frank M. Chapman.</p>
				<p>All my other friends in the ornithological world have given me their fullest co&ouml;peration, willingly examining specimens under their charge, loaning them to me whenever required, and helping with valuable advice. I wish to express my appreciation of this assistance, and in particular that rendered me by Professor Erwin Stresemann, Dr. David A. Bannerman, Mr. J. Berlioz, Dr. Herbert Friedmann, Mr. J. L. Peters, Dr. Witmer Stone, Professor Oscar Neumann, Dr. Moriz Sassi, Count Nils Gyldenstolpe, Mr. W.W. Bowen, Mr. W.E. Clyde Todd, and Mr. John T. Zimmer.</p>
				<p>To Miss Ruth M. Campbell and Mrs. Mary Gardner I am most deeply obliged for their efficient secretarial assistance, and Doctor Ernst Mayr and Mr. Charles E. O'Brien have aided me greatly by putting the Rothschild Collection at my disposition.  To the Works Progress Administration I am also indebted for the very efficient help it provided.</p>
				<p>The expense of printing the present volume has been borne by my good friend Charles W. Boise, who has helped me so generously in other ways, and especially in the investigation of the Congo peacock.</p>
				<p>In order to economize space in the lists of references it has been necessary
<pb n="3" id="t000120-p00009c.tif"/> to omit most repetitions of place-names.  Every locality in the Belgian Congo from which the species or race has been reported is mentioned, usually in connection with the reference where it first appeared. Subsequent mention of the same locality by the same or a different author is not noted, unless there be some special reason for so doing. Furthermore, the names of books and journals are cited in more abbreviated form than in Volume I.  A list of the shorter abbreviations is as follows:</p>

				<p>The Kaffir rail is secretive in habits, dwelling in marshes, and nesting in very wet spots amid rushes.  Its eggs are described as creamy white with profuse spotting of red-brown, purple, and gray, especially toward the obtuse end, 33.5&ndash;34.3 &times; 27.9 mm.  It was found nesting in Natal by A.D.

				<p>ADULTS.&mdash;Iris red or brownish red, rim of eyelids light brown; base of mandible and sides of maxilla near base green, rest of bill blackish; feet rufous-brown or grayish brown.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;West African forest region from Liberia east to the Ituri district, and south to the Gaboon coast and Lukolela on the middle Congo River.  I doubt the validity of <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Canirallus oculeus batesi">C. o. batesi</taxonName> Sharpe</taxon>,<note n="1">1900, B. B. O. C., X, p. lvi (Rio Benito).</note> for I have seen specimens from Liberia which were darker on the breast than some of ours from the Ituri, and at best it may only be said that Upper Guinea specimens are possibly a little lighter green above than those from the Cameroon.  The wings of eight males from the Belgian Congo measure 170&ndash;180 mm., and of four females 172&ndash;185. mm.</p>
				<p>In our series males tend to have the gray of the cheeks extending back over the ear-coverts, while in females the rufous of the neck comes up over the ear to the lower eyelid.  The type of <taxonName idx_name="Canirallus oculeus batesi">batesi</taxonName> seems to be a female.</p>
				<p><taxonName>Canirallus oculeus</taxonName> is a wood rail, and all our specimens were obtained from traps in much the same situations as those of Himantornis, along small watercourses and swamps in the forest.  In August, 1930, two males were secured alive from a native boy at Lukolela.  During the few days I kept them alive one bird occasionally uttered a fairly loud snore, lasting about two seconds.  When handled it also gave a brief &quot;coo,&quot; and another short note like &quot;chunk.&quot;  Four stomachs examined by us contained pebbles, small snails (in three cases), slugs (in one), a small crab, a millipede, and insect-remains, including two maggot-like larv&aelig; and a green caterpillar.</p>
				<p>At Niapu on December 9 two specimens were in breeding condition, while a female at Lukolela on November 16 had recently laid two or three eggs.  In both regions dry-season specimens were non-breeding. Likewise, in southern Cameroon, Bates was shown a nest beside a stream on April 7.  He obtained a downy black chick on March 2, and a larger young bird on July 27.  Breeding is therefore indicated over the greater part of the rainy season.</p>

				<p>The species inhabits the greater part of the Pal&aelig;arctic Region, and extends to Cape Province, Madagascar, Australia, and New Zealand. The resident East and South African race, <taxonName idx_name="Porzana pusilla obscura">obscura</taxonName>, is somewhat darker than the European form of Baillon&apos;s crake, <taxonName idx_name="Porzana pusilla intermedia">P. p. intermedia (Hermann)</taxonName>, and is found from Kenya Colony and Uganda, to Angola, Cape Province, and Madagascar.  It does not occur in the forests of western or central Africa, nor is it yet recorded from any point within the limits of the Belgian Congo.  It may well be looked for on the western shore of Lake Albert, since there was a specimen in the Jackson Collection from Butiaba on the east shore, taken on December 7, 1901.  It will probably be found in Ruanda or the Kivu District, and possibly in the Katanga.</p>

				<p>The genus <taxonName>&AElig;nigmatolimnas</taxonName>, proposed by J.L. Peters for this rail, was based on its deeper, more compressed bill and long hind toe; but I prefer not to separate it from <taxonName>Porzana</taxonName>.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;Here and there from Cape Province and Natal north to the vicinity of Mombasa, Cameroon, and Northern Nigeria; one record from Biskra in Algeria, another from Aldabra Island.  Hartert<note n="2">1921, `V&ouml;g. pal. Fauna,' III, p. 1834.</note> argued that the breeding range might be in Europe or western Asia; but females almost ready to lay have recently been taken by Bates<note n="3">1927, Ibis, p. 10.</note> in Nigeria, on June 30, and by Admiral Lynes in Northern Rhodesia on December 3.</p>
				<p>This rail was to be expected in the Belgian Congo, and on May 29, 1927, at Rutshuru in the Kivu district, a native brought me a male, freshly killed, from a grassy spot well away from water.  Its plumage was rather brownish as compared with some of the grayer specimens I have examined, especially on the sides of head and neck, and on the chest.  One of these gray specimens, in the Museum of Comparative Zo&ouml;logy, from Sakbayeme, Cameroon, was sexed as female.</p>
				<p>In 1933 and 1934, Brother Joseph Hutsebaut sent four skins of <taxonName idx_name="Porzana marginalis">P. marginalis</taxonName> from Buta, Lower Uelle, to the Congo Museum.  One was
<pb n="9" id="t000120-p00015c.tif"/> brownish, stated to be male; and one of the grayish birds was labeled as a female.  One might rather have expected the grayer specimens to be males, if the difference were sexual.  The brownish examples do not seem to be young, whereas one of Brother Hutsebaut&apos;s gray specimens has plumage suggesting immaturity.  Near Elisabethville on December 20, 1933, De Riemaecker obtained an adult in grayish plumage which he also sexed as a female.  Wings of six Congo specimens measure 103&ndash;112 mm., tails, 47&ndash;49, exposed culmen, 16&ndash;18, metatarsus, 32&ndash;36, middle toe with claw, 45&ndash;49.</p>
				<p>The species may be expected to occur in many other savanna regions of the Congo, particularly the Kasai, and possibly also the Lower Congo.  Eggs in the Nehrkorn and other collections from Lake Nyasa and Southwest Africa, attributed to this elusive species, are believed by Sch&ouml;nwetter<note n="1">1928, Beitr. Fortpfl.-biol.

				<p>SPECIMENS.&mdash;Stanleyville, &female;, Aug. 11.  Avakubi, &male;, Dec. 13; &female;, Jan. 31; &female; juv., Dec. 9.  Pawa, &female;, &male; juv., July 12.

				<p>ADULTS.&mdash;Iris orange-red, rim of eyelids red; bill light yellowish green; feet dull red, with dusky brownish claws.</p>
				<p>Adult males, as a rule, are noticeably larger than females.  The exposed culmen measures 24.5&ndash;27 mm. in seven males from the Belgian Congo, and 19.6&ndash;24.7 mm. in eleven females.  Wings of seven males from the same country 100&ndash;111 mm., and of eleven females 96&ndash;106 mm.  W. W. Bowen measured a series of 88 skins from the entire range of the species and found the wings varying from 96 to 115 mm. (both sexes), but not in such a way as to indicate any valid geographic races.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;All Africa, from the Senegal River, Bahr-el-Ghazal, and Abyssinia southward to the Cape.  Generally distributed through-out the Congo, but less common in heavily wooded districts.  In the Kivu region it is found abundantly on lakes as high as 6700 feet above the sea.</p>
				<p>The black crake is usually much more common than it appears, skulking in the long grass, unless the forest comes right down to the water&apos;s edge.  When it does venture out into the open by day or goes walking jacana-like over floating vegetation, it scoots to cover at the first sign of danger, and can seldom be made to take wing.  In the papyrus swamps near Faradje, when standing in waitf or shy reed-warblers, I frequently watched pairs or small family parties of <taxonName>Limnocorax</taxonName> wending their way through their favorite haunts, or as evening came on, climbing up inclined stalks of papyrus, probably to spend the night on a perch a couple of yards above the water.</p>
				<p>Besides low &quot;chucks&quot; uttered from time to time while walking about, this crake has a characteristic call, which sounds as though several birds gave it in unison.  Perhaps they do, for they are seldom single.  These notes begin with low but excited clucking or chattering sounds, and then follows a resonant &quot;k-k-r-rung&quot; that is almost bullfrog-like.  This is the most characteristic part of the performance, and may be repeated two or three times.  From this, no doubt, came the Mangbetu name for the bird: &quot;Nekipworondo.&quot;  Occasionally when wicker fish-traps with a conical entrance are lying on the shore, these birds will make their way inside and find themselves unable to get out.</p>
				<p>I have never found the nest, but it is known to be built of dry rushes in tussocks or bushes close to the water.<note n="1">See Reichenow, 1900, `V&ouml;g. Afr.,' I. p. 281; Sclater, 1906, `Birds S. Afr.,' IV, p. 261; Granvik, 1923, J. f. O., Sonderheft, p. 41; Lynes, 1925, Ibis, p. 572; and Pitman, 1929, Ool. Rec., IX, pp. 37&ndash;41, 1 photograph.</note> The eggs, numbering from
<pb n="11" id="t000120-p00017c.tif"/> two to five, are yellowish white or buffy, speckled throughout, and more thickly spotted with brown at the larger end.  They measure 29.5&ndash;36 mm. X 22&ndash;25.5.</p>
				<p>The breeding-season, in the northeastern Congo, does not seem to be very clearly defined, since birds with enlarged reproductive organs were collected in March, July, August, November, and December. The young are at first clothed in black down; then they assume a gray juvenal plumage, much lighter than that of the adult, and even whitish on the throat.  At this stage the iris is dark greenish gray, and the bill bears a curious color pattern, being black with whitish tip, and a pink area above and behind each nostril.</p>
				<p>The sequence of plumages, therefore, as well as the coloration of the adult, is suggestive of the gallinules.  The adult male taken at Niangara, December 6, was molting all its remiges at once, as well as the alula-quills and most of the rectrices.<note n="1">C. H. B. Grant, 1915, Ibis, p. 46, describes an adult female from East Africa in a similar molt.</note>  Such a molt is probably normal in this species, though certainly not in most genera of rails.</p>
				<p>FOOD.&mdash;Only five stomachs were examined: one contained finely-divided insect-remains and small stones; two, insects, small seeds, and bits of stone; the remaining two, only small seeds.  According to Heuglin,<note n="2">1873, `Orn. Nordost-Afr.,' p. 1239.</note> their diet includes small fish, spawn, snails, larv&aelig;, insects, worms, duckweed, and seeds of aquatic plants.</p>

				<p>ADULTS.&mdash;Iris orange-red to bright scarlet; rim of eyelids red; bill purplish red at base, outer portion gray, with culmen dusky; feet brown.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;From the Gambia and the southern Sudan south to Damaraland and Natal; rare or absent in heavily forested regions and on the higher mountains.</p>
				<p>In so far as my personal observation goes, this is very much of a land-crake, found in grassy situations often far from water, and difficult to flush.  It did not seem numerous anywhere in the northeastern Congo.  One which had been seen to enter a patch of grass and weeds on the edge of the village at Ngayu was surrounded by our native workers, and took wing only as a last resort, when the men were so close that one of them knocked it down and caught it.  It had eaten insects and many tiny snails.  At Garamba one was taken in a wetter situation, a grassy marsh.</p>
				<p>Near Boma, on January 7, another was put up from some long grass in a dry hollow, and flew rapidly away.  It was a female, and in the oviduct was found a broken whitish egg, spotted with rufous, very heavily marked at one end.  About Luluabourg, in the Kasai district, this crake must be common, for Father Callewaert sent us ten skins, including one of a bird in juvenal dress taken on May 7.  Conover and Zimmer also collected this species at Katobwe on the Lualaba River.</p>
				<p>A nest found by Paget-Wilkes<note n="1">1929, Ool. Rec., IX. pp. 11, 12.</note> in the Trans-Nzoia District of Kenya Colony on June 26, was made of bents and grasses, in a depression in the ground amid tall grass, not far from a small stream.  The set of eggs numbered five.  Shuel<note n="2">1938, Ibis, p. 234.</note> in Northern Nigeria found several nests in July and August with seven eggs each.  These he described as light cream or dull white, with blotches and dots of reddish brown and lilac, 32&ndash;37 mm. &times; 22.5&ndash;26.</p>

				<p>SPECIMEN.&mdash;Niangara, &female;, Nov. 21.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;During the northern summer, Europe and northern and central Asia.  On the southern migration the corn-crake visits Arabia and a large part of Africa, especially in the east, reaching South Africa, but rare in the Cape Province.  Though known from South Africa mainly during the southern summer, from December to March, it has sometimes been suspected of breeding there too.<note n="1">Sclater, 1906, `Birds S.

				</p>
				<p>In the Congo it is not a common visitor, but is recorded from the northern border of the forest, as well as the eastern and southern grasslands. Father Callewaert has taken two examples for us at Luluabourg in December, and Rockefeller and Murphy obtained one at Lubenga in the Marungu district on March 11.  Besides our specimen captured by natives near Niangara, I flushed one there myself in April, 1913, in a field of grass.  It went off with labored flight, dropped back into the grass, and could not be found again.</p>
				<p>The two specimens reported from the vicinity of Kanda-Kanda by Father Vanderyst were captured by natives, and bore bands affixed at Helgoland and in Sweden.  Grote<note n="2">1931, Mitt. Zool.

				<p>The species of <taxonName>Sarothrura</taxonName> differ markedly in the relative length of the feet, so that this character is of great value in" identifying females and young.  Arranged in order of proportional length of metatarsus to wing, they stand approximately as follows: lineata 25 %, b&ouml;hmi 26 %, insularis 29%, elegans 29%, lugens 30%, rufa 31%, pulchra 40%.  The lastnamed species is thus the longest-legged; and <taxon><taxonName>Sarothrura watersi</taxonName> (Bartlett)</taxon> of Madagascar, for which Salomonsen has proposed a monotypic genus, <taxonName>Lemurolimnas</taxonName>, has the metatarsus only 34% as long as the wing.</p>

				<p>ADULT MALE.&mdash;Iris brown; bill brown, lighter on mandible; feet greenish brown.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;From the coast of French Guinea to the Upper Uelle, Kenya Colony, and Nyasaland.  The existence of a dark race, <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Sarothrura b&ouml;hmi danei">S. b. danei</taxonName> Bannerman</taxon>,<note n="1">1920, B. B. O. C., XLI, p. 3 (off coast of French Guinea).</note> in Upper Guinea is proved by a single specimen captured on shipboard.  <taxonName idx_name="Sarothrura b&ouml;hmi b&ouml;hmi">S. b. b&ouml;hmi</taxonName> is now known to range westward at least to southern Cameroon, occurring at Bitye, in a forest clearing, and eastward to Matchakos, Kenya Colony, whence came the female described as <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Sarothrura somereni">S. somereni</taxonName> Bannerman</taxon>.<note n="2">1919, B. B. O. C., XL, pp. 8, 28.</note>
				</p>
				<p>I have compared the type from the Katanga with males from the Uelle and Nairobi, and I am convinced that <taxonName idx_name="Sarothrura somereni">somereni</taxonName> is not a valid race. The adult female plumage seems to be known only from the type of <taxonName idx_name="Sarothrura somereni">somereni</taxonName>.  Dimensions of four adult males: wing, 83&ndash;86 mm.; tail, 30&ndash;35; metatarsus, 22&ndash;23.</p>
				<p>Our first specimen was an adult male, which I flushed at Faradje in 1911 on the edge of an open marsh, where the grass was only waist-high. Its flight was strong and direct, perhaps not so rapid as that of a quail. No doubt this species is quite as apt to skulk as most of the others, for B&ouml;hm noted that &quot;it allowed itself to be caught with the hand.&quot;  Our young bird from Medje was secured through natives.  A possible specialization in feeding habits was suggested by the stomach contents of the adult bird, small seeds exclusively.</p>

But in view of his remarks on the call of the bird&mdash;plainly that of S. elegans&mdash; the" identification would seem to be erroneous.<note n="1">According to Jackson and Sclater, 1938, `Birds of Kenya and Uganda,' I, p. 297, the eggs were those of S. lineata antonii.</note>

				<p>SPECIMENS.&mdash;Faradje, 3 &male;, Feb. 17, 23, Apr. 19; &female;, Feb. 22.</p>
				<p>The adult male is here described for the first time, since B&ouml;hm&apos;s type was a female, and the specimen which Matschie<note n="2">1887, J. f. O., p. 145.</note> took to be the male of <taxonName idx_name="Sarothrura lugens">lugens</taxonName> proved to be <taxonName idx_name="Sarothrura b&ouml;hmi">S. b&ouml;hmi</taxonName>.</p>
				<p>ADULT MALE.&mdash;The rich rufous coloration of crown, malar region, cheeks, and hind-neck does not extend across the front of the neck or throat.  Back black, finely streaked with white, two lines on each feather; on the black tail these markings become broken into spots.  The smallest wing-coverts (marginals) are largely whitish, but the remainder have the color of the back.  Primaries dark brown, outermost primary and alula-quills edged with white; under wing-coverts dark brownish gray. Throat whitish, feathers of upper breast black, with a broad white streak at each side; lower down, the tips become white as well, and the pattern becomes more lunulate.  Middle of the underparts mottled with gray and white; under tail-coverts blackish, lightly streaked with white.  Iris dark grayish brown; bill dusky brown, with lower side of mandible whitish; feet very dark brown.</p>
				<p>Measurements of two adult males from Faradje: wing, 78, 81 mm.; tail, 47, 53; exposed culmen, 12.5, 12.5; metatarsus, 23.5, 24; middle toe with claw, 28.5, 28.5.</p>
				<p>Our single adult female shows the following dimensions: wing, 82 mm.; tail, 52; culmen, 13; metatarsus, 24.5; middle toe with claw, 30.5.</p>
				<p>The female specimen has been compared with B&ouml;hm&apos;s type in the Berlin Museum, no difference being found which might even be regarded as subspecific.  The rufous ground-color of crown and cheeks is not quite so deep in the type specimen. Both birds have the spotting on the back white.  The spotted rufous-brown hood of the female is its most distinctive marking; and the narrow elevated culmen, rising as it approaches the forehead, is another good character in both sexes.  The male cannot be confused with any other species of <taxonName>Sarothrura</taxonName>, not even with <taxonName idx_name="Sarothrura lynesi lineata">S. l. lineata</taxonName> of South Africa, for it has the tail black, instead of rufous.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;Known only from the region of the Ugalla River, the neighborhood of Faradje in the Upper Uelle district, and the Bih&eacute; Province of Angola.  It will certainly be found to inhabit some of the intervening territory, probably along the western side of Lake Victoria or the eastern Congo border.  The occurrence in Angola is proved by a spirit specimen from Chitau, 70 miles north of Silva Porta, collected by
<pb n="17" id="t000120-p00023c.tif"/> Rudyerd Boulton in August, 1925.  It is in adult male plumage and has lost only its remiges and its tail.</p>
				<p>In the open savanna country about Faradje, papyrus swamps are numerous and extensive, but <taxonName>Sarothrura lugens</taxonName> was found rather in the grass-grown marshes, where the mud was not so deep.  The densely packed vegetation, largely grasses and marantaccous plants, is anywhere from waist to shoulder-high.  The birds' ways are secretive and typically ralline, our specimens being trapped, not shot, for when they flew up it was always unexpected, and they went but a short distance before dropping back out of sight.  Thereafter they refused to take wing again.  No calls were ever" identified with certainty.  Only one stomach was examined.  It contained finely divided insect-remains and two hard seeds.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;More or less locally from Sierra Leone, Cameroon, the Uelle district, Uganda, Nairobi, and Usambara, south to eastern Cape Province.</p>
				<p>Four races have been admitted by Sclater,<note n="1">1924, `Syst. Av. &AElig;th.,' pt. 1, pp. 104, 105.</note> but one of them, <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Sarothrura rufa ansorgei">S. r. ansorgei</taxonName> van Someren</taxon>, is probably not valid.  Specimens from Upper Guinea, Cameroon, and Gaboon are smaller than those from other regions of Africa.</p>
				<p>The males of the different races of <taxonName>Sarothrura rufa</taxonName> show few differences in coloration, and even in the same region there is often so much variation with regard to the rufous tone of the neck, or the extent of white streaking, that the more specimens one examines the less distinct do the races seem.<note n="2">I cannot however agree with the conclusions of M.-Praed and Grant, 1937, Ibis, p. 629.</note> The white streaking of the upperparts is broadest in males of <taxonName idx_name="Sarothrura rufa bonapartii">S. r. bonapartii</taxonName>, ranging from the Gaboon and Cameroon to Sierra Leone; and in males from north of the equatorial forest, perhaps also from Gaboon, there is apt to be more whitish in the mid-line of the breast.</p>
				<p>In the females, however, the color characters are better marked; and it is <taxonName idx_name="Sarothrura rufa bonapartii">bonapartii</taxonName> which has the lightest coloration.  Instead of small broken bars and spots on the back, there are wide crescentic marks of ochreous-brown or rufous-buff; and the wing-coverts are likewise more broadly barred or mottled with the lighter color.  The blackish ground-color
<pb n="18" id="t000120-p00024c.tif"/> is much restricted, but the tail is still dusky, with numerous brown markings on its coverts.  Throat and middle of breast are ochreous-white, with blackish spots at the sides of the chest, but none in the middle Flanks of a richer buff, barred with dusky.<note n="1">Description from adult females in Carnegie Museum, from Lolodorf, Cameroon.</note>
				</p>
				<p>The female of <taxonName idx_name="Sarothrura rufa rufa">S. r. rufa</taxonName> of South Africa is much darker, with finer light markings on the back.  <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Sarothrura rufa ansorgei">S. r. ansorgei</taxonName> van Someren</taxon<note n="2">1919, B. B. O. C., XL, p. 20 (Duque de Braganza).</note> of Angola was described as still more finely marked with buff above in the female, the wings less spotted, and the tail uniform black.  I have examined the two females on which this form was based, and feel that the lack of buff markings on the wings, and also perhaps on the tail-coverts, is simply a sign of immaturity.  Our female from Luluabourg in the southern Congo is generously spotted with buff on the back, and barred on many of the wing-coverts.  I have also examined three females from Angola that are brown-spotted on the back.</p>
				<p>Somewhat intermediate in color between typical <taxonName idx_name="Sarothrura rufa rufa">rufa</taxonName> and <taxonName idx_name="Sarothrura rufa bonapartii">bonapartii</taxonName> is <taxonName idx_name="Sarothrura rufa elizabeth&aelig;">S. r. elizabeth&aelig;</taxonName> of the region northeast and north of Lake Victoria. This is best illustrated in females.  It is to this subspecies that I refer our specimens from the northeastern Congo, after comparison with those collected by Heller at Kaimosi, Kenya Colony, for the U. S. National Museum.  There is a general agreement in color between the females, but the Congo specimens are smaller, showing an approach to <taxonName idx_name="Sarothrura rufa bonapartii">bonapartii</taxonName>.</p>
				<p>The equatorial forest belt is a partial barrier only in the separation of the races, for <taxonName idx_name="Sarothrura rufa bonapartii">bonapartii</taxonName> extends across it from the Cameroon to the Gaboon.  The pair of birds from which this race was described is preserved in the Paris Museum.  The wing of the male measures only 66 mm., that of the female 69.  Possibly this form reaches the western Belgian Congo.</p>
				<p><taxonName idx_name="Sarothrura rufa rufa">S. r. rufa</taxonName> appears to range northward from the Cape Province to Usambara, the Kivu district, and the Kasai.  Three specimens here referred to <taxonName idx_name="Sarothrura rufa rufa">S. r. rufa</taxonName> were obtained by Father Callewaert at Luluabourg: a male assuming adult plumage (wing, 77 mm.), an adult female (wing, 80 mm.), and a young bird with remiges not yet full-grown.  This young individual, taken on August 23, indicates that eggs are laid in the early part of the dry season; but the male bird, captured on May 11, and perhaps three or four months old, may show that a breeding season is not well defined.  An adult male with wing 78 mm. long has also been received by the Congo Museum from Kashusha near Costermansville, in the neighborhood of Lake Kivu.</p>

				<p>ADULTS OF BOTH SEXES.&mdash;Iris dark brown; upper part of maxilla dusky, rest of bill light blue; feet dark grayish brown.</p>
				<p>Males from Pawa have wings only 71&ndash;74 mm., and females from that locality, 69.5, 74.  The female from Faradje has the wing 76 mm. long, and thus approaches the measurements of Uganda and Kavirondo birds more closely.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;From Nairobi to Kakamega in Kenya Colony and across Uganda to the northeastern Congo.  It is not at all unlikely that <taxonName idx_name="Sarothrura rufa elizabeth&aelig;">elizabeth&aelig;</taxonName> occurs also along the eastern Congo border in the vicinity of Lake Edward.</p>
				<p>The single specimen from Faradje was trapped by a native in a grassy marsh.  Those collected in the northern Ituri were secured in July in the quaking bogs near Pawa, at the northern edge of the forest.</p>
				<p>The Mabudu people showed me how to capture these little rails, much as they hunt rats in the grass.  Scattering about in the marsh, they would listen for the quarry.  From time to time the rails are accustomed to utter a feeble &quot;t-w&ibreve;, t-w&ibreve;, t-w&ibreve;&hellip;&quot; lasting but a few seconds, and often accompanied by a low grunting sound.  The whole party, men, women, and children, to the number of about eighty, would next surround the spot from which one seemed to call; and gradually the circle closed in, the vegetation being carefully searched with the hands.  Sometimes the bird took flight, but its pursuers ran at once to the spot where it realighted, and proceeded again in the same manner.  This time it would probably elect to hide, and would be caught in the hand.  Four were thus secured, and two more shot.<note n="1">As Mr. Bates himself has pointed out (1909, Ibis, p. 7), his early notes (1907, Ibis, p. 421), under the heading <taxonName>Sarothrura bonapartei</taxonName>, really applied in part to <taxonName idx_name="Sarothrura elegans reichenovi">S. elegans reichenovi</taxonName>, and possibly in the matter of voice&mdash;I think&mdash;to <taxonName idx_name="Sarothrura pulchra">S. pulchra</taxonName>.</note>
				</p>
				<p>Of the four stomachs examined, three contained insect-remains mixed with small seeds, a fourth having small seeds only.</p>
				<p>The state of the reproductive organs indicated that at this date, July 12, they were ready to breed, if not already nesting.  In the case of <taxonName idx_name="Sarothrura rufa bonapartii">S. r. bonapartii</taxonName>, living in approximately the same latitude, farther west, the breeding season begins a little earlier, for two specimens in the Carnegie Museum, taken on May 14, are in juvenal plumage with the wing-quills not quite fully grown.</p>
				<p>From Djaposten, Cameroon, Mr. H. C. Raven has brought me a
<pb n="20" id="t000120-p00026c.tif"/> newly hatched <taxonName>Sarothrura</taxonName> chick, clothed in black down.  Its middle toe is so much longer than its metatarsus that it is certainly <taxonName idx_name="Sarothrura rufa bonapartii">S. r. bonapartii</taxonName>. This chick was taken from a nest made of grasses in a clearing, amid grass about waist-high on dry ground.  In the same nest was one addled white egg, measuring 26.4 &times; 19.5 mm.

				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;From Sierra Leone, the northern Congo, and northern Somaliland, southward in the west probably to Angola, and in the east to Natal and Knysna in Cape Province.  Known from relatively few localities.  We are scarcely justified in recognizing more than three races:</p>
				<p><taxon><taxonName idx_name="Sarothrura elegans elegans">S. e. elegans</taxonName> (Smith)</taxon>, recorded from the southeast coast of Africa, Knysna to Natal, and Nyasaland, possibly extending north to the Uluguru Mountains and even to Mount Kenya.</p>
				<p><taxonName idx_name="Sarothrura elegans reichenovi">S. e. reichenovi</taxonName>, occupying the forested Cameroon, Congo, Uganda, and the region south of Mount Elgon.  It certainly extends southward to Stanley Pool and Lukolela on the Congo River, and may be expected to reach Angola.  There is an adult male in the Congo Museum from Kilo; and in the Rothschild Collection a female from Ishangi on the south shore of Lake Kivu.  It must certainly occur in the Gaboon, as it is reported from the Mayombe; and it is to be looked for in the Kasai district.  Some form, probably <taxonName idx_name="Sarothrura elegans reichenovi">reichenovi</taxonName>, occupies Upper Guinea, for at
<pb n="21" id="t000120-p00027c.tif"/> several places in Sierra Leone and southern French Guinea Bates<note n="1">1931, Ibis, p. 672.  See also Bannerman, 1935, B. B. O. C., LV, p. 17.</note> heard the unmistakable call of the species.</p>
				<p>At best, <taxonName idx_name="Sarothrura elegans reichenovi">reichenovi</taxonName> is scarcely distinguishable from the typical race. I cannot see any constant difference between males, and doubt whether the female of <taxonName idx_name="Sarothrura elegans reichenovi">reichenovi</taxonName> is darker, more heavily barred on the underparts as has been claimed.</p>
				<p>Measurements of six adult males of <taxonName idx_name="Sarothrura elegans reichenovi">reichenovi</taxonName> from the Ituri district and one from southern Cameroon: wing, 83&ndash;89 mm.; tail, 32.5&ndash;36; exposed culmen, 13.5&ndash;14.5; metatarsus, 25&ndash;27; middle toe with claw, 26.5&ndash;28.5.</p>
				<p>Four adult females from Lolodorf, Cameroon (Carnegie Museum): wing, 84&ndash;89 mm.; tail, 34&ndash;36; culmen, 12.5&ndash;14; metatarsus, 24&ndash;26; middle toe with claw, 26.5&ndash; 27.5.</p>
				<p>I have examined the type of <taxonName idx_name="Sarothrura elegans loringi">S. e. loringi</taxonName> Mearns from Mt. Kenya, which I think" identical with <taxonName idx_name="Sarothrura elegans">S. e. elegans</taxonName>; and I doubt the validity of <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Sarothrura elegans languens">S. e. languens</taxonName> Friedmann</taxon> from Uluguru.</p>
				<p><taxon><taxonName idx_name="Sarothrura elegans buryi">Sarothrura e. buryi</taxonName> O.-Grant</taxon>, of which only the female type is known seems much more whitish below than any other I have examined.  It is surprising that any representative of the species should occur in northern Somaliland.</p>
				<p>In West and Central Africa <taxonName>Sarothrura elegans</taxonName> is a common inhabitant of second growth and the border regions of the forest.  Unlike other members of the genus, it exhibits marked nocturnal activity.  My acquaintance with it was gained only after long search for the author of a weird note, most often heard at night, which I began in April, 1910, in the Mabudu country near the Nepoko River.</p>
				<p>During a large part of the year one may hear this unobtrusive call&mdash; low, prolonged, and, to our ear, mournful&mdash;issuing from the dense vegetation near the village clearings.  It might be called a low wailing, with almost the clarity of a tuning fork, and offering no measure of distance. Starting faintly, it swells in volume without change of pitch, and then ceases abruptly after three or four seconds.  Often it is repeated persistently, with intervals of silence lasting six or eight seconds, and in the stillness of night is audible at 300 yards.  The sound becomes commonplace, and natives attribute it a variety of creatures, even chameleons or a large skink, though many of them do know it is made by a small bird. Native names for the bird are &quot;Ne-i&quot; (Medje), &quot;Nebebu&quot; (Mangbetu), &quot;Njunju&quot; (Mabudu).</p>
				<p>Finally, at Badonde, in July, 1913, I had a party of natives surround one that was calling at daybreak in a neglected banana grove.  It did
<pb n="22" id="t000120-p00028c.tif"/> not take wing, and was caught in the hand.  Subsequent experience showed that this crake lives on high ground, away from water, seldom in virgin forest, and not in open grassy fields.  Thickets on old cleared land are preferred.  Near Avakubi, by the same method, we caught two more males; and at Lukolela my natives brought me two in 1930.  One of these I kept alive for three days, but the only noise it made was a low growl, audible within a few yards.</p>
				<p>Females are evidently silent, and in the northern Ituri males call most frequently from March to September.  At Lukolela the dates are, of course, reversed: September 11 to March 13, so one may say the calling starts with the rains, and continues about six months.  When heard during daytime, the sound seems weak, and it appears that the esophagus can be distended with air so as to increase the resonance, much as in the pectoral sandpiper, the prairie chicken, and a number of other birds.<note n="1">See also the account by Astley Maberly, 1935, Ostrich, VI, pp. 39&ndash;42.</note>
				</p>
				<p>Nesting may be delayed till the latter part of the season of calling. In late September, 1926, near Irumu (Ituri district), we discovered a nest on the ground in a patch of woods, with three white eggs.  When shown to me by my black companion, the nest was not roofed over.  A cautious approach at night with a flashlight enabled me to catch the incubating female.  One of her eggs measures 26 &times; 20.2 mm.  In southern Cameroon Bates<note n="2">1927, Ibis, p. 12.</note> reported the finding of two nests in September and October, one with three eggs, the other with four, 26&ndash;28 mm. &times; 20&ndash;21.5.</p>
				<p>In six stomachs of Reichenow&apos;s pigmy-crake I have found insects most commonly, including termites and a small roach.  Small snails were noted in three stomachs, tiny pebbles also being swallowed, but seeds only once.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;Western and central forest-region of equatorial Africa, from the Gambia to the Kavirondo district, and south to northern Angola.  <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Sarothrura pulchra pulchra">S. p. pulchra</taxonName> (Gray)</taxon> ranges from the Gambia to southern Nigeria.  <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Sarothrura pulchra tibatiensis">S. p. tibatiensis</taxonName> Bannerman</taxon> occupies the highlands of northern Cameroon, and may extend to the eastward.  <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Sarothrura pulchra zenkeri">S. p. zenkeri</taxonName> Neumann</taxon> is restricted to the coastlands of southern Cameroon and perhaps of the Gaboon, but a male from the Portuguese Congo in the Paris Museum is nearer <taxonName idx_name="Sarothrura pulchra centralis">centralis</taxonName> than <taxonName idx_name="Sarothrura pulchra zenkeri">zenkeri</taxonName>.</p>
				<p><taxonName>Sarothrura pulchra centralis</taxonName> ranges from the Lower Congo and Bitye in Cameroon, east to Doruma in the northern Uelle, Lake Albert, Nandi in Kenya Colony, Bukoba, the Lualaba River, the Kasai district, and Ndala Tando in northern Angola.  There is a male from Lokandu on the Lualaba in the collection of Mr. J.H. Fleming of Toronto.  From Luluabourg Father Callewaert has sent us eight males and two females.</p>
				<p>In this subspecies the tail of the female usually shows distinct broad bars of black, as was the case in seven specimens out of nine from the Uelle and Ituri districts.  This black tail-barring is wider in the same sex of <taxonName idx_name="Sarothrura pulchra zenkeri">zenkeri</taxonName>, and the back is more narrowly banded with ochraceous. Males of <taxonName idx_name="Sarothrura pulchra zenkeri">zenkeri</taxonName> have smaller white spots on the back than those of <taxonName idx_name="Sarothrura pulchra centralis">centralis</taxonName>.</p>
				<p><taxonName idx_name="Sarothrura pulchra pulchra">S. p. pulchra</taxonName> has small spots on the back in the male, but is less deeply colored than <taxonName idx_name="Sarothrura pulchra zenkeri">zenkeri</taxonName>, the female with tail faintly barred, if at all.
<pb n="24" id="t000120-p00030c.tif"/> <taxonName idx_name="Sarothrura pulchra tibatiensis">S. p. tibatiensis</taxonName> is rather like typical <taxonName idx_name="Sarothrura pulchra pulchra">pulchra</taxonName>, but larger, the wing of males attaining 91.5 mm.  <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Sarothrura pulchra batesi">S. p. batesi</taxonName> Bannerman</taxon><note n="1">1922, B. B. O. C., XLIII, p. 7 (Bitye, S. Cameroon).</note> has less title to recognition, being roughly intermediate between <taxonName idx_name="Sarothrura pulchra zenkeri">zenkeri</taxonName> and <taxonName idx_name="Sarothrura pulchra centralis">centralis</taxonName>, so that I prefer to unite it with the latter.</p>
				<p>Measurements of <taxonName idx_name="Sarothrura pulchra centralis">centralis</taxonName> from the northeastern Congo&mdash;10 males: wing, 76&ndash;85 mm.; tail, 38.5&ndash;45.5; exposed culmen, 14&ndash;16.5; metatarsus, 31&ndash;34; middle toe with claw, 30.5&ndash;34.5.  8 females: wing, 79&ndash;85 mm.; tail, 36.5&ndash;44.5; exposed culmen, 14.5&ndash;16; metatarsus, 30.5&ndash;34.5; middle toe with claw, 31&ndash;34.</p>
				<p><taxonName>Sarothrura pulchra</taxonName> is probably the commonest species in collections because&mdash;I suspect&mdash;of its voice.  It is one of the two spotted species characteristic of wooded places, even outside the main body of the equatorial forest.  Found along the wooded banks of brooks and swamps, it betrays its presence during the day by a cherry call, not very loud, but repeated almost incessantly.  The notes have something faintly belllike, and a slight break comes after every three or four syllables. &quot;Goong-goong-goong-goong, goong-goong-goong-goong,&quot;  Until I had seen the bird call, I could scarcely believe that a rail was the author.</p>
				<p>The bird&apos;s range extends out along wooded river-bottoms to the borders of the Sudan, and in the northeastern Uelle it is also to be heard in papyrus swamps.  On the eastern Congo frontier it ascends to 5300 feet in the highlands, even a few miles east of Rutshuru.  Though extending southward over the whole Kasai district, it does not reach the Upper Katanga.</p>
				<p>If one sits quietly and patiently along a brook where the bird has been calling, it is fairly sure to reappear, walking along the bank or jumping from stone to stone.  Besides the more pleasant call, which has given rise to the Mangbetu name of the bird, &quot;Nung-gung-gu,&quot; there is another shriller &quot;kik-kik-kik&hellip;,&quot; emitted rapidly and more rail-like in quality. The species calls throughout the year.</p>
				<p>Examination of seven stomachs showed that insects formed the greater part of their food, but small snails had been eaten in three cases, small frog-bones were found twice, and earthworms once.  No seeds were noted.</p>
				<p>It was my good fortune to find two nests of <taxonName idx_name="Sarothrura pulchra centralis">S. p. centralis</taxonName> near Faradje. On April 27, 1911, in a damp bit of gallery-forest, a small dark bird darted out from under my feet.  Its nest was a small oval mound, not quite four inches high, nine inches long.  Covered with dead leaves exactly like those around it, it could be entered only through a horizontal
<pb n="25" id="t000120-p00031c.tif"/> slit kept closed by the weight of the roof until actually raised by the bird. Dry plant-stems as well as dry leaves formed its interior.  Setting a snare, we were able to catch the female when she came back to her pure-white eggs, two in number.  They measured 30.3 &times; 21.9 and 30.9 &times; 22.1 mm.</p>
				<p>The second nest was found in like manner on May 7, 1911, near a pool of stagnant water in swampy woods, and was an almost exact counterpart of the first.  This time the male was incubating two eggs just about to hatch, and he was caught with a butterfly net.  The downy black young hatched soon afterward.  From this evidence and that obtained by dissections, I conclude that the breeding season falls in the first half of the rainy season, though directly on the equator there is probably no complete regularity.</p>

				<p>The genus <taxonName>Himantornis</taxonName> has no very close ally.  While its feet resemble those of <taxonName>Gymnocrex rosenbergi</taxonName> of Celebes, and both these rails have but eight rectrices, <taxonName>Himantornis</taxonName> differs from <taxonName>Gymnocrex</taxonName> in having no aftershaft, no tuft on the oil-gland, and a eutaxic wing.<note n="1">First noticed by Bates, 1911, Ibis, p. 483.</note> The natal down of <taxonName>Himantornis</taxonName> is unlike that of most rails, and not blackish.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;West and central Africa, from Liberia to Cameroon, Mayombe forest in Lower Congo, and eastward to the Ituri and Manyema districts.</p>
				<p>The few specimens I have seen from Upper Guinea do not differ perceptibly from those of the Cameroon, and similar plain-colored birds have been taken in the Lower Uelle district: at the Likandi River (British Museum), Koloka (Frankfort Museum), Buta, and Bambili (Congo Museum).  <taxonName idx_name="Himantornis h&aelig;matopus h&aelig;matopus">H. h. h&aelig;matopus</taxonName> may therefore be said to range from Liberia to the northern Belgian Congo.

				<p><taxonName idx_name="Himantornis h&aelig;matopus whitesidei">H. h. whitesidei</taxonName>, of the south-central and eastern Congo forests, is richly colored, with more warm brown above, and the breast-feathers often bear a median spot of black.

				<p>The female type is preserved in the Paris Museum and shows some approach to <taxonName idx_name="Himantornis h&aelig;matopus petiti">whitesidei</taxonName>, especially in the color of the upperparts.  The breast-feathers are conspicuously margined with gray, but lack dark centers until the lower breast and flanks are reached.

				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;Forested districts from the southern Gaboon to the Lower Congo.  A male taken by Aschemeier at Oguma in the Fernand Vaz district (U. S.

				<p>ADULT MALE.&mdash;Iris light reddish brown or reddish orange, eyelids and lores blackish; maxilla black, mandible light blue, with blackish tip; feet light crimson, claws gray.</p>
				<p>ADULT FEMALE.&mdash;Iris dull red, brownish orange, or reddish orange; base of mandible sometimes grayish green; feet rose-red.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;From the vicinity of Lukolela eastward to the Semliki Valley and the Manyema district, and northward to the Bomokandi River at Poko.  The southern limit is near the Sankuru River, along the southern margin of the equatorial forest.</p>
				<p>Two adults, male and female, from Lukolela are black-spotted on the breast, like the type in the British Museum and several of our specimens from the Ituri, as well as others I have seen from Kitutu, Manyema district, and Inkongo on the Sankuru River.  Some of the females from the Ituri lack this spotting.  Measurements of our series from the Ituri, four adult males and six adult females: wing, &male;, 220&ndash;232 mm., &female;, 200&ndash;225; tail, &male;, 84&ndash;93, &female;, 80&ndash;91; exposed culmen, &male;, 38.5, &female;, 38&ndash;39.5; metatarsus, &male;, 78.5&ndash;84.5, &female; 73&ndash;81.5; middle toe with claw, &male;, 49.5&ndash;55, &female;, 49&ndash;53.</p>
				<p>This large wood-rail is widely distributed throughout the Congo forests, yet of our dozen specimens only a single one was shot with the gun. Most of the others were trapped, save for the one young bird captured in the hand.  It seemed to be attracted with one of its parents by the glow of a lantern at night.  The old bird flew up into the trees and escaped.</p>
				<p>To trap these birds a little fence was built across tiny forest rivulets, leaving an opening in the middle, where a noose was arranged so as to catch the bird either by the leg or by the neck when the trap was sprung. A large rat (<taxonName>Malacomys longipes centralis</taxonName>), also fond of brooks, was frequently caught in the same traps.  The short toes of <taxonName>Himantornis</taxonName> are adapted to walking on fairly hard ground; it is primarily a bird of deep forests.  At Lukolela one was caught during the dry season in a deadfall set in forest seventy yards from the nearest spot where a small brook would flow during the rains.</p>
				<p>To this species the natives of the Ituri and Bomokandi attribute, no doubt correctly, a curious sound often heard in the forest at twilight. This is a rather low, gruff call of several syllables, repeated over and over again, without a pause, sometimes for several minutes, and audible for several hundred yards.</p>
				<p>According to the Medje people, the bird is saying &quot;j&uacute;-ur&uacute;kwandra, j&uacute;-ur&uacute;kwandra&hellip;&hellip;,&quot; meaning literally &quot;go away from my place.&quot; This advice is said to be addressed to the leopard, or to other birds, such as the guinea-fowl.  The performance has a peculiar rhythm, which native
<pb n="28" id="t000120-p00034c.tif"/> imagination associates with dancing, so that they often wag their heads from side to side when imitating the sound.<note n="1">See also Bates, 1907, Ibis, p. 421.</note>  This noise, said to be delivered from a perch, I have heard in the northern Ituri in the months of March, April, July, and September.</p>
				<p>At Lukolela on the middle Congo I heard <taxonName>Himantornis</taxonName> call in the evening only during late December.  There, the natives also put it into words: &quot;Nakatele akulu, nakakwela na nsusu,&quot; which mean, &quot;My feet became red, I married a chicken.&quot;  The story went that the rail once came out of the forest and mated with a chicken of a village.  The sun turned his feet red, and the hen cast him off.  Back again in the forest, his feet remain red, hence his repeated complaint.</p>
				<p>Though probably not an active bird through the day, it is said not to be strictly nocturnal either, but rather to feed in the morning and evening on the ground, roosting aloft at night.  One of our specimens was shot from a perch, ten feet up.</p>
				<p>Native names of such an interesting bird are worthy of mention; in the northeastern Congo, the Medje call it &quot;Nekudzakula&quot;; the Wabali, &quot;Kodo-kodo&quot;; and the Azande, &quot;Bwagido.&quot;  Along the middle Congo River, the Mpama know it as &quot;Unsasi&quot;; the Mobangi, &quot;Monsasi&quot;; and the Basengere, &quot;Bunsansu.&quot;</p>
				<p>The stomachs of nine adult birds were examined; in seven cases they contained varied insect-remains, including beetles; two had eaten only ants; one a small millipede; one had swallowed small snails of two kinds, as well as a small frog or toad.  All but two had a few small stones in the gizzard, and three had some hard seeds as well.</p>
				<p>A native near Medje, who brought me a specimen (March 17) killed with an arrow while on its nest, along with its three eggs, assured me that the nest had been placed in a tree.  There is no doubt as to the" identification of these eggs, so closely do they agree with one which I took from the oviduct of a female (February 13).  Their color is creamy white with scattered spots of red-brown that vary from small specks to fair-sized blotches.  The blotches are numerous toward the smaller end, and some are half concealed, showing as gray shell-markings.  Dimensions, 49&ndash;50.5 &times; 38.1&ndash;38.9 mm.</p>
				<p>The color of the natal down is most unusual.  In our youngest specimen, with juvenal plumage just beginning to sprout, the down is brownish white below, rather dull light brown above, with a well-marked dark pattern, consisting of a blackish-brown patch covering the whole crown, a stripe of the same color from lores to ears, and a broad median stripe
<pb n="29" id="t000120-p00035c.tif"/> of sepia on back and rump.  This chick has small sharp claws on both pollex and index4.  Iris very dark brownish; maxilla blackish, mandible gray; feet dull pink.</p>

				<p>SPECIMEN.&mdash;Stanleyville, &male; im. Aug. 16.</p>
				<p>Iris brownish-red; bill dull yellow, dusky on base of culmen; feet grayish-green. In the adult male the frontal shield becomes bright red.</p>
				<p>This example was not fully adult, for it retained a considerable amount of white on the middle of the underparts, and also whitish feathers on the throat.  Its wing measured 128 mm.  Adult males have wings 132&ndash;146 mm.</p>
				<p><taxon><taxonName>Gallinula pumila</taxonName> P. L. Sclater</taxon>, considered by Reichenow to be the young of <taxonName idx_name="Gallinula angulata">G. angulata</taxonName>, is as Bates <note n="1">1911, Ibis, p. 483.</note> believed, the adult female of <taxonName idx_name="Gallinula angulata">angulata</taxonName>.  The distinct brownish plumage of the female is exceptional for this genus.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;From Senegal, Darfur, and Sennar south to the Cape Province, and on the island of S&atilde;o Tom&eacute;.  In the Congo it seems to be nowhere a common bird.  Our single specimen from Stanleyville was procured for us by the natives, and none was ever seen alive by us in the Ituri or Uelle districts.</p>
				<p>The Congo Museum, however, now has specimens from Buta, Niangara, and Abimva in the Uelle district, as well as Barumbu on the upper Congo, Moba on Lake Tanganyika, Kabalo on the Lualaba, and Kando in the Upper Katanga.  In 1937 I obtained one myself at Angumu in the heart of the eastern Congo forest.  De Riemaecker has collected it at Elisabethville.  The species may also be expected in the Lower Congo, for it was taken at Landana by Lucan and Petit.</p>
				<p>The lesser moorhen breeds throughout its range, or at least in Darfur, Kenya Colony, and Damaraland.  The nest is of rushes or water grass, hidden in the wettest part of a marsh, and usually contains four eggs, yellowish white or very pale brown, with gray shell-markings and spots
<pb n="30" id="t000120-p00036c.tif"/> of rufous-brown, most numerous about the large end.  Dimensions, 33.5 &times; 24 mm.  The rainy season seems to be preferred for nesting, though van Someren found eggs near Nairobi, Kenya Colony, in June.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;From Europe, southern Asia, and North America to northern Argentine, Cape Province, Madagascar, the Seychelles, Celebes, Guam, and the Hawaiian Islands.  The African race, <taxonName idx_name="Gallinula chloropus meridionalis">meridionalis</taxonName>, ranges from South Africa north to Abyssinia and the southern border of the Sudan, as well as the islands of S&atilde;o Tom&eacute; and Annobon. But it is wanting in all the forest region of western Africa and the Congo.</p>
				<p>There are specimens from the Katanga, Baraka on Lake Tanganyika, and Ruhengere in Ruanda.  Count Gyldenstolpe took two on the lakes of British Ruanda, where they are abundant, and reported seeing others on Lakes Edward and Albert.  They may be expected on Lake Kivu. Mr. G. Babault showed me an example which he had collected on the Mokoto Lakes; and on Lake Bunyoni (6700 feet) I found them to be among the commonest water-birds, swimming between the lily-pads near the shores.  When excited they can step up on a patch of water-lilies and run off on top of them.  At Kabare on the south shore of Lake Edward I too saw a few moorhens, but I noticed none on Lake Albert.</p>
				<p>In nesting habits the African moorhen resembles the European race, and is said to lay from four to eight eggs.  These are creamy white to pinkish buff, spotted with rusty red and lead-blue, 39.1&ndash;45 mm. &times; 27.9&ndash; 32.5.<note n="1">Chubb, 1914, Ann. Durban Mus., I, p. 36; Belcher, 1930, `Birds of Nyasaland,' p. 69.</note> Nests have been found in the region of Damaraland from February to April, in Natal in June, and in Nyasaland during August.

				<p>ADULT MALE.&mdash;Iris scarlet; bill red, darker than eye, and browner above, frontal shield dark brown or dusky green; feet brownish red, becoming scarlet on front of tibi&aelig;.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;From the White Nile and Senegambia to Cape Province, also in Madagascar, Ascension, and other islands.  Will be found locally, depending upon suitable river banks and swamps, throughout the Congo.  Rodhain and Bequaert shot one near the village of Nkole, where the Luapula empties into Lake Moero.  Raven secured specimens at Kabwe and Kongolo on the Lualaba River.  Apparently absent, however, from the small highland lakes of the Kivu district.</p>
				<p>At Nzoro and Avakubi these small porphyrios were found haunting the fringe of grass along the river banks.  They were not numerous, and seen but rarely.  On one occasion, at sundown, a pair was found perched high in the stout grasses, where they evidently meant to spend the night. At Boma they were somewhat more common, in a large papyrus swamp. Like moorhens they can swim well, and I have even seen a wounded specimen dive.</p>

Four or five eggs are laid, dirty white to light reddish brown, with ashy or purplish shell-markings and reddish-brown spots, measuring 31.1&ndash;39.5 mm. by 22.9&ndash;27.</p>
				<p>Of three stomachs examined, all contained small grass-seeds, one also showed pieces of a large spider and of insects.  In two cases the birds had swallowed bits of stone.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;Madagascar; Africa from Cape Province north to Pungo Andongo in Angola, and through eastern Africa to Abyssinia; also in Morocco and southern Spain.  Sir Harry Johnston&apos;s reference to this coot from Stanley Pool and vicinity is undoubtedly erroneous. It is not known from western equatorial Africa, nor from any part of the Congo save the eastern border.  Here I have seen it only at the southern end of Lake Edward.  Count Gyldenstolpe recorded it from Lakes Bunyoni and Chahafi.  Douce collected it at Kisenyi on Lake Kivu, and G. Babault showed me a specimen from the Mokoto Lakes.  In life the pale
<pb n="33" id="t000120-p00039c.tif"/> gray bill, white frontal shield (bordered behind by two reddish knobs), and the lack of a white flank-stripe readily distinguish it from the moorhen.</p>
				<p>The red-knobbed coot is fond of quite open water, and builds a floating nest amid rushes, containing three to seven eggs.  These are cream-colored, freely speckled with small spots and blotches of very dark brown, measuring 49.7&ndash;59.7 mm. by 35.4&ndash;40.<note n="1">See W. L. Sclater, 1906, `Birds of S.

				</p>
				<p><taxonName idx_name="Podica senegalensis senegalensis">P. s. senegalensis</taxonName> ranges through Upper Guinea to the Niger delta, and across the northeastern Belgian Congo to Uganda.  It is a rather small bird, the wing in males 186&ndash;211 mm., in females 163&ndash;182 mm.  Underparts always whitish in the middle, even in fully adult males which are distinguished by their gray throats.</p>
				<p><taxonName idx_name="Podica senegalensis camerunensis">P. s. camerunensis</taxonName>, of forested Cameroon, Gaboon, and the central Congo basin, is a darker race, averaging slightly smaller.  Wings of males 177&ndash;212 mm., of females 152&ndash;179 mm.  In fully adult males the underparts are mottled with blackish or almost wholly black.</p>
				<p><taxonName idx_name="Podica senegalensis albipectus">P. s. albipectus</taxonName>, still doubtfully distinct from <taxonName idx_name="Podica senegalensis senegalensis">senegalensis</taxonName>, was described
<pb n="35" id="t000120-p00041u.tif"/> from the mouth of the Shiloango River.  Colored like <taxonName idx_name="Podica senegalensis senegalensis">senegalensis</taxonName>, it is supposedly larger, thus approaching <taxonName idx_name="Podica senegalensis petersii">petersii</taxonName>.</p>
				<p><taxonName idx_name="Podica senegalensis petersii">P. s. petersii</taxonName>, of eastern and southeastern Africa, the largest race, has the wing in males 220&ndash;252 mm., in females 184&ndash;215 mm.  Underparts always whitish in the middle.  Females of <taxonName idx_name="Podica senegalensis petersii">petersii</taxonName> are just about as large as males of typical <taxonName idx_name="Podica senegalensis senegalensis">senegalensis</taxonName>, and some confusion has naturally resulted.</p>
				<p>After careful examination of material in London, Berlin, Tervueren, and in several other museums, I am convinced that the birds of the north-eastern Congo forest are not separable from typical <taxonName idx_name="Podica senegalensis senegalensis">senegalensis</taxonName>.  Certainly they are not <taxonName idx_name="Podica senegalensis petersii">petersii</taxonName>, as stated by Mackworth-Praed and Grant. One of our adult females from Panga is faintly mottled with dark brown on the middle of lower breast and belly; and somewhere in that neighborhood one may expect intergradation with <taxonName idx_name="Podica senegalensis camerunensis">camerunensis</taxonName>.  Our adult male from Avakubi is in full plumage, with dark gray throat, a distinct white line down the side of the neck, and whitish breast and belly.  Its wing measures 207 mm.; that of the immature male from Panga, 186 mm.; and those of the adult females from Avakubi and Panga 168&ndash;172 mm. In the Congo Museum there is a sub-adult male from Dramba, Upper Uelle district, without gray on throat, wing 211 mm.  Once assumed, the gray throat seems to be retained at all seasons.  The Field Museum has an adult female with wing only 176 mm. taken at Entebbe, Uganda, by Sir Frederick J. Jackson.</p>
				<p>Finfoot is certainly a better name than sun-grebe for <taxonName>Podica</taxonName>, which is so little like a grebe.  It usually swims close to shore, and takes to the land when frightened.  When feeding in smaller streams within the forest, it readily escapes notice.  Only on rare occasions did we come upon these birds, generally while traveling by canoe along forested rivers.  They &quot;pattered&quot; or flew a little way ahead, soon dropping back into the water, and swam to the bank.  On land they can run rapidly, and are apt to be lost if not driven back toward the water.  Then they may scuttle out over the water again.  Never have I seen one dive.  Sometimes they sit on boughs or tree-trunks overhanging the water.</p>
				<p>Natives of this region know the finfoot as the author of a low reiterated booming sound,<note n="1">Compare Bates, 1930, `Handbook Birds W. Afr.,' p. 75.</note> said to be heard mostly when the water is rising in the streams; hence they picture the bird as calling for water and rejoicing in rains.  The Mangbetu and Medje call it &quot;Ne-dukenge,&quot; the Wabali &quot;Mukenge.&quot;  I doubt that <taxonName>Podica</taxonName> eats many fish.  In the seven stomachs I examined there were invariably remains of insects, often beetles, but also a dragon-fly larva, a green grasshopper, and wings of a
<pb n="36" id="t000120-p00042c.tif"/> dragon-fly.  One of the birds had also eaten a small crab, another, two snails, some small shrimps, and a small millipede.  There were usually small pieces of stone in the gizzard.  Bates<note n="1">1909, Ibis, p. 8.</note> recorded bits of prawns in the gizzard of <taxonName idx_name="Podica senegalensis camerunensis">P. s. camerunensis</taxonName>; and Chubb<note n="2">1908, Journ.

				<p>In the Ituri, breeding seems to begin with the rains, for an adult male with enlarged gonads was taken on April 28, while on May 22 a female was shot that had a fully formed egg in the oviduct.  This measured 50 mm. &times; 38.  Its ground-color was whitish, faintly tinged with buff, and the rufous spots, which marked it throughout, varied much in size&mdash; the smallest no larger than pin-points&mdash;but were largest and thickest on its larger end.  Most of the markings were slightly prolonged longitudinally, giving a streaked effect, and many slightly clouded over.  The ovary showed three empty follicles, and the remaining ova were not markedly enlarged.  It seemed that this must be the last egg of a set of three.</p>
				<p>Another female examined on July 22 showed five swollen ova in the ovary, so the number of eggs may sometimes be larger.  That the breeding season coincides with rains and high water in the rivers is confirmed by our three young specimens secured in September and December.</p>
				<p>The young bird from Niapu has the remiges less than half grown and retains the rufous-brown natal down on a large part of the crown.  A downy chick of <taxonName idx_name="Podica senegalensis senegalensis">senegalensis</taxonName> in the British Museum, from Southern Nigeria (October 6), still retaining the egg-tooth, has most of the upperparts chocolate-brown, forehead rufous, and a blacker line down the middle of the back, with other dark lines on the sides of the rump and upper surface of wings.  A blackish stripe crosses the lores, cheeks and throat whitish washed with brown, chest cinnamon-drab, and remaining underparts white.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;From the base of Mount Cameroon south to Sette Cama on the Gaboon coast, and eastward across the central Congo basin, in the forest belt, to Lukolela, Buta, and the vicinity of Stanley Falls.</p>
				<p>The Congo Museum now has five males of <taxonName idx_name="Podica senegalensis camerunensis">camerunensis</taxonName> in full plumage: from Karawa in the Ubangi district, from Buta in the Lower Uelle, from between Titule and Api, from 31 km. east of Stanleyville, and from Inkongo on the Sankuru River.  In the same museum there are an immature male and three adult females from Buta, two females from Eala, and another from Bikoro.  An immature male and a female from Kunungu near Bolobo seem referable to <taxonName idx_name="Podica senegalensis camerunensis">camerunensis</taxonName>; and a female from Leopoldville, with wing 179 mm., belongs either with this race or the rather doubtful <taxonName idx_name="Podica senegalensis albipectus">albipectus</taxonName>.</p>
				<p>On August 16, 1930, a native boy at Lukolela brought me another adult male of <taxonName idx_name="Podica senegalensis camerunensis">camerunensis</taxonName>, which I kept alive for eight days.  Mr. de Bellefroid saw it and assured me that he had shot several like it in the Lulonga district.  Finally, on December 14, 1930, a young bird in natal down was brought to me at Lukolela, where natives had captured it in a large forest swamp about a mile from the banks of the Congo.  It was similar in color to the chick of <taxonName idx_name="Podica senegalensis senegalensis">P. s. senegalensis</taxonName> already described.  Here again, breeding seems to take place in the first half of the rainy season. Dr. Schouteden also noted a chick taken from a nest near Eala on January 19.</p>

				<p>This race is light-breasted, like <taxonName idx_name="Podica senegalensis senegalensis">senegalensis</taxonName> and <taxonName idx_name="Podica senegalensis petersii">petersii</taxonName>, and supposedly intermediate between them in size.  Two females had wings 171 and 178 mm., not longer therefore than birds of that sex from Upper Guinea.  A third specimen, not sexed but resembling a female, had the wing 196 mm.  I am inclined to think it really an immature male.  The claim for the larger size of <taxonName idx_name="Podica senegalensis albipectus">albipectus</taxonName> rests mainly on a statement by
<pb n="38" id="t000120-p00044c.tif"/> Bocage<note n="1">1881, `Orn. Angola,' p. 488.</note> that Lucan and Petit collected a fully adult male at Insonn&eacute; on the Shiloango River, with wing 220 mm., tail 170, bill 47, metatarsus 44.</p>
				<p>If this proves to be correct, we may use the name <taxonName idx_name="Podica senegalensis albipectus">albipectus</taxonName> for a white-breasted race that probably extends eastward from the Loango Coast and Portuguese Congo to the Kasai district, and possibly even to the Lualaba River.  We have a female collected by Father Callewaert at Luluabourg, apparently adult, and too well spotted on the back for <taxonName idx_name="Podica senegalensis camerunensis">camerunensis</taxonName>.  Its wing measures 181 mm., close to the maximum for <taxonName idx_name="Podica senegalensis senegalensis">senegalensis</taxonName>.  The Field Museum has another female from Luluabourg, with wing 188 mm. long.  Were it not for Bocage&apos;s measurements, <taxonName idx_name="Podica senegalensis albipectus">albipectus</taxonName> would seem scarcely more distinct from typical <taxonName idx_name="Podica senegalensis senegalensis">senegalensis</taxonName> than are the birds of the Ituri district.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;From the mouth of the Tana River and the upper Thika River in Kenya Colony south through Mozambique, Nyasaland, Zululand, Transvaal, and Natal to eastern Cape Province.  Also westward across the Katanga and Rhodesia and probably to southern Angola and Damaraland.</p>
				<p>Specimens from East Africa south to Mozambique and Nyasaland average slightly smaller than those of South Africa, but the difference is scarcely important enough for the recognition of subspecies.  The wing-length varies somewhat as follows: Eastern Africa south to Mozambique and Nyasaland, &male; 220&ndash;242, &female; 184&ndash;197 mm.; South Africa, &male; 231&ndash;252, &female; 186&ndash;215.</p>
				<p>From the Katanga, the Congo Museum has a gray-throated male collected at Kapiri by de Baillet-Latour on November 19, 1913.  It has the thick bill of <taxonName idx_name="Podica senegalensis petersii">petersii</taxonName>, with exposed culmen 54 mm.  The wing measures but 215 mm.  This may be evidence of intergradation between <taxonName idx_name="Podica senegalensis petersii">petersii</taxonName> and the smaller West African forms.  Dr. J. Bequaert has also given me a careful description from his notebook of a gray-throated male of <taxonName>Podica</taxonName> killed at Bukama on April 23, 1911.  He did not measure the length of the wing, but noted the length from tip of bill to tip of tail as
<pb n="39" id="t000120-p00045c.tif"/> 56 cm., spread of wings as 65 cm.  These dimensions seem smaller than those of South African specimens of <taxonName idx_name="Podica senegalensis petersii">petersii</taxonName>.</p>
				<p>The habits of <taxonName idx_name="Podica senegalensis petersii">petersii</taxonName> are similar in every respect to those of <taxonName idx_name="Podica senegalensis senegalensis">senegalensis</taxonName>. A nest of <taxonName idx_name="Podica senegalensis petersii">petersii</taxonName> described by Mr. E. C. Chubb,<note n="1">1908, Journ. S. Afr. Orn.

				<p>Another nest, found in October by W. Krienke in the Beatrice district of Southern Rhodesia, was likewise a platform of sticks on a fallen tree over a pool.  Eggs two, rich cream-color, with blotches of light purplish-brown and reddish-orange spots.<note n="2">Priest, 1934, `Birds of S.

<pb n="41" id="t000120-p00047u.tif"/> and the highlands of Abyssinia.  Sir Harry Johnston&apos;s statement that the wattled crane occurred on Stanley Pool and the Congo River was surely erroneous.  Such a conspicuous bird could never have been overlooked there by collectors.  Yet Admiral Lynes has found it at Banda in the western Kasai, and R. Gildof at Kindu on the Lualaba.</p>
				<p>The Congo Museum has a skin from Nieuwdorp in the Upper Katanga, and another from Kinda in the eastern Lulua district, so possibly this is the &quot;Grosser Kranich?&quot; noted by B&ouml;hm at Lake Upemba.  <note n="1">Schalow, 1886, J. f. O., p. 434.</note> Neave collected two specimens in the Chambezi Valley, and remarked that they were not uncommon in the open country on the high plateau, especially in the Lake Bangweolo district.  He found them in pairs, or sometimes as many as five together.  Flocks of thirty-two, and even of sixty-five, have been reported in Southern Rhodesia.</p>
				<p>Mr. J. De Riemaecker, who secured specimens near Elisabethville and at Malambwe, 65 km. to the northeast on the Mwati River, writes me that the wattled crane is fairly common in the marshy plains or along the borders of rivers when fringed with grassy spaces, but he does not find more than two together.  They are extraordinarily wary, he adds, and since they keep to treeless places, they take wing at a distance of three or four hundred yards.</p>
				<p>The wattled crane builds a large nest in shallow water or on a rock surrounded by water, laying two eggs, pale olive-brown faintly blotched or clouded with darker brown, 98&ndash;116.5 mm. &times; 59&ndash;69.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;Eastern Cape Colony north to the Cunene River, Lake Kabamba on the Lualaba, the eastern Congo border to the vicinity of Mahagi, Uganda, and Kenya Colony.  Two races are recognized, typical <taxonName idx_name="Balearica regulorum regulorum">regulorum</taxonName> living in the southern part of the range,
<pb n="42" id="t000120-p00048c.tif"/> northward presumably to the southeastern Congo and the vicinity of Zanzibar.  <taxonName idx_name="Balearica regulorum gibbericeps">B. r. gibbericeps</taxonName> of the more northern parts of eastern Africa is closely similar, but the bare skin of the cheeks extends farther upward in a point toward the hind-crown.</p>
				<p>The alleged occurrence of crowned cranes in the Lower Congo or near Stanley Pool is scarcely credible.  In Angola the species does not seem to extend north of the Cunene Valley.  There is, to be sure, an old mounted bird in the Congo Museum labeled &quot;District du Bas Congo,&quot; but this locality was not even mentioned by Dubois (1905).  Pechu&euml;l-Loesche<note n="1">1888, `Loango Exp.,' III, pt. 1, p. 252.</note> reported flocks of large crane-like birds resting on the sandbanks of the lower Congo and Kwilu rivers, but his description scarcely suggested <taxonName>Balearica</taxonName>.</p>
				<p>Crowned cranes are not uncommon in the Katanga, where Neave and Mouritz noted them especially in the low-lying river valleys, in small parties.  The birds of this region are believed to be <taxonName idx_name="Balearica regulorum regulorum">B. r. regulorum</taxonName>, and a sketch from Dr. Bequaert&apos;s notebook of one killed at Bukama shows the posterior upper border of the bare cheeks as rounded, not running to a point.  A party of six birds was noted by Bequaert on a sand-bank in the Lualaba near Bukama on October 12, but they generally sought their food on higher ground, in native farms and similar spots.</p>
				<p>In South Africa nests of this crane, built of rushes or reeds, are located in wet, open marshes.  From December to May seems to be the breeding season there, two eggs being laid, which are bluish or greenish white when not soiled with brown, and measure 82.5&ndash;89 mm. &times; 51&ndash;63.5.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;Coastlands near Kilimanjaro, Kenya Colony, Uganda, and the eastern border of the Congo from the vicinity of Wadelai on the Bahr-el-Jebel and Mahagi near Lake Albert south at least to the northern end of Tanganyika.  At Nyanza on the northeast shore of this lake, Raven secured an example (in U. S. National Museum) agreeing in the shape of the bare cheek-patch with others from Kenya Colony. The same is true of those in the Congo Museum from Uvira and the vicinity of Lake Edward.</p>
				<p>Although the name <taxonName idx_name="Balearica pavonina">B. pavonina</taxonName> (Linn&aelig;us) has sometimes been used for the crowned cranes of Lake Albert, that dark-necked Sudanese species does not reach the Belgian Congo.  In the Ubangi-Shari territory, Blancou<note n="1">1933, Ois. R. F. O., (N. S.) III, p. 41.</note> noted it only once on the upper Kukuru River, about 140 miles north of the Ubangi River.  The eastern race, <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Balearica pavonina cecili&aelig;">B. pavonina cecili&aelig;</taxonName> Mitchell</taxon>, while common near the Bahr-el-Ghazal, does not seem to frequent the White Nile south of Lake No.  Emin noted that in &quot;<taxonName idx_name="Balearica pavonina">pavonina</taxonName>&quot; from Wadelai the long feathers of the neck were light ash-gray, and the bare cheeks pure white, bordered with red above.  These colors are characteristic of <taxonName idx_name="Balearica pavonina gibbericeps">gibbericeps</taxonName>.<note n="2">See Mitchell, 1904, P. Z. S. Lond., II, pp. 200&ndash;205, Figs. 37&ndash;40.  I cannot agree with Grote (1928, O. Mb., p. 179), that all the African crowned cranes are races of a single species.</note>
				</p>
				<p>Emin reported crowned cranes as common about Lake Albert, usually in pairs or threes and fours, resting on the banks of rivers, and going out in the morning and afternoon to feed in native fields.</p>
				<p>Around the eastern base of Ruwenzori, Lake Edward, and throughout the Kivu highlands, wherever the vegetation is open, crowned cranes are a common sight, fairly confiding, and seldom molested.  I have seen them about Lake Bunyoni, at 6700 feet, and in a small marsh on the western slope of Mt. Mikeno, at 7200 feet.  Dr. Bequaert told me that natives had found a nest in the latter spot on March 22, with two downy young.  Another young bird, somewhat more than half-grown, was brought to the post of Rutshuru on May 29.</p>
				<p>Flocks of twelve to sixteen birds are not rare; and on the south of Lake Edward, in May, I saw some of a party give their well-known dance, two birds facing each other, with wings upraised, stepping high.<note n="3">See Bland-Sutton, 1911, `Man and Beast in E. Ethiopia,' pp. 362&ndash;365.</note>  The native name in the vicinity of Rutshuru is &quot;Malu&quot; or &quot;Maru,&quot; and imitates
<pb n="44" id="t000120-p00050c.tif"/> well their doleful call, heard at sundown or dusk and carrying afar. It is often accompanied by a loud grunting note, slowly repeated, doubtless by another bird.  At sunset they go to roost on large trees, usually near water.  At Luvungi in the Ruzizi Valley, I watched a flock of no less than fifty-five flying over.</p>

				<p>ADULT FEMALE.&mdash;Iris whitish brown, rim of eyelids, corners of mouth, and small naked areas at sides of head pinkish gray; culmen brownish black, rest of bill pale gray; feet light grayish yellow.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;Over the greater part of the African continent, though rare near the Cape, extending northwest to the Gambia, as well as to Darfur and Abyssinia.  Within our area, however, it is wholly lacking in the forests, and thus unknown in much of the central Congo.  On the north, east, and south of our territory, it is undoubtedly the commonest species of bustard, and it occurs even in the Fernand Vaz region of the Gaboon.</p>
				<p>Specimens from north of the Zambesi River have wings measuring 303&ndash;355 mm. (both sexes included), whereas those from South Africa are larger, as Count Gyldenstolpe pointed out, with wings 337&ndash;380. For the southern race Bannerman<note n="1">1930, Ibis, p. 435.</note> proposed the name <taxonName>Lissotis melanogaster major</taxonName>, but the earlier <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Lissotis melanogaster notophila">L. m. notophila</taxonName> Oberholser</taxon><note n="2">1905, Proc. U.S. Nat. Mus., XXVIII, p. 836 (Durban, Natal).</note> will have to be used.</p>
				<p>The black-bellied bustard is found in the Upper Uelle district throughout the year and is not averse to alighting directly in the grass, even when it is a yard high.  Four or five was the maximum number ever seen there in one day.  Of course it was more fond of open spots amid the grass and bush, and in any event rather shy, usually taking wing a long gunshot away.  Especially attractive to it are old fields and pastures, the latter furnishing what seem to be perhaps its favorite
<pb n="46" id="t000120-p00052c.tif"/> food, dung-beetles.  The flight is strong, with rapid flaps of the wings, the head stretched straight out forward.  The long slender neck, supporting a much fuller, rounded head, lends striking character to the bird in any posture.</p>
				<p>All the black-bellied bustards I saw and shot were silent, but an Azande hunter, who knew them well, imitated their voice as a whistle followed after a short pause by a loud &quot;pop!&quot;<note n="1">Very similar descriptions of it have been given by Carpenter, 1920, `Naturalist on L. Victoria,' p. 153; Belcher, 1930, `Birds of Nyasaland,' p. 73; and Krienke, 1931, Ostrich, II, p. 44.</note> We secured no specimen in the Uelle with gonads enlarged, nor any very young birds; and I suspect that they breed when the grass is high.</p>
				<p>Nowhere have I noticed <taxonName>Lissotis melanogaster</taxonName> in greater abundance than on the western shore of Lake Albert near Kasenyi.  There we saw eight or nine in a day, during early September, but four examples collected were all non-breeding.  In the Kasai district the species must be common.  Father Callewaert has sent us specimens from Lake Munkamba and Luluabourg.</p>
				<p>Admiral Lynes<note n="2">1916, Ibis. p. 202.  See also Paget-Wilkes, 1938, Ibis, p. 121.</note> found that in Darfur this small bustard arrived in mid-June and stayed until August, apparently without breeding.  Yet there is reason to believe that the rainy season is their usual period of reproduction, for eggs have been taken in Northern Nigeria in July and August, in Abyssinia in September and in Nyasaland in December. In western Kenya Colony they have been found on February 20 and April 18.</p>
				<p>While sets of two eggs have often been recorded,<note n="3">Paget-Wilkes, 1925, Ibis, p. 529; Jourdain, 1929, Ool. Rec., IX, p. 73.</note> a single egg seems sometimes to be laid.  No attempt is made at nest-building, the eggs being deposited on bare ground amid tall grass, sometimes near the base of a tree.  A single egg sent us by Father Callewaert from the vicinity of Luluabourg, Kasai district, is dull olive greenish, diffusely spotted with rather dark brown, and measures 58.9 &times; 49.5 mm.  This is the normal color, but dimensions have been given by others as 50&ndash;65 mm. &times; 43&ndash;54.</p>
				<p>The stomach-contents of eight individuals were noted, and showed that <taxonName>Lissotis melanogaster</taxonName> is almost wholly insectivorous, though two birds killed in January had eaten numbers of soft yellow flowers and flower-buds, and two other birds had swallowed some small seeds. Among the insects eaten, beetles predominated; and numbers of them were found in seven stomachs; grasshoppers in four, hemiptera in three, caterpillars in three, crickets in two, termites in two, and mantises in
<pb n="47" id="t000120-p00053c.tif"/> two.  One bird had eaten more than twenty mantises.  Single centipedes were found twice; a cicada, an adult ant-lion, a wasp, and an ant, each once.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;From Cape Province to the southern Congo, East Africa, Western Abyssinia, and across the Sudan to the Gambia.  Three races are now admitted.  <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Neotis cafra cafra">N. c. cafra</taxonName> (Lichtenstein)</taxon> is restricted to the region south of the Zambesi.  <taxonName idx_name="Neotis cafra jacksoni">N. c. jacksoni</taxonName>, generally darker in color but less rufous on hind-neck, ranges from Angola through Northern Rhodesia and the southern Congo to northern Kenya Colony and Uganda.  <taxonName idx_name="Neotis cafra denhami">N. c. denhami</taxonName>, of slightly larger size and with much paler rufous hind-neck, is the Sudanese form.</p>
				<p><taxonName idx_name="Neotis cafra jacksoni">Neotis c. jacksoni</taxonName>, though still unknown from the Kasai district, has been collected near Stanley Pool on the Congo River, in the savannas of
<pb n="48" id="t000120-p00054c.tif"/> the Manyema, and in the Katanga.  The Congo Museum has two specimens, apparently females, from Kasenga on the Luapula River (Dr. Barth&eacute;l&eacute;mi) and from Kassabo near Kinda in the Lulua district (Charliers). The Field Museum has specimens from Katobwe on the Lualaba River, and Katapena, south of Lake Upemba (Conover and Zimmer). The records from the Kisaka and Kagera districts are probably not quite within our limits, yet there is good reason to suppose that this bustard does reach Ruanda or Urundi.  On the other hand, there are no reliable records from the vicinity of Ruwenzori or Lake Albert.</p>
				<p>While van Someren<note n="1">1933, Journ. E. Afr. Ug. N. H. Soc., No. 47&ndash;48, p. 107.</note> mentions its occurrence northeast of Lake Albert, the only specimen I have seen from the Bahr-el-Jebel was denhami. The young bustard mentioned by Emin<note n="2">See Schubotz, 1921, `Tageb. Emin Pascha,' VI, pt. 2, p. 49.</note> from Wadelai was probably also <taxonName idx_name="Neotis cafra denhami">denhami</taxonName>.</p>
				<p>The breeding season of <taxonName idx_name="Neotis cafra jacksoni">jacksoni</taxonName> in Kenya Colony is from February to June, perhaps also in November.  Jackson and van Someren have watched the males displaying, strutting like turkeys, and puffing the neck so that its feathering fans out in front like a great ball.  The voice is compared to the &quot;booming&quot; of a bittern.</p>
				<p>The nest of the typical South African race is said to be a depression scratched in the ground, with a wisp of grass at most for a lining, and the eggs two in number.  These are light reddish brown or brownish olive, with diffuse markings of darker brown and purplish gray; dimensions 73.6&ndash;78 mm. &times; 53&ndash;55.</p>

				<p>ADULTS OF BOTH SEXES.&mdash;Iris yellowish white; bill black above, light gray below, naked portions of skin on head dusky; feet light grayish-yellow.</p>
				<p>The differences between <taxonName idx_name="Neotis cafra denhami">N. c. denhami</taxonName> and <taxonName idx_name="Neotis cafra jacksoni">jacksoni</taxonName> seem to be very constant. All our specimens agree in the upward extension of the rufous coloration to the nape, and in lacking the white lateral stripe separating it from the fore-neck.  The gray of the fore-neck, in adult males of <taxonName idx_name="Neotis cafra denhami">denhami</taxonName>, is somewhat lighter than in <taxonName idx_name="Neotis cafra jacksoni">jacksoni</taxonName>, but in females is heavily vermiculated.  On the whole, the coloration of the neck is paler and duller in <taxonName idx_name="Neotis cafra denhami">denhami</taxonName>, but even adult males have a well-marked light median stripe on the back of the crown.</p>
				<p>In size <taxonName idx_name="Neotis cafra denhami">denhami</taxonName> exceeds <taxonName idx_name="Neotis cafra jacksoni">jacksoni</taxonName>, and the measurements of our adults of the former are as follows: two males, wing, 595, 631 mm.; tail, 300, 317; bill, 87, 93; metatarsus, 173, 181.  Four females: wing, 479&ndash;515 mm. (average 500); tail, 254&ndash;290 (274.7); bill, 69&ndash;76 (72.6); metatarsus, 130&ndash;145 (139.7).</p>
				<p>The down of the nestling is buff, lightest on belly, but with a complex pattern of black lines about the head and neck, and heavily mottled with black on the crown and all over the back and wings.  Its iris was light brownish; bill gray, with whitish tip and greenish base; feet light greenish-gray.</p>
				<p>The juvenal plumage in pattern resembles that of the adult female, but all the light markings above are more orange-buff, with a large spot of this color at the tip of each feather of the back.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;From the western border of Abyssinia and the White Nile just north of Lake Albert westward to Lake Chad, Sierra Leone, and the Gambia Colony.  The southern limit is in the savannas just north of the equatorial forest, as in the Uelle district, Nigeria, and the Ivory Coast.  The southward extension of the range to the northern Congo does not hold for the entire year; this is another example of a Sudanese migrant, occupying the savannas of the Uelle during the dry season.</p>
				<p>During the seasons of 1910, 1911, and 1912, we noted that this fine bustard, the greatest game-bird of the region, put in appearance about Niangara and Faradje toward the latter part of November.  We saw many more of them than we shot, because of their wariness; still two or three individuals were all one would ever note in a day.  They arrived before the grass had been burned, and had to content themselves at first with cultivated fields or a few naturally barren spots.  Then patches of burned country became available, and finally the great grass-fires of the dry season opened up the whole country to them.</p>
				<p>The natives know their habits well; and near Aba we found them building light fences in favorable spots, with nooses hung in occasional openings, the effectiveness of which were proved by the feathers of their victims.  This is not the &quot;winter range&quot; of Denham&apos;s bustard; instead it comes in here to breed; and by January 8 a large brown egg, doubtless correctly" identified by its finder as belonging to this bustard, was brought
<pb n="50" id="t000120-p00056c.tif"/> to us.  Its ground-color was light brown (wood-brown of Ridgway), and the rather numerous but indistinct markings were of a darker brown, tinged with rufous and olive.  Size: 84.5 &times; 54.8 mm.</p>
				<p>At about the same date a young chick was secured and other young birds were taken in February, April, and May.  Dissections of the old birds likewise placed the season of reproduction in December, and perhaps the two months following.  We never saw more than one young bird with the parents: by May they are well grown, and not later than the end of this month all the birds quit the district, and are not seen again for at least five months.</p>
				<p>Admiral Lynes&apos;s observations in Darfur<note n="1">1925, Ibis, p. 555.  See also Lipscomb, 1937, Ibis, p. 674.</note> now show where this bustard spends the off-season, for there is a marked northward migration there from June to August.  One only was noted during the southward migration, on October 27; and only a single specimen was obtained in January.</p>
				<p>The first adult male we shot weighed ten pounds, this being three pounds heavier than an adult female; but Mr. N. Macris, a merchant at Faradje, assured me that he had killed one of fourteen pounds.  Later we found this to be the actual weight of the male from Niangara.</p>
				<p>In the air these bustards looked very heavy, but traveled with strong direct flight, the neck extended, and seldom gave one a second chance to stalk them.  Except for a loud hoarse cry from a wounded bird, I never heard the voice.  Two expert native hunters of the region described it as an abrupt raucous note, resembling the bark of the bushbuck, whence the Azande have named it &quot;Ba-zere-bodi&quot; meaning literally big-bird-bushbuck, while the Mangbetu name &quot;Nagba&quot; is similarly an imitation of its call, &quot;gba!&quot; appended to the article &quot;na.&quot;  This sound has been heard from a captive bird in the London Zoo<note n="2">Forbes, 1880, P. Z. S. Lond., p. 478.</note> and it is accompanied by a swelling of the &oelig;sophagus with air.  There is no gular pouch like that of <taxonName>Otis tarda</taxonName>.</p>
				<p>The tail is carried slightly raised, and somewhat folded.  In one case it had been so frayed from rubbing against the grass that of the two middle rectrices and their greater coverts little remained at the end of the breeding season but the bare shafts.</p>
				<p>The food is largely made up of insects, which were found among the stomach-contents of all ten specimens.  Beetles were present in every case, including one elater and one cerambycid, but dung-beetles much more frequently.  Grasshoppers figured in seven instances, hemiptera
<pb n="51" id="t000120-p00057c.tif"/> in three, mantises in two, ants twice, a moth only once, and caterpillars (hairless) twice.  A single millipede completed the list of animal food; but vegetable substances were present in seven stomachs, and included seeds, some red berries, tender stalks bearing flower-buds, and pieces of sweet-potato.</p>

Jackson<note n="2">1926, `Notes on Game Birds of Kenya and Uganda,' pp. 208, 209.</note> believed that Dr. Dobell may have seen it once at Rusasa in the adjacent province of Ankole.  I have had a similar report from Mr. R.S. Hill for eastern Ruanda, but the weight of the largest bustard he could remember was only 16 pounds. An adult male of <taxonName idx_name="Choriotis kori struthiunculus">struthiunculus</taxonName> would weigh around 30 pounds.</p>

				<p>SPECIMENS.&mdash;Avakubi, &female;, Dec. 2.  Gamangui, &female;, Feb. 10.  Faradje, 6 &male;, Jan. 1, Feb. 17, Apr. 1, 17, Nov. 26, Dec. 3; 4 &female;, Feb. 15, Mar. 15, Nov. 22, Dec. 2.</p>
				<p>ADULTS.&mdash;Iris and rim of eyelids yellow, bare skin behind eye green; bill black with yellow at base of maxilla, green at base of mandible; feet pale grayish green, claws black.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;From Senegambia and the Sudan to Egypt, Abyssinia, and Lake Rudolf, south to the Loango Coast and the Ituri River. The southern part of the range seems to be occupied for only about seven months at most; this is definitely established at least for the Uelle and Ituri districts.</p>
				<p>Specimens from Egypt, Abyssinia, and the eastern Sudan are grayer, less edged above with cinnamon, than those of western Africa, and are often recognized as a valid race, assimilis B&auml;deker</taxon>, or more correctly inornatus Salvadori</taxon>.<note n="1">1865, Atti. Soc. Ital. Sci. Nat. Milano, VIII, p. 381 (Ethiopia).</note> The difference is slight, evident mainly while the plumage is fresh, and specimens from the northern Congo are in general intermediate between the two races.</p>
				<p>In the Ituri forest the Senegal thick-knee is little more than accidental. We saw it only twice, first on the Nepoko River, later on the Ituri; both times during the northern dry season.  Yet it is common during the dry season just beyond the northern border of the forest.</p>
				<p>Along the rivers in the Uelle district it arrives each year in early November, before the rains have ceased, and while the streams are still in full flood.  During the day the birds stand placidly along the shady river-banks, but at dusk become very active, flying along to more open spots, and out to cultivated fields or even village squares.  Here they walk about and feed, largely upon insects.  In the eight stomachs examined we invariably found insects, usually beetles; but grasshoppers, a large earwig, and a cricket were also noted, and one toad.</p>
				<pb n="53" id="t000120-p00059c.tif"/>
				<p>From the time of their arrival they make their presence known at night by a series of a dozen to twenty shrill piping notes, at first swelling in volume, then dying away toward the close.  This calling is especially frequent under a bright moon.  A shorter complaining note is sometimes given in flight, both by night and by day.</p>
				<p>For the first two months of their stay they show no disposition to nest.  It was only on February 17 that we found our first nest, in a hollow in the sand on a wooded islet near Faradje.  The two eggs were dull buff, thickly spotted and blotched with dark brown, measuring 45.6 &times; 35.9 mm. and 46.2 &times; 35.8.  The male bird was incubating.  Another nest was found on an island in the Uelle River below Dungu on March 2. In northern Uganda Pitman<note n="1">1931, Ool. Rec., XI, pp. 62&ndash;64, 2 Figs</note> found nests in these same months, and gave measurements of eggs as 49.1&ndash;52.2 &times; 32.4&ndash;33.2 mm.</p>
				<p>At Faradje these thick-knees were still heard calling in April, but a month later they had practically disappeared.  Cheesman found a nest in Abyssinia, April 22, while in Egypt they appear to be resident, and are known to nest in May.</p>

				<p>SPECIMENS.&mdash;Zambi, 2 &female;, June 28, 30.  Kwamouth, &male;, July 14.</p>
				<p>ADULTS.&mdash;Iris yellow; bill black, greenish around nostrils; feet light grayish-green.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;From Cape Province north to Lamu, the Athi River in Kenya Colony, Lake Albert, Upoto on the Congo River, Gaboon, and Liberia.  In Liberia and Nigeria there is a large-billed race, <taxon><taxonName idx_name="&OElig;dicnemus vermiculatus b&uuml;ttikoferi">&OElig;. v. b&uuml;ttikoferi</taxonName> Reichenow</taxon>, with culmen 50&ndash;54 mm. In the remainder of the range the culmen usually measures 41&ndash;43.5 mm., but specimens from the Gaboon are intermediate in this respect, with measurements of 45&ndash;48 mm.  Seven specimens from the Congo River have the culmen (to base) 42.5&ndash;47 mm.  Since I can find no appreciable difference in color between these skins and others from southeastern Africa, I regard them as belonging to <taxonName idx_name="&OElig;dicnemus vermiculatus vermiculatus">&OElig;. v. vermiculatus</taxonName>, in spite of the very different conclusion of Dr. Friedmann (1930).</p>
				<p>This stone-curlew is seldom found within the Congo forest except along rivers, but is common along the southern and eastern borders of this area.  Our specimens were secured along the bank of the Kwa (&equals;Kasai) where it joins the Congo, and on some small islands near Zambi.</p>
				<p>More recently I have studied the behavior of the vermiculated thickknee at Lukolela on the middle Congo River, where they are not migratory, and were noted occasionally from August, 1930, to February, 1931. During the day they were noted only on islands in the river, singly or in pairs; but late at night they would be found walking on the roads through the cacao-groves, even a couple of miles back from the river. An electric flashlight directed on them would sometimes draw a faint yellow glow from their eyes.  Although the voice has been described as similar to that of <taxonName idx_name="&OElig;dicnemus senegalensis">&OElig;. senegalensis</taxonName>, I never heard any such whistles near Lukolela or in the Lower Congo.</p>
				<p>The breeding habits<note n="1">See especially R. and V. van Someren, 1911, `Studies of Birdlife in Uganda,' p. 8, Pls. VI, VII; and Pitman, 1928, Ool. Rec., VIII, pp. 102&ndash;105, Figs. a, b (photos of nests).</note> are known to be similar to those of <taxonName idx_name="&OElig;dicnemus senegalensis">&OElig;. senegalensis</taxonName>; the two eggs of the same coloration, measuring 45&ndash;52 mm. by 33&ndash;39 mm.  On the middle Congo they must nest on the sandy shores of islands in the river, presumably during the periods of low water. The female taken at Zambi on the lower Congo, June 30, was in breeding condition.</p>

				<p>The stone-curlew of Europe and western Asia migrates south in winter to the Red Sea and the eastern Sudan, and also reaches Kyambu and Naivasha in Kenya Colony.  We have a specimen taken in the Uasin Gishu district by Jenness Richardson.  There is a remote possibility that it may sometimes reach the Congo border in the vicinity of Mahagi.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;From Cape Province north to the Lower Congo, Lake Tanganyika, southern Arabia, Eritrea, and Darfur.

				<p>The Cape thick-knee is unknown in the forest area of the Congo, as it is in the Kasai district, but has been found in the Lower Congo, the Katanga, and the Ruzizi Valley.  Our single specimen was secured by Lang on an island in the Congo River near Zambi.  In South Africa, this species is often found in open country on stony flats or along the slopes of low hills, often in small flocks.  It has a loud plaintive note, and is somewhat nocturnal in habits.  Two eggs are laid on the ground
<pb n="56" id="t000120-p00062c.tif"/> or on sand; they are stone-gray or light buff, with blotches of dark brown, and measure 48&ndash;56 mm. by 36&ndash;43.</p>

				<p>SPECIMENS.&mdash;Stanleyville, &female;, Aug. 11.  Avakubi, &male; im., Dec. 27.  Niangara, &male;, May 3.  Dungu, &female;, Mar. 1.  Faradje, &male; im., Mar. 10.</p>
				<p>ADULTS.&mdash;Iris dark brown; bill bluish gray, frontal shield light blue; feet dirty greenish brown.  In the young, naked skin of forehead green.</p>
				<p>Males as a rule are markedly smaller than females, having wings about 143&ndash;155 mm., whereas those of females measure 156&ndash;173 mm.  Any overlapping in these dimensions will probably be attributable to the shorter wings of immature females.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;Nearly the whole Ethiopian Region, north to latitude 12&Degree; in the eastern, and to the Senegal River on the western side of Africa.  In the Congo uniformly but sparingly distributed, save along the larger rivers and lakes, where it is more abundant.  Thus the &quot;lily-trotter&quot; is to be seen commonly from the Congo River steamers; and about the large papyrus swamp just to the east of Boma it was a frequent sight, and even more often heard, as it repeated its petulant note, over and over, without changing the tone: &quot;ka-ka-ka-ka&hellip;&quot;</p>
				<p>Along heavily forested rivers, like the Ituri, it is generally seen only where there is a growth of rank grass along the shores, and this is often a sign of clearing by man at some time in the past.  In flight, the legs and long toes are held out behind, and the wings beat rather rapidly.  In this forest region I have never come upon more than two birds together, nor did I see them at any great distance from the shore on floating plants. Along the Uelle River, I have watched them walking on wet, mossy rocks.  About Lake Edward, lily-trotters are abundant, a half-dozen often feeding together.  Even on Lake Bunyoni, at an altitude of 6700 feet, they are not uncommon, and may be seen standing and walking on the large lily-pads, a foot or more in diameter.  Both the stomachs examined contained small seeds, rather hard, and little stones, while one held also a small snail with conical shell.</p>

				<p>The female taken at Stanleyville in August, when the river was very low, was in breeding condition.  Friedmann<note n="1">1930, Bull. 153, U. S. Nat. Mus., p. 153.</note> claimed that breeding was timed with the beginning of the long rains, except around large lakes.  But Belcher<note n="2">1930, `Birds of Nyasaland,' p. 70.</note> found that this jacana nested in Nyasaland from June to August, during the dry season; and Emin (in Schubotz, 1921) reported numbers of nests on the Bahr-el-Jebel near Gaba Shambe at the end of April.  We did not find a nest, but it is known to be built of floating plant-material and to contain usually four eggs.  These are pale ochreous-brown, generously scrawled with very dark brown or blackish, mingled at times with lighter markings.  Dimensions, 30&ndash;35 mm. &times; 20&ndash;23.  According to Emin, a chick taken from the egg was wholly velvet-black, its bill flesh-red with whitish tip, and the large feet reddish gray with dark claws.  His mention of the size of the feet would seem to obviate any error.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;The smaller African lily-trotter ranges from Cape Province and Natal to Damaraland, and north through eastern Africa to Lake Naivasha and the upper Nile near Fashoda, thence westward to Fort Lamy near Lake Chad<note n="3">Berlioz, 1934, Bull. Mus. Hist. Nat. Paris, VI, p. 492.</note> and Hago, Northern Nigeria.<note n="4">Buxton, 1935, Ibis, p. 107.</note>  A specimen was obtained by Count Gyldenstolpe at Lake Chahafi, almost within the border of Belgian Ruanda, so it may certainly be looked for about the swampy margins of many of the lakes in the Kivu highlands. Neave found it near Lake Bangweolo and Raven collected a specimen on the Kafue River in Northern Rhodesia, so it was to be expected in the Upper Katanga.  In examining the collection of J. De Riemaecker at Ghent, I found that he had collected a specimen along the Kafubu River near Elisabethville which he mistook for a chick of <taxonName>Actophilornis</taxonName>.</p>
				<p>Both in its haunts and its nesting this species is said to resemble the commoner large lily-trotter.  Its color-pattern is remarkably similar to that of the juvenal plumage of the larger <taxonName>Actophilornis</taxonName>, and the feathering of its forehead retains a downy appearance throughout life.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;Southern Asia from Asia Minor and southern Arabia to China, Japan, the Philippines, Ceylon, and Borneo; also Madagascar, and Africa from the Cape Province north to Senegal, Egypt, and Abyssinia.  This vast region is occupied by the typical race, while <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Rostratula benghalensis australis">R. b. australis</taxonName> (Gould)</taxon> inhabits Australia and Tasmania.  In Africa the painted snipe avoids the forests of Upper and Lower Guinea. The only Congo records are from the Uelle, the Lower Congo, Lakes Albert and Edward, the Lualaba River, and the Katanga.</p>
				<pb n="60" id="t000120-p00066u.tif"/>
				<p>Lang and I never saw one in the Uelle; but at Kabare on Lake Edward, toward the middle of May, I came across several, at different times.  They were hiding amid low rushes on the shore, but did not conceal themselves so effectively as true snipe.  A nervous, up-and-down jerk of the head at short intervals seemed a point of resemblance to plover and other shore-birds.  When going but a short distance, to drop again into the herbage, the flight might be termed rail-like; but it is fairly rapid and rather plover-like when the bird is traveling longer distances.  Of course, they never rise with the speed of true snipe.  A female collected on May 13 was in condition to breed.</p>
				<p>The painted snipe is almost always described as more like a rail in habits than a snipe.  Nevertheless, it is clearly a Limicoline bird, and Dr. P. R. Lowe<note n="1">1931, Ibis, pp. 491&ndash;534, 721.</note> regards <taxonName>Rostratula</taxonName> as a very generalized member of the shore-bird group, worthy of separation in a distinct family, and with only superficial resemblances to the true snipe.  The adult female is larger and more richly colored than the male; and her voice is said to be deeper or more guttural than that of the male, as a result of a slight twisting and other modification of the trachea not exhibited by that of the male.<note n="2">Wood-Mason, 1878, P. Z. S. Lond., p. 745, Pl. XLVII.</note>
				</p>
				<p>According to Dr. van Someren, the painted snipe breeds in East Africa, and it is probably not migratory in those parts of the Congo where it is found.  Neave noted it as abundant on the partially flooded plains to the east of Lake Bangweolo in June and July, and several examples have since been secured in the Upper Katanga.  Conover collected specimens at Katobwe and Katapena, near Lake Upemba.</p>
				<p>The nest is a depression in the ground sometimes lined with leaves or herbage, and the usual set is of four eggs.  These are of a dull buff or stone-gray color, with a few purplish shell-markings and more numerous, though sharply circumscribed, blackish spots.  Oval rather than pyriform, they measure 31.5&ndash;39 mm. by 22.5&ndash;27.4.</p>

				<p>In the Congo this plain-colored plover is fairly common to the east of the forest, living along the borders of lakes, but it has not been noticed in the highlands of the Kivu or Upper Katanga.  On the shores of Lake Edward I found it usually in parties of four to ten, on the muddy margins of shallow pools back of the reed-beds fringing the lake.  On the middle Congo near Lukolela I did not see it, and Dybowski collected it at Brazzaville, not on the Ubangi.  It is known from the Kasai and lower Congo River, but there is no record from the Uelle.</p>
				<p>The breeding of this plover has been studied in southern and eastern Africa, especially by Harris and by van Someren.<note n="1">1934, Journ. E. Afr. Ug. N. H. Soc., Nos. 49&ndash;50, pp. 185&ndash;187, 1 Pl.</note> The eggs are not easy to find because the sitting bird shuffles sand or earth over them as she leaves.  Two eggs form a set, creamy buff slightly tinged with greenish, thickly covered with irregular streaks and scrolls of very dark brown, and with underlying greenish-brown markings.  Dimensions: 28&ndash;33 mm. X 21&ndash;23.</p>

				<p><taxon><taxonName idx_name="Charadrius marginatus nigirius">C. m. nigirius</taxonName> Bates</taxon><note n="1">1932, B. B. O.

Professor Neumann regards all forms of <taxonName idx_name="Charadrius marginatus">C. marginatus</taxonName> as races of <taxonName idx_name="Charadrius alexandrinus">C. alexandrinus</taxonName>.</p>
				<p>In breeding plumage <taxonName idx_name="Charadrius marginatus mechowi">mechowi</taxonName> is readily distinguished from <taxonName idx_name="Charadrius marginatus marginatus">marginatus</taxonName> and <taxonName idx_name="Charadrius marginatus tenellus">tenellus</taxonName> by the narrower black area on its fore-crown.  This mark is usually smaller in females of <taxonName idx_name="Charadrius marginatus mechowi">mechowi</taxonName> than in males, and may be almost absent.  Two females from Moba on Lake Tanganyika do not differ from Congo River specimens, so I do not believe <taxonName idx_name="Charadrius marginatus tenellus">tenellus</taxonName> occurs in the eastern Congo.  A male of <taxonName idx_name="Charadrius marginatus mechowi">mechowi</taxonName> was collected by Dr. J.C. Phillips on Lake Edward, and a female by Father Moonz at Lusambo, Sankuru district.</p>
				<p>Though widely distributed in the Congo, this small plover is mainly restricted to the islands and banks of the larger rivers and the lakeshores. In the Uelle district we observed but two single birds, one at Faradje, the other on a bar in the Uelle River between Dungu and Niangara.  Never noticed in the Ituri forest, it was found rather commonly along the Congo River in the Bangala and Equator districts, at high water in December when they were not breeding, and also in March when the river was low.  In December they were in small parties, seldom exceeding six, and seemed to feed most actively at dusk.  Four stomachs were examined, and found to contain only insects, including one small grasshopper and the heads of many termites.</p>
				<p>Nesting takes place no doubt at low water, as Alexander<note n="3">1900, Ibis, pp. 452&ndash;454.</note> found with <taxonName idx_name="Charadrius marginatus tenellus">tenellus</taxonName> on the Zambesi.  Sets of three eggs were laid in the sand, and throughout the middle of the day were completely covered over, as if the heat of the sun were relied on for incubation during that time. The eggs were pale buffy-brown, minutely spotted and streaked with reddish-brown, and with purplish shell-markings.  Average dimensions 25.8 X 22.3 mm.</p>

				<p>SPECIMEN.&mdash;Penge, &male;, Apr. 27.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;Breeds from Cumberland Sound, Greenland, and the British Isles east to northeastern Siberia and Japan. Four races are admitted by Peters,<note n="1">1934, `Check-List,' II, p. 247.</note> but one of these is <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Charadrius semipalmatus">C. semipalmatus</taxonName> Bonaparte</taxon> of North America.  <taxonName idx_name="Charadrius hiaticula hiaticula">C. h. hiaticula</taxonName> nests in the Baltic countries, and migrates south into Africa, especially the western half, as far as the Cape.  The wing of this race measures 127&ndash;139 mm., whereas <taxonName idx_name="Charadrius hiaticula tundr&aelig;">C. h. tundr&aelig;</taxonName> has wings of 122&ndash;132 mm., usually under 129 mm.</p>
				<p>Only a single specimen in our Congo collection can be referred to the typical race.  It is an adult male taken on the northward migration, and its wing measures 134 mm.  The four other specimens from the Congo are all autumn birds in dull plumage which must be assigned to the Siberian race.  Friedmann has examined one specimen of typical <taxonName idx_name="Charadrius hiaticula hiaticula">hiaticula</taxonName> from Lake Edward, but most of the Congo references to <taxonName idx_name="Charadrius hiaticula">C. hiaticula</taxonName> are here placed in the synonymy of <taxonName idx_name="Charadrius hiaticula tundr&aelig;">tundr&aelig;</taxonName>, since that seems by far the commoner race in the Upper Congo.  The main migration route of the typical race is probably in West Africa.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;Breeds in Siberia and northern Scandinavia, and after its southward migration is apparently much more common in eastern and central Africa than typical <taxonName idx_name="Charadrius hiaticula hiaticula">hiaticula</taxonName>, likewise reaching South Africa.</p>
				<p>Ringed plovers, in the Upper Congo, do not travel in large flocks, but are more often seen in twos or fours, sometimes singly, and just as often in dry open spaces like village squares and pastures as along the
<pb n="68" id="t000120-p00074c.tif"/> shores of watercourses.  In the Ituri and Uelle the present species arrived about the middle of October; and probably the majority of the birds passed on to the southward, returning in small numbers at the time of the northern spring.  Their note was occasionally heard, and closely resembled that of <taxonName>Charadrius semipalmatus</taxonName>.  Their diet is evidently varied, for in the stomach of the Faradje specimen were found many freshly-hatched flies, a small beetle, several tiny clam-like bivalves, a very small snail, and a small millipede.</p>

				<p>The three-banded plover is more common about rivers and lakes than on the seacoast, and is not a sociable bird.

				<p>Its eggs are said to be laid in a slight hollow not far from water, and number two or occasionally three: yellowish or grayish white, thickly covered with zigzag lines of brown and blackish.

				<p>Nowhere does it seem very common, and none has yet been taken in the Upper Uelle or Ituri.  There is however one example in the Nairobi Museum collected by W.J. Eggeling at Butiaba on Lake Albert.  I failed to find it at Lukolela on the middle Congo River, though Johnston mentioned it as common above Stanley Pool, and Schouteden has reported it from Eala near Coquilhatville.  The Congo Museum now has a specimen from Buta.  Father Callewaert has sent us three males and a female from Luluabourg in the Kasai, all taken in January.  They are quite typical, with wings 125&ndash;134 mm.</p>
				<p>Rudyerd Boulton collected a female at Mombolo, Angola, August 9; and Dr. F. O. Stoehr obtained a specimen for the British Museum in Northeast Rhodesia in January.  Pakenham observed several near Kigoma in October.  Thus it seems certain that the species will be found in the Katanga Province.</p>
				<p>In West Africa it is said to frequent areas of short grass or bare ground, often near habitations, rather than muddy or sandy shores. Its call has been described as a short series of whistles, more or less high-pitched, like &quot;peeee&quot; or &quot;peeee ooh.&quot;  The nest remains to be discovered. Fairbairn<note n="1">1936, Nigerian Field, V, pp. 74&ndash;76.</note> believes that breeding takes place between April and June in Southern Nigeria.</p>

				<p>ADULTS.&mdash;Iris dark brown, bill black, feet brownish green or light grayish green.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;Breeds from the Kirghiz Steppes and eastern Persia to the Altai, and migrates to western India and Africa.  By many authors <taxon><taxonName>Charadrius veredus</taxonName> Gould</taxon> is regarded as a race of the same species, breeding in Mongolia and northern China, and migrating to the East Indies and Australia.</p>
				<p>In Africa <taxonName idx_name="Charadrius asiaticus">C. asiaticus</taxonName> winters abundantly in the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, visits the grasslands of eastern Africa, and even reaches Cape Province and Benguella.  It is not known from West Africa north of Angola, and must be wanting in the western Congo basin.</p>
				<p>Near Faradje, in the Upper Uelle, the Caspian plover appeared every year, but usually much later than other migrant shore-birds, for we would see it in January, February, and March, not so much near riverbanks as about well-worn pastures and even the vicinity of the cow-sheds. These plovers were most active toward sundown, feeding exclusively on insects&mdash;as shown by examination of seven stomachs.</p>
				<p>At Avakubi, in the Ituri forest, only a single individual was observed; it was walking on the bare surface of the parade ground in company
<pb n="72" id="t000120-p00078c.tif"/> with one of the smaller plovers, on February 16, 1914.  In the grasslands along the eastern Congo border it may be a little less common than in the Upper Uelle, though I saw a party of twelve near the old post of Kasindi, just north of Lake Edward, on January 30, 1927. Conover and Zimmer collected this plover for the Field Museum at Katobwe on the Lualaba River, but there are no records from the Kasai district.</p>

				<p>The European golden plover was reported from the Gaboon by Du Chaillu, but there seem to be no reliable records either from the west coast of Africa south of the Canary Islands, or from the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan.

				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;The gray plover or black-bellied plover breeds in northern Europe, Asia, and North America, and migrates southward to Brazil, Peru, Australia, and the Cape of Good Hope. A large subspecies, <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Squatarola squatarola hypomel&aelig;na">S. s. hypomel&aelig;na</taxonName> (Pallas)</taxon>, breeding in East Siberia, is commonly recognized, which migrates mainly toward Australia, but may sometimes reach Somaliland.<note n="1">See, however, Peters, 1934, Condor, XXXVI, pp. 27&ndash;29, and Low, 1938, Ibis, pp. 154&ndash;158.</note> The validity of a North American race has not been established.</p>
				<p>The typical European form migrates south in autumn along both coasts of Africa and occasionally wanders inland, so that it has occurred on the west side of Lake Victoria, and the Congo Museum has specimens from Buta in the Lower Uelle and Panga on the Aruwimi River. Mr. H. B. Conover tells me that he has secured it on the Lualaba River at Katobwe, near 9&Degree; S. latitude.  As it travels along the west coast, and has been collected near Landana by Falkenstein, it is sure to occur at the mouth of the Congo.  Near Lukolela, March 29, 1931, on a sand-bar
<pb n="73" id="t000120-p00079c.tif"/> in the middle Congo River, I myself saw a party of about twenty black-bellied plover.</p>

				<p>SPECIMENS.&mdash;Leopoldville, &female;, &male; im., Dec. 22.</p>
				<p>ADULT FEMALE.&mdash;Iris chrome-yellow with greenish gray inner rim; bill and feet blackish.  These colors are similar in the young male.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;From Natal northward to Kenya Colony, Uganda, the Semliki Valley, Kasai district, middle Congo River, and from the Lower Congo along the west coast to Sierra Leone, if not to the Gambia. Not known from the forests of the Cameroon and Congo, nor from south-western Africa.  Near Leopoldville I found it in the savanna country in late December, walking about in pairs and parties of four or five, on cultivated ground and in pastures.  When flushed they gave a short complaining call, which B&ouml;hm wrote as &quot;Tl&uuml;-iht.&quot;  The stomachs of both our specimens disclosed insects, especially beetles.</p>
				<p>At Lukolela I never saw it, though Dr. Schouteden has reported the species from Kwamouth and the country just south of Bolobo.  Father
<pb n="74" id="t000120-p00080c.tif"/> Callewaert procured several specimens at Luluabourg in the Kasai district between September and January.  On January 26, 1927, I noted about seven in the dry acacia woods at the south end of Ruwenzori, near Kasindi, feeding in patches where the grass had been burned.  It seems not to be migratory.</p>
				<p>Records from the highlands of Marungu and the Upper Katanga are wanting, but H. B. Conover tells me that he found this plain-colored lapwing at Katapena, south of Lake Upemba.  L&eacute;on Lippens collected one at Gabiro, Ruanda.</p>
				<p>Nests have been found in Natal (October), Southern Rhodesia (November), Tanganyika Territory (October), and the Cherangani district of Kenya Colony (April 15).  Four eggs found in ploughed land by Paget-Wilkes,<note n="1">1929, Ool. Rec., IX, p. 12.</note> were dull olivaceous brown, spotted with black and a little umber. Reichenow and Nehrkorn gave the dimensions of eggs as 35.5 X 26.5 mm. and 38 X 26 mm.</p>

				<p>The black-winged plover ranges from Arabia and Abyssinia through East Africa to Cape Province.  The species was first described by Cretzschmar from Djedda, Arabia; and as specimens from Kenya Colony southward have slightly shorter wings (usually less than 218 mm. long) and less extensive white foreheads, they have been separated under the name <taxonName idx_name="Stephanibyx melanopterus minor">minor</taxonName>.</p>
				<p>This plover was said to have been taken by Ansorge in Uganda, just northeast of Lake Edward, but examination of the specimen shows it to be <taxonName idx_name="Stephanibyx lugubris">S. lugubris</taxonName>.

				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;From Abyssinia and Somaliland south to Natal, Cape Province, and west to Mossamedes.  South African specimens have wings 194&ndash;209 mm., those from eastern Africa usually 182&ndash;205 mm.  These may all be assigned to the typical subspecies; but Abyssinian birds, and perhaps those from the Mau Escarpment, may be slightly larger, with wings 200&ndash;215 mm.  For the large birds of the north-eastern highlands Friedmann has proposed the name <taxonName idx_name="Stephanibyx coronatus suspicax">suspicax</taxonName>.<note n="1">1928, Proc. N. Eng. Zool. Cl., X, p. 95 (Sadi Malka, Abyssinia); 1930, Bull. 153, U. S. Nat. Mus., pp. 161&ndash;166.</note> On the other hand, British Somaliland seems to have a rather small race, <taxonName idx_name="Stephanibyx coronatus demissus">demissus</taxonName>,<note n="2">Friedmann, 1928, Proc. N. Eng. Zool. Cl., X, p. 97 (Suk-Soda, Somaliland).</note> with wings only 191&ndash;197 mm. and the back of more sandy-rufous color when the plumage is fresh.  This race may also extend to Italian Somaliland.</p>
				<p>In the eastern Congo <taxonName idx_name="Stephanibyx coronatus coronatus">S. c. coronatus</taxonName> lives on dry plains to the south of Lake Edward, in the lower Ruzizi Valley, and in the Katanga province. It is found in pairs or small flocks, often far from water, and is a strong runner.  The crowned lapwing is particularly fond of freshly burned grasslands, and has a loud, reiterated grating call.  Active and noisy at dusk, the birds even fly about and call on moonlit nights.  In South Africa the breeding season is stated to be from August to November, or even to February, and the nest a mere depression in the ground.  The three eggs are yellowish brown, blotched with blackish-brown and often with gray shell-markings, the blotches heaviest at the obtuse end.  Dimensions, 36&ndash;42 mm. &times; 27&ndash;30.</p>

				<p>ADULTS.&mdash;Iris grayish yellow to yellow; bill greenish black, eyelids and loral wattle yellow; feet dark brownish gray.</p>
				<p>IMMATURE MALE.&mdash;Iris light brown; loral wattle light brown, that around eye yellowish.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;From Togoland, Northern Nigeria, Bozum in French Equatorial Africa, and the Uelle district, east to the Kavirondo country and south to Mpala on Lake Tanganyika and Luluabourg in the Kasai district.  Despite its occurrence at several localities within the limits of the Congo forest, it seems to be only a transient there.  In the Ituri district, for example, it is seen even in favorable places only a few times each year, and undoubtedly is passing on migration.  Coming in flocks of as many as twenty-five, they announce themselves with a loud triple grating call, and alight on cleared ground, sometimes near riverbanks.</p>
				<p>At Avakubi a flock of about twenty adults, and perhaps one or two smaller groups, appeared on November 26, 1909, remaining but a day, and none were seen during the next eight months.  On July 27 of the following year, two were flying about the post of Medje, one of them immature. A single adult female, with ovary somewhat enlarged, was captured by natives near Niangara on January 3, 1911.</p>
				<p>In November, 1913, at Avakubi&mdash;just four years, to a day, from my first observation there&mdash;a flock of twenty-five came flying over a cleared
<pb n="77" id="t000120-p00083c.tif"/> field, and three days later there was another flock of ten.  A single individual was noted on December 29, and no more until August 8, 1914, when one was heard calling.</p>
				<p>Records of other collectors with dates from the same forested area of the eastern Congo are:  Beni, November 20 (Bonnevie); Ukaika, December (Grauer); lower Aruwimi River, July 30 and December 9 (Jameson).<note n="1">The record by Sharpe (1896) from &quot;Stanley Pool&quot; refers to a specimen from the Aruwimi River.</note> So there are two seasons of occurrence, July-August and November-December.  At the latter season the birds are all non-breeding adults, evidently moving toward their breeding area, while the July-August examples
<figure>

Zool., XXIX, p. 16.</note> likewise obtained an immature specimen in the Kavirondo district, August 22; but it is not young enough to indicate breeding there.  Instead, it is several months old, and has already molted most of its juvenal primaries.</p>
				<p>The only records I can find for the months when eggs should be laid are to the north of the forest belt:  Togoland, January 3 and 26; Zaria, Northern Nigeria, April 14; Buta in the Lower Uelle, April; Niangara, January 3; and Mauda, Upper Uelle, March 20.  In that region it would seem they must nest.</p>
				<pb n="78" id="t000120-p00084u.tif"/>
				<p>South of the Congo forest, where the birds may be expected to spend their off-season, there are only a few known occurrences, in July and August: Luluabourg, August 9; Komi in the Sankuru district, July; and Mpala, August.  From the Lower and Middle Congo there are no records.  Further investigation is needed, but I am convinced that this lapwing nests north of the forest belt,<note n="1">This prediction has already been fulfilled by J.D. Clarke (1936, Nigerian Field, V, pp. 72, 73). He watched the birds courting in southeast Ilorin Province, Nigeria, in early January and caught a young chick on February 27.  See also Heslop, 1937, Ibis, pp. 174, 175.</note> and migrates to the southeastern Congo.</p>

				<p>SPECIMENS.&mdash;Faradje, &male; im., Aug. 11; &female;, Nov. 30; &female; im., Aug. 11.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;From Cyprus and Palestine to Egypt, Arabia, eastern and central Africa, and west to Senegal.  In East Africa the spurwinged plover ranges south to the latitude of Zanzibar and Mwanza; and along the eastern Congo border it is common as far south as the southern shore of Lake Edward, while one specimen has been recorded from the northern end of Lake Tanganyika.  It is more partial to the vicinity of water than some of the other lapwings, and I have noted it at Kasenyi on Lake Albert, at Kasindi Landing, Katwe, and Kabare on Lake Edward, as well as along the lower Rutshuru River.</p>
				<p>There are no records from the Ubangi district, and the species is by no
<pb n="79" id="t000120-p00085c.tif"/> means common in the Uelle.  The equatorial forest seems to be the barrier limiting its range in the Congo, and even in the grasslands of the northeastern Uelle the three specimens collected were all we ever saw there.  They came in August and in November, alighting on bare patches of ground near the bank of the Dungu River at Faradje.  The stomachs of two of them showed that they had been feeding on insects, including a single insect-larva.</p>
				<p>I have little doubt that there was a bird of this species in the collection made by Cranch during the Tuckey Expedition, but it was doubtless secured somewhere in the western part of Upper Guinea, not in the Lower Congo.</p>

				</p>
				<p>The spur-winged plover is well known as a restless bird of river-banks and sand-bars, whose loud calls have won for it the Arab name of &quot;Ziczac.&quot; Though it has often been seen in the immediate vicinity of basking crocodiles, and said to enter the mouths of the great saurians, Heuglin thought that the real crocodile-bird&mdash;if it did have such an adventurous habit&mdash;was <taxonName>Pluvianus &aelig;gyptius</taxonName>.</p>
				<p>The nest of <taxonName>Hoplopterus spinosus</taxonName> is a slight hollow in the sand or earth containing three or four eggs.  The latter are pyriform or pointed oval, dull buff, frequently with a greenish tinge, and boldy marked with black or blackish-brown blotches and spots, thickest at the larger end.  There are also underlying markings of pale purplish.  Dimensions, 37&ndash;43 mm. &times; 27&ndash;30.5.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;From Natal and the Orange River north to southern Angola, the Upper Katanga, Lake Tanganyika, and Lake Nakuru in Kenya Colony.  Apparently rare in the southeastern Congo, but De Riemacker has collected three examples near the Luombwa and Kafubu rivers.</p>
				<p>The blacksmith plover, so named because of its metallic twin-syllabled call, lives in pairs or small flocks in the vicinity of lakes and rivers.  Its nest is a slight excavation in the bare ground not far from water, and is said sometimes to be lined with grass-roots.  The eggs number two to four, and are sandy buff or olive, generously sprinkled with small spots and larger blotches or scrawls of black or blackish brown.  Dimensions 38&ndash;41 mm. &times; 28&ndash;30.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;Senegal, Darfur, and Eritrea south to Natal, but wanting throughout the rain forests of West Africa and the Congo.  The typical race extends from Senegal across the grasslands north of the forest belt to Lake Albert, intergrading near the White Nile with <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Afribyx senegallus major">A. s. major</taxonName> Neumann</taxon><note n="1">1914, O.

				<pb n="81" id="t000120-p00087c.tif"/>
				<p>West African specimens of <taxonName idx_name="Afribyx senegallus senegallus">senegallus</taxonName> have wings about 210&ndash;232 mm., as compared with 231&ndash;258 in <taxonName idx_name="Afribyx senegallus major">major</taxonName>.  Our specimens from the Uelle are intermediate, wings 226&ndash;242 mm.</p>
				<p>South and east of the Congo forest lives <taxonName idx_name="Afribyx senegallus lateralis">A. s. lateralis</taxonName>, distinguished by the blackish coloring of its flanks.</p>
				<p>The savannas of the northern Congo, in the Uelle and doubtless the Ubangi district, are occupied by <taxonName idx_name="Afribyx senegallus senegallus">Afribyx s. senegallus</taxonName> during part of the year.  In addition to the three localities where we collected specimens, it was seen also a number of times at Niangara.  These wattled lapwings are not particularly attached to water, but prefer cultivated fields or open barren spaces, often in remote parts of the bush-country.  Here they
<figure>
						<figDesc>Fig. 8.  <taxonName idx_name="Afribyx senegallus senegallus">Afribyx s. senegallus</taxonName>.  &times; 2/3.</figDesc>
					</figure>  are found singly, in pairs, or families, usually four at most, taking wing at some distance with loud complaining calls, like a reiterated &quot;kip,&quot; and usually circling round with strong, measured wing-beats, at a safe distance. Another note not infrequently heard is imitated in the Mangbetu name of &quot;Ma-gil&iacute;-gil&iacute;.&quot;  They are rather active in the daytime, but especially so at sunset, while even at night&mdash;mostly when there is a bright moon&mdash;they are heard calling as they fly over.  The pairs undoubtedly nest about dry upland fields, but we did not find any eggs, though the appearance of rather young birds in April seemed sufficient to fix the period of nesting as February and March.</p>
				<pb n="82" id="t000120-p00088u.tif"/>
				<p>During the middle of the rainy season the birds disappear completely. They must migrate to the northward, since they are unknown in the forest, and southward are replaced by <taxonName idx_name="Afribyx senegallus lateralis">A. s. lateralis</taxonName>.  The earliest date of arrival we noted at Faradje was October 10, 1912, the latest date before departure June 20, 1912.  All the dates of occurrence in the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan given by Sclater and Mackworth-Praed fall within this same period; but in Darfur Admiral Lynes<note n="1">1925, Ibis, p. 568.</note> observed that this lapwing only spent the &quot;summer,&quot; and did not breed.</p>
				<p>In western Africa the nest has not been found, but two eggs of <taxonName idx_name="Afribyx senegallus major">A. s. major</taxonName> from Abyssinia, March 24, are described by Bannerman<note n="2">1931, `Birds Trop. W. Afr.,' II, p. 118.</note> as brownish buff, thickly spotted with black and chocolate-brown, these colors forming confluent blotches around the blunt end.  Dimensions, 47.5 &times; 32 mm. and 48.5 &times; 31.5 mm.</p>
				<p>To determine the food we examined eight stomachs, which were found to contain nothing but remains of insects and occasionally their larv&aelig;. Beetles with hard shells were most commonly eaten, and occasionally crickets.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;From Natal, Transvaal, and Damaraland north to Tanganyika Territory, Mt. Elgon, Masindi in Uganda, Lake Edward,
<pb n="83" id="t000120-p00089c.tif"/> Lualaba River, Kwango River, and Stanley Pool.  It apparently does not reach the central Kasai district, and certainly not the Ubangi.  A specimen of <taxonName idx_name="Afribyx senegallus lateralis">lateralis</taxonName>, listed by Oustalet (1893) and Reichenow (1900) as senegallus, was actually collected by Dybowski at Brazzaville, July 9, 1891.</p>
				<p>The wings in this race measure 220&ndash;241 mm.  Some specimens from the eastern Congo have the patches on the flanks a little less blackish than in those of southern Africa.  These patches are usually connected by a dusky band across the upper abdomen.</p>
				<p>In its conspicuous and noisy ways of life, this race agrees with typical <taxonName idx_name="Afribyx senegallus senegallus">senegallus</taxonName>.  Near Katwe and Kasindi on the north side of Lake Edward, and on the lower Rutshuru River, I saw about eight individuals, readily" identified as <taxonName idx_name="Afribyx senegallus lateralis">lateralis</taxonName> with the field-glass.  A few miles southwest of Luvungi in the Ruzizi Valley, July 14, a pair was found in open grassland. The female was collected and proved to have an egg in the oviduct.  In August the species was noted along the Lualaba River below Bukama. In South Africa it has been said to occur only as a migrant, from October to March, yet in Southern Rhodesia and Beira Province of Mozambique it breeds between August and November.  Dr. van Someren<note n="1">1935, Journ. E. Afr. Ug. N. H. Soc., XII, p. 20.</note> gives the breeding season in Uganda as August and September.  There may be two, three, or occasionally four eggs, laid in a simple depression in the ground.  These are of a pale olive-brown, spotted and blotched with black and brown, 43&ndash;50 mm. &times; 29.5&ndash;35.</p>

				<p>Along the main stream of the Congo, from Stanley Pool up to Stanley Falls, we often noticed the white-crowned lapwing, singly or in pairs, seldom in small parties, along the muddy river-bank or flying out ahead of the steamer with loud, shrill cries, and here and there on the broad sand-bars exposed at low water.  It must be equally common along the lower Congo, the lower Ubangi, and on the larger rivers of the Kasai district. Father Callewaert has sent us two specimens from Luluabourg. Although it has been taken occasionally in the Sudan, we never noticed it
<pb n="85" id="t000120-p00091u.tif"/> in the Upper Uelle district, nor along the Ituri and Aruwimi rivers as far down as Banalia.  Neither is it known from Uganda.  It differs radically from <taxonName>Afribyx senegallus</taxonName> in its fondness for the banks of broad watercourses, and especially those in the forest region.</p>
				<p>A spirited picture of the habits of the white-crowned lapwing, at a spot just above Stanley Pool, was given by Sir Harry Johnston (1884) in his `River Congo.'  He described the sprawling crocodiles and the birds that stood about them, very dissimilar creatures living in a strange intimacy. The lapwings were the first to give the alarm, and then flapped on black-and-white wings to another point along the shore, where they folded their attractive pinions under modest gray coverts, and strutted about the beach.</p>
				<p>The call of <taxonName>Xiphidiopterus albiceps</taxonName> is a sharp &quot;keep!&quot; or &quot;peep!&quot; which may be repeated many times.  It sometimes resembles the voice of the skimmer, <taxonName>Rynchops flavirostris</taxonName>; and since both in flight look black-and-white, it is not unnatural that the Mobangi people near Lukolela use the same name, &quot;Ndawle,&quot; for both birds.  Although resident through the whole year on the Congo River, this lapwing evidently nests only during the periods of low water.  On August 9 near Lukolela I collected a pair in non-breeding condition and molting remiges and rectrices.  Their wing-spurs were likewise about to shed the outer sheath, which could be lifted off, leaving a perfect new horny point beneath.</p>
				<p>The river was then low, and these two birds seemed to be losing a favorable opportunity to nest.  During the next period of low water, on February 10, a nest was discovered near the middle of a low sand-bar in the same section of the river.  It was a shallow pit scooped from rather hard sand, about six inches across, with three eggs.  The incubating bird was wary, but twice I watched it come back and settle down.  The eggs are dull brownish buff, rather thickly spotted with dark brown. Two of them are more heavily blotched at the blunt end.  Dimensions, 43.2 &times; 31, 43.7 &times; 30.6, and 44.3 &times; 30.8 mm.  In color and size these eggs agree well with a set of three from Nigeria described by Bannerman (1931, p. 112).</p>
				<p>That some individuals in the same region of the Congo do breed at the other period of low water, toward August, is proved by a young bird in juvenal dress, with remiges still in sheaths, which was collected in September, 1910, on the lower Ubangi River by the Second Expedition of the Duke of Mecklenburg.  The specimen is preserved in the Frankfort Museum.</p>
				<p>The stomachs of two examples from Lukolela contained insect-remains
<pb n="86" id="t000120-p00092c.tif"/> including one mantis, and a bone from a frog or fish.  Both birds had swallowed tiny pebbles as well.</p>

				<p>ADULT MALE.&mdash;Iris rather dull scarlet, becoming whitish on outer rim, margin of eyelids bright scarlet; basal half of bill light crimson or rose-color, distal portion blackish; soft skin of feet light purplish red, but all large scales on front and back of metatarsi and on toes blackish, as are the claws.</p>
				<p>ADULT FEMALE.&mdash;Similar, but iris red-brown or brownish red.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;From the upper White Nile and Bahr-el-Ghazal south through eastern Africa to the Zambesi and Zululand. The typical form, ranging south to Uganda and Lake Edward, has all the remiges dark-colored, with some white only at the bases of the secondaries on their inner webs.  A southern form, H. c. leucoptera (Reichenow), extending north to Mozambique, Nyasaland, and the Luapula River has all the remiges entirely white, with the exception of the innermost secondaries and outermost primaries.  The intervening region is occupied by a rather variable intermediate form, <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Hemiparra crassirostris hybrida">H. c. hybrida</taxonName> Reichenow</taxon>.</p>
				<p>Typical <taxonName idx_name="Hemiparra crassirostris crassirostris">crassirostris</taxonName> has been found on the western shore of Lake Albert by Grauer, one of whose specimens is in the American Museum. Some of the birds from Lake Edward certainly agree with those of the Bahr-el-Jebel, among them a male which I obtained at Kasindi Landing on the north shore in January, 1927, and two others collected by L. Lippens on the southwest shore.  From the remarks by Reichenow (1911) it would seem that he regarded his specimens from Lake Mohasi as <taxonName idx_name="Hemiparra crassirostris crassirostris">H.c. crassirostris</taxonName>, yet other writers have reported <taxonName idx_name="Hemiparra crassirostris hybrida">hybrida</taxonName> from the southern shore of Lake Edward.</p>
				<p>These long-toed lapwings do not enter the forested area of the Congo, and even about the lakes and rivers of the eastern border they are not numerous.  I have seen them only where there were extensive open marshes, usually with a great deal of floating vegetation such as <taxonName>Pistia</taxonName>. They are almost as much at home on the floating plants as lily-trotters (<taxonName>Actophilornis</taxonName>), walking about singly or in pairs.  Now and then they take wing, circle around, and give a loud clicking &quot;kick-k-k-k, kick-k-k-k&mdash;&quot;</p>

				<p>Their food consists of aquatic insects and maggot-like insect-larv&aelig;, dragon-fly nymphs, and small snails.  The plumage of <taxonName>Hemiparra</taxonName> exhales a musty odor recalling that of petrels.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;From the eastern and southern shores of L. Victoria and the south side of Lake Edward to Lake Upemba, Lake Rukwa, and possibly northern Nyasaland.  To judge from the remarks of Sassi and of L&ouml;nnberg, specimens from the southern shore of Lake Edward may be referred to this form.  The species seems to be rare in the highlands of the Upper Katanga, but this race does inhabit the marshes about lakes Kisale and Upemba.  Conover and Zimmer obtained it at Katobwe on the Lualaba near Lake Upemba.</p>

				<p>SPECIMEN.&mdash;Avakubi, &female;, Oct. 3.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;According to Peters (1934), from
<pb n="89" id="t000120-p00095c.tif"/> Iceland, northern Europe, northeastern Asia, Alaska and Virginia south to New Zealand, the Cape of Good Hope, and southern Chile.  He admits seventeen races, mostly of pied coloration but some black, following the conclusions of Stresemann.<note n="1">1927, O. Mb., pp. 71&ndash;77.</note> In some cases the black underparts of oyster-catchers indicate only a color-phase, black birds mating with pied. It must be admitted that the black moquini of South Africa and meadewaldoi of the Canaries are closely allied to the white-bellied oyster-catchers of Europe and Asia, though there are very distinct black species in Australia and southern South America.</p>
				<p>In Europe there are four pied races of <taxonName idx_name="H&aelig;matopus ostralegus">ostralegus</taxonName>.  <taxon><taxonName idx_name="H&aelig;matopus ostralegus ostralegus">H. o. ostralegus</taxonName> Linn&aelig;us</taxon>, usually with rather thin, pointed bill, breeds from Scandinavia to Spain, the northeast Mediterranean, and Black Sea.  <taxon><taxonName idx_name="H&aelig;matopus ostralegus malacophaga">H. o. malacophaga</taxonName> Salomonsen</taxon>,<note n="2">1930, Ibis, p. 58 (Thorsa, Iceland).</note> of Iceland and the F&auml;roes, is supposedly somewhat longer-winged, and its bill slightly deeper.  <taxon><taxonName idx_name="H&aelig;matopus ostralegus occidentalis">H. o. occidentalis</taxonName> Neumann</taxon>,<note n="3">1929, Gefiederte Welt, Heft 14, p. 161; 1932, Anz. Orn. Ges. Bayern II, p. 148 (Auskerry, Orkney Is.).</note> of the British Isles, has the bill in adults still deeper and more truncate. <taxon><taxonName idx_name="H&aelig;matopus ostralegus longipes">H. o. longipes</taxonName> Buturlin</taxon> occupies the inland area between the Dnieper and Yenisei rivers, and has a rather long, slender bill, while its metatarsus is longer than in the three preceding forms.</p>
				<p>Eastern Asia is occupied by <taxon><taxonName idx_name="H&aelig;matopus ostralegus osculans">H. o. osculans</taxonName> Swinhoe</taxon>, with a very large bill and metatarsus as long as in <taxonName idx_name="H&aelig;matopus longipes">longipes</taxonName>.  This race is not expected to reach Africa on migration, nor are <taxonName idx_name="H&aelig;matopus ostralegus malacophaga">malacophaga</taxonName> and <taxonName idx_name="H&aelig;matopus ostralegus occidentalis">occidentalis</taxonName>.</p>
				<p>The oyster-catchers which migrate down the West African coast to Senegal and the Gambia are supposedly <taxonName idx_name="H&aelig;matopus ostralegus ostralegus">H. o. ostralegus</taxonName>, and specimens referred to the same form have been taken along the Red Sea and the coast of East Africa as far south as Mozambique.  Recently H. Grote<note n="4">1930, Mitt. Zool. Mus. Berlin, XVI, p. 99.</note> has pointed out that <taxonName idx_name="H&aelig;matopus ostralegus longipes">H. o. longipes</taxonName> also winters on the coasts of the Red Sea and northern Somaliland.  One scarcely expects to find oyster-catchers far inland, but as Grote<note n="5">1931, J. f. O., pp. 346&ndash;349.</note> has reported, <taxonName idx_name="H&aelig;matopus ostralegus longipes">longipes</taxonName> often breeds along fresh water and inland lakes.</p>
				<p><taxonName idx_name="H&aelig;matopus ostralegus occidentalis">H. o. occidentalis</taxonName> and <taxonName idx_name="H&aelig;matopus ostralegus ostralegus">ostralegus</taxonName> are often difficult to distinguish. Both have the metatarsus about 47&ndash;51 mm., though Hartert gave the maximum as 56 mm.  Their bills vary from 60&ndash;87 mm., but the majority are less than 80 mm.  <taxonName idx_name="H&aelig;matopus ostralegus longipes">H. o. longipes</taxonName> is a well-marked race, with bills 72&ndash;90 mm. and metatarsus 52&ndash;60.</p>
				<p>Possibly the individual which Colonel Meinertzhagen<note n="6">1922, Ibis, p. 74.</note> noted at Entebbe on Lake Victoria, March 20, was really <taxonName idx_name="H&aelig;matopus ostralegus longipes">longipes</taxonName>, and I think there
<pb n="90" id="t000120-p00096c.tif"/> can be no doubt as to the" identification of our specimen from Avakubi. It seems to be a second-year bird in autumn plumage, with a white spot on the throat, and the feathering of the back brown and abraded.  Its wing measures 255 mm., exposed culmen 80 mm., and metatarsus 56 mm.</p>
				<p>It was a great surprise to find this bird feeding along the bank of the Ituri River in a heavily forested area.  Doubtless it does not often reach the northeastern Congo, but in view of the Lake Victoria record the occurrence cannot be called purely accidental.  The stomach of our specimen contained insects and a millipede.  Like many of the shore-birds arriving in central Africa at the same season, this one was decidedly lean.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;Southern Europe to India and China, Africa and Madagascar.  It seems probable that specimens from Madagascar and South Africa have slightly shorter wings and metatarsi than those of Europe and northern Africa.<note n="1">See Friedmann, 1930, Bull. 153, U. S. Nat. Mus., p. 181; and Roberts, 1932, Ostrich, III p. 102.</note>
				</p>
				<p>The black-winged stilt occurs throughout most of Africa except in the forests of the west and of the Upper Congo.  While many must be migrants from the north, the species breeds in Northeast Africa, Kenya Colony, along the Loangwa River,<note n="2">Neave, 1907, Mem. Proc. Manchester Lit. Phil. Soc., LI, No. 10, p. 14.</note> and in South Africa.  Thus far the Congo records are almost all from the eastern sections.  I have unpublished reports of one killed at Kikondja on Lake Kisale, October 17, by Rodhain and Bequaert, and another collected by H. B. Conover at Katobwe on the Lualaba.</p>
				<p>In the central Congo basin the stilt is altogether wanting, as it seems to be in the Kasai district.  We saw but a single example in the Uelle district, which was secured on a sand-bar in the River Dungu, and was doubtless a migrant from the north.  About Lake Edward stilts are abundant.  At Katwe, for instance, in January, I have seen approximately 900, mostly wading in a shallow brackish pond.  Among them were a score or two with pure white head and neck.  I noticed a few at Kabare in May.  Specimens are said to have been taken on Lake Edward in June and July, but L&eacute;on Lippens tells me that in his experience stilts are present there only from the beginning of September to the middle of May.  He is convinced that they do not nest there.  They seem not to frequent highland lakes like Kivu or Bunyoni.  The occurrence of the stilt in the coastal region of the Gaboon, as well as at Landana, suggests that it may be found also in the Lower Congo.</p>
				<p>The four eggs of the stilt are laid either in a nest of rushes built in a swamp or in a slight hollow on a bare stream-bank or sand-bar.  They are somewhat pyriform, cream-color to very pale brown, usually tinged with greenish, and spotted and blotched with blackish brown.  Dimensions, 38.8&ndash;47.9 mm. &times; 28&ndash;34.8.  Neave found a nest on the Loangwa River on June 25.  The American Museum has a fledgling from Korole, Kenya Colony, with remiges only partly grown, which was taken on July 27.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;Europe and Asia to Mongolia and India; also widely but locally distributed in Africa, south to Cape Province, and occasionally on Madagascar.  In Africa the avocet is found mainly along the coasts, but also about the highland lakes of East and Northeast Africa, especially those that are brackish.  Along the west coast it has been taken in Togoland, near the base of Mt. Cameroon, and at Mossamedes; but Tuckey&apos;s record from the lower Congo River needs confirmation. There is always a possibility that the specimen was taken on the voyage out, and not in the Congo.</p>
				<p>On the west coast north of the equator the avocet is merely a rare migrant from the north; but in East Africa it is resident, and undoubtedly breeds, as it does in South Africa.  Possibly it may wander occasionally to the lakes along the eastern Congo border.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;After nesting on the northern coasts of Asia, curlew-sandpipers migrate through Europe and Asia as far as Australia and South Africa.  Migrants are most commonly seen passing through the Upper Congo in September, when they may drop in upon any open ground, often in villages, but never in any great number.</p>
				<pb n="94" id="t000120-p00100c.tif"/>
				<p>Some arrive in South Africa even in August, others spend the winter in the Congo, and have been taken on the Aruwimi and at Kwamouth in December.  Near Lukolela I noted a party of eight on March 22.  A few must even remain in Africa during the northern summer, since they have been reported from Lake Edward in June and July.</p>

				<p>After breeding in the arctic regions, the knot travels southward to Tierra del Fuego, Australia, New Zealand, India, and Africa.

				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;From its breeding grounds, northern France and Scandinavia to the Kolyma River in Siberia, the ruff migrates to India and the Cape of Good Hope, some reaching South Africa as early as August.  Only traces, at most, of the nuptial dress, are generally to be noticed upon males taken in Africa.  They have the appearance therefore of large plain-colored sandpipers, about one-fourth larger than females of the same species.</p>
				<p>Ruffs seem to avoid, for the most part, the forest areas of the Congo. When seen in the Uelle and Ituri, they are usually single and not shy, quite silent, walking upon expanses of open ground in villages or near marshes.  Few winter north of the equator, but there are records in November from Lake Edward and the southern Kasai, in December from Elisabethville, and January 1 from Malela on the lower Congo.  In January and March, I noted ruffs on Lake Edward and along the Rutshuru River, and at Lukolela on March 22 a couple on a sand-bar in the Congo River.</p>

				<p>The sanderling breeds in the arctic regions of both hemispheres, migrating southward to southern Chile, Australia, India, Madagascar, and Africa.  In the last-named continent it reaches the Cape Province, but is seldom seen away from sea-coasts, though occurrences have been reported at Khartoum, Bukoba on Lake Victoria, and Lake Nakuru. There are numerous records from along the western coast, including the Gaboon, Portuguese Congo, and southern Angola; so it may be taken for granted that the species occurs regularly at the mouth of the Congo. The record from the Lubumbashi River in the Upper Katanga, October 20, is remarkably far inland.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;The common sandpiper breeds from the British Isles to Japan, north about to the Arctic Circle and south to the Mediterranean and Kashmir.  On its migrations it reaches Australia and the Cape Province of South Africa, yet some individuals winter as far north as the Mediterranean and the Red Sea.  The lengthy list of references for the Congo proves that there, too, it is a most common sandpiper.  It would be superfluous for me to add all the localities at which I have seen it.</p>
				<p>Of its nesting in tropical Africa I am still skeptical.  The van Somerens<note n="1">1910, `Studies of Bird Life in Uganda,' p. 10, Pl. X.</note> have published a photograph taken in Uganda of a bird supposedly sitting on its nest, and Colonel Meinertzhagen,<note n="2">1919, Ibis, p. 388.</note> too, reported young
<pb n="97" id="t000120-p00103c.tif"/> common sandpipers with their parents on the Kagiado River in Kenya Colony.  A female specimen taken on June 19, 1906, was listed by van Someren;<note n="1">1916, Ibis, p. 201.</note> and Hartert,<note n="2">1886, J. f. O., p. 608.</note> too, collected one at Loko on the Benue River in June.  Exceptional occurrences like these last are known in the case of other northern shore-birds.</p>
				<p>The astonishingly early arrival of birds from the north has often led to the assumption that they had bred near the equator.  On Lake Albert I have noted them at Butiaba on August 9 and at Kasenyi on August 10. Near 7&Degree; south latitude B&ouml;hm found the common sandpiper along the Lufuku River on August 4, and I have observed it at Ankoro on the Lualaba on August 7.  At Avakubi on the Ituri, 1&Degree; 20&prime; north latitude, I have seen them on July 21, and at Mobeka on the middle Congo, on July 25.  Here they are not even suspected of breeding.</p>
				<p>From this time on, until as late as April 28, they remain in the region and almost give the impression of a resident species.  In May and June, however, not a single bird ever came to my notice.  During their long stay in Africa, these sandpipers are to be found from sea-level up to 6000 feet along the banks of almost every river even though wooded, or around any lake or open marshy spot, usually in small numbers, often singly.  Their habits are closely similar to those of the American spotted sandpiper, even to the &quot;teetering,&quot; but the scaling flight is perhaps less pronounced, and the shrill &quot;tweet-tweet&quot; not so loud.</p>
				<p>At Avakubi, we noted that while the individuals were widely scattered during the day, they gathered at sundown into parties of three to a dozen, and then flew down the river to roost on rocks in rapids.  Very early in the morning they might be seen going up again, and on these journeys they flew very low over the water, often spread out in a straight line.  I once witnessed an amusing duel between common sandpipers on a log, the two birds going at each other like young cocks, pecking mostly at the feathers of the opponent&apos;s neck.</p>
				<p>Of three stomachs examined, two contained the hard shells of insects, mingled with small stones; the third held fly-maggots.</p>

				<p>The common redshank breeds in the Pal&aelig;arctic Region, migrating south to Africa, India, and the Malay countries.

				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;Northern Europe and Asia, from Scotland to Kamchatka; south in winter to New Zealand, Tasmania, India, Madagascar, and the Cape Province in Africa.  The greenshank travels not only along the eastern and western coasts of Africa, but also through the Nile Valley, and visits the larger lakes of the eastern half of Africa.  It also frequents the main stream of the Congo-Lualaba, as it does the larger rivers of West Africa.</p>
				<p>This large tattler is almost never seen along the lesser streams in the Upper Congo, and is not a sociable bird.  Mr. Berlioz writes me that Dybowski&apos;s specimen came from Ouadda on the Ubangi River.  In December I have observed the greenshank between Stanley Pool and Kwamouth, and on February 9 and April 3 saw single individuals on sand-bars near Lukolela.  H. B. Conover collected it at Katobwe on the Lualaba River, and Dr. J.C. Phillips obtained a specimen on Lake Edward as late

				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;The marsh sandpiper breeds in southeastern Europe, Turkestan, and southern Siberia, migrating to Australia, India, and South Africa.  It is widely distributed in Africa, some wintering as far north as the Sudan, others reaching the Cape Province, and is not restricted to the coasts, but occurs in the Nile Valley and about the lakes of the eastern half of tropical Africa.  Like the greenshank, however, it does not find the smaller rivers of the Upper Congo suited to its needs.</p>
				<p>Lang and I did not meet with it during our first expedition, but it is not uncommon about Lake Edward, and Conover found it at Katobwe on the Lualaba River.  Rockefeller and Murphy collected a male in breeding dress at Moba on Lake Tanganyika as late as May 22.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;Breeds in northern Europe and Asia, migrating to India, Australia, and South Africa.  In the northeastern Congo, in savanna and forest country alike, it is a rather common bird along the rivers from September to March; and, as our first record proves, it may even be seen in August.  It winters throughout the whole colony, as shown by the published records, except on the very high mountains.  Nevertheless, Rockefeller and Murphy obtained one at 7050 feet, at Kasengala in Marungu; and at slightly lower elevation Dr. J.C. Phillips secured specimens on lakes Chahafi and Mutanda, northeast of the Kivu Volcanoes.  On the Lualaba River Mr. Conover collected the wood-sandpiper at Katobwe, and I noted two on the middle Congo near Lukolela on March 22.</p>
				<p>In the Congo the wood-sandpiper is not particularly fond of woods, but is found usually in open or grassy spots near marshes and watercourses, or on bars in rivers at low water.  It reminded me strongly of our American solitary sandpiper, <taxon><taxonName>Tringa solitaria</taxonName> Wilson</taxon>.<note n="1">Bocage (1881, `Orn. Angola,' pt. 2, p. 468) recorded one specimen of the American solitary sandpiper, under the name <taxon><taxonName>Totanus chloropygius</taxonName> Vieillot</taxon>, as having been taken by Anchieta at Cabinda, close to the Congo mouth.

				<p>In the Congo, as a rule, this sandpiper is seen in small numbers along the rivers.  We noted it on the Uelle, the Dungu, and the Ituri, and more
<pb n="103" id="t000120-p00109c.tif"/> recently I have seen it at Irumu, on the north shore of Lake Edward, and on the Rutshuru River.  Wooded banks are not distasteful to it, and it may be seen feeding about water-soaked logs even where overhung by forest trees.  At Lukolela I have flushed it from a muddy pool in a forest swamp.  In flight the dark wings serve to distinguish it from the wood-sandpiper; both species are usually silent.</p>

L&eacute;on Lippens tells me that he observed one near the outlet of Lake Edward.</p>
				<p>Along the West Coast whimbrels occur in numbers, especially in Sierra Leone.  They reach the islands in the Gulf of Guinea, and the coast of Southwest and South Africa.  A single specimen was collected by van der Kellen at Banana, where they are probably not at all uncommon.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;Breeds in Europe and northern Asia.  The typical race makes its home from Ireland to northern Russia and Dobrudja.  <taxonName idx_name="Numenius arquata orientalis">N. a. orientalis</taxonName>, of lighter color and with bill averaging longer, nests from western Siberia to Transbaikalia.  <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Numenius arquata suschkini">N. a. suschkini</taxonName> Neumann</taxon>,<note n="1">1929, O.

				<p>Females usually have longer bills than males.  Disregarding sexual difference, the bill has been found to measure 110&ndash;166 mm. in <taxonName idx_name="Numenius arquata arquata">arquata</taxonName>, 134&ndash;184 mm. in <taxonName idx_name="Numenius arquata orientalis">orientalis</taxonName>, and 118&ndash;139 mm. in <taxonName idx_name="Numenius arquata suschkini">suschkini</taxonName>.</p>
				<p><taxonName idx_name="Numenius arquata arquata">N. a. arquata</taxonName> migrates southward along both eastern and western coasts of Africa, as far as the Cape Province, and to some extent up the Nile.  It also reaches Madagascar.  Occurrences at Chinchoxo and Ambriz prove that this curlew must be found near Banana.  Some records of the species farther inland are based on individuals of this race, as for instance one from Leopoldville (Van Delft) in the Congo Museum. It has the wing 286 mm. long, culmen 126 mm., and appeared to me to be a male of <taxonName idx_name="Numenius arquata arquata">N. a. arquata</taxonName>.

				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;The eastern curlew breeds in the southern Baikal region, Dauria, and West Siberia, and is known to migrate south to the Philippines, the Greater Sunda Islands, Madagascar, and Walfish Bay in Southwest Africa.  Inasmuch as it has been taken on the Niger, in Sierra Leone, and on the Gold Coast, it may be expected to occur near the Congo mouth.  Records from the White Nile suggested that it might also reach the eastern Congo.</p>
				<p>In recent years Brother Joseph Hutsebaut has collected two examples near Buta, Lower Uelle district, which are in the Congo Museum.  That they belong to this race is clear from their nearly pure white axillaries, and upper tail-coverts white with dark streaks but only a few bars, at most, on the inner webs of the longest central coverts.  The larger of the two was sexed as a female, and was taken on September 10; the other, not sexed, may be a male.  Wings, 292, 298 mm.; bills, 152, 174.  L&eacute;on Lippens observed the curlew at Vitshumbi on Lake Edward, but did not secure a specimen.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;Europe and northwest Asia, south in winter to Nigeria and Cape Province.  Widely distributed in eastern equatorial Africa during this migration, in small numbers even in the forested area of the Upper Congo.  Like the two following species, the great snipe is usually found in marshy spots, but flushing without any vocal noise, so far as I could observe.  A single bird was found at Faradje in a dry field.</p>
				<p>South of the forest belt, at Luluabourg, Father Callewaert obtained two of these snipe on December 2 and 11; and others have been reported from the Upper Katanga.  It seems likely, therefore, that the species will be found throughout the eastern half of our area, except on the higher mountains.  September 7 is the earliest date of arrival in the Congo, but records during the northward migration are wanting.

				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;In the breeding season from Iceland, the British Isles, and the Pyrenees to Japan and the Kurile Islands. <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Capella delicata">C. delicata</taxonName> Ord</taxon> of North America is so closely allied that it has sometimes been regarded as a race.</p>
				<p><taxon><taxonName idx_name="Capella gallinago faeroeensis">C. g. faeroeensis</taxonName> (C.L. Brehm)</taxon> of Iceland and the F&auml;roes does not migrate beyond Great Britain.  <taxonName idx_name="Capella gallinago gallinago">C. g. gallinago</taxonName>, which occupies the remainder of the breeding range, migrates southward to India, Borneo, and Africa at least to the equator, and in eastern Africa to Mombasa and Tanganyika Territory.  It is not yet known from south of the Congo forest belt; the snipe collected by Whyte on the upper Shire River and formerly referred to <taxonName idx_name="Capella gallinago">gallinago</taxonName> has proved to be <taxonName idx_name="Capella nigripennis">nigripennis</taxonName>.</p>
				<p>While wintering in the northern Congo the common snipe chooses the very same haunts as the great or &quot;double&quot; snipe, and is flushed from the borders of marshy spots in the savanna near river-banks, in pastures or other clearings in the forested regions.  In life I could not distinguish between the three species of <taxonName>Capella</taxonName> observed; more than two or three individuals were never found together, and they appeared to be more common toward November and again in March and April than during the middle of the northern winter.</p>
				<p>In our small series of Congo specimens the variation in length of bill is even greater than the figures usually given; those of the three males: 66.5, 69, and 77 mm., of the four females: 69&ndash;73 mm.  The three males have the dusky bars on the axillaries largely interrupted or wanting; so that these feathers are much whiter than in the females.  The latter have them regularly barred as in both sexes of <taxonName idx_name="Capella media">C. media</taxonName>.</p>

				<p>SPECIMEN.&mdash;Faradje, &male;, Apr. 16.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;Resident in South and East Africa, from Cape Province north to Abyssinia, and west to the Upper Uelle district and Angola.  Rare within our limits, except in the eastern highlands, and unknown in the lowland forests of the Congo.  A supposed record from Basoko, November 16, by R.E. Dent was due to misidentification of a skin of <taxonName idx_name="Capella media">C. media</taxonName>.</p>
				<p>Our single example of the Ethiopian snipe was shot in a grassy marsh, and was not in breeding condition.  Its bill measures 83 mm., exceeding the maxima for <taxonName idx_name="Capella media">C. media</taxonName> and <taxonName idx_name="Capella gallinago">C. gallinago</taxonName>.  Its axillaries are nearly pure white, and its outermost pair of rectrices extremely narrow.  The white outer web of the outermost primary is also characteristic.</p>
				<p>Another specimen of <taxonName idx_name="Capella nigripennis">C. nigripennis</taxonName> has been collected by Dr. Schouteden at Djalasinda near Mahagi.  On the Kivu Volcanoes in February, Count Gyldenstolpe found them more numerous:</p>
				<p>&quot;On the highest point of the saddles between Muhavura and Mgahinga, and between Mgahinga and Sabinio there were some open, swampy patches of ground covered with high grass, and on these places Snipe were rather abundant.</p>
				<p>&quot;Especially in the saddle between the latter two mountains they were quite numerous and offered good sport.  Besides the present three birds, several more were shot for the pot.  All the specimens obtained belonged to the above-mentioned race, and not a single individual of the common European form was met with.&quot;</p>
				<p>At Lukumi, near 12,000 feet on Mt. Karisimbi, L&eacute;on Lippens also saw about twenty of these snipe in May.</p>
				<p><taxonName>Capella nigripennis</taxonName> is certainly to be expected in the Upper Katanga; and at Lake Suse in southern Marungu, Rockefeller and Murphy collected an adult male on March 23.  They found this snipe common on
<pb n="109" id="t000120-p00115c.tif"/> swampy ground near the lake.  We have no records from the lowlands of the Kasai district.</p>
				<p>In South Africa they were found breeding by Layard and by Ayres in August and September, whereas in Abyssinia Cheesman<note n="1">1935, Ibis, p. 303.</note> noted nests with three eggs on July 7 and September 10, during the heavy rains.  The nests are built in grass-tussocks, and the eggs are olive-buff spotted and blotched, chiefly at the obtuse end, with two or three shades of dark brown.  Dimensions 41&ndash;44.5 mm. &times; 30&ndash;31.7.</p>
				<p>During the breeding season these snipe fly over the marshes, rising and falling, and at each descent make a whirring noise repeated six times, which Cheesman compares to the wing-beat of a swan in the distance.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;From Egypt and the Blue Nile to Senegal, south through West Africa to the River Kwanza, but on the White Nile scarcely south of Nimule.  Strangely enough, <taxonName>Pluvianus &aelig;gyptius</taxonName> has never been recorded from any of the great lakes of Africa.</p>
				<p>The typical race of Egypt and the Sudan west to Senegal, has wings measuring 130&ndash;144 mm.  In Angola and the southern Congo, <taxonName idx_name="Pluvianus &aelig;gyptius angol&aelig;">P. &aelig;. angol&aelig;</taxonName> has shorter wings: 125&ndash;131 mm.  The species is rare in the forested belt of the Congo and one might expect that the northern Congo would be occupied by the same race as the Sudan.  Some specimens from the northern Congo are probably large enough to be referred to <taxonName idx_name="Pluvianus &aelig;gyptius &aelig;gyptius">P. &aelig;. &aelig;gyptius</taxonName>.  Our four skins from the Uelle district, however, have wings only 128.5&ndash;134 mm., so that, while somewhat intermediate, they are better referred to <taxonName idx_name="Pluvianus &aelig;gyptius angol&aelig;">angol&aelig;</taxonName>.  The largest bird is a male from Niangara. Six adults in the Congo Museum from Libenge on the Ubangi River have wings 128&ndash;134 mm.</p>

				<p>ADULTS.&mdash;Iris dark brown; bill black with a little light green just above nostril, and some light blue beneath base of mandible; feet light blue, claws black.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;<taxonName>Pluvianus &aelig;. angol&aelig;</taxonName> extends from the Kwanza and Kwango rivers to the Kasai district, the Congo River at least from Leopoldville to Lukolela, as well as the Ubangi and Uelle rivers.  It is not known from the heavily forested section of the Congo River, but the Ubangi may serve as a line of communication between the northern and southern savanna districts.  Three specimens from northern Cameroon were said by Mrs. Meinertzhagen to have wings of 126&ndash;130 mm., really nearer <taxonName idx_name="Pluvianus &aelig;gyptius angol&aelig;">angol&aelig;</taxonName> than to <taxonName idx_name="Pluvianus &aelig;gyptius &aelig;gyptius">&aelig;gyptius</taxonName>.</p>
				<p><taxonName>Pluvianus</taxonName> is not a very common bird along the middle Congo River. None was noted in the Ituri district, and the specimens secured were practically all that we saw while in the Uelle district.  Very plover-like in behavior, they were found on the banks or sandy islets along large rivers, such as the Dungu, Uelle, and Congo.  Except for a low, hoarse &quot;chack&quot; repeated several times, we heard no sound from them.  Other observers have reported a longer series of notes, higher in pitch.</p>
				<p>The crocodile-bird or Egyptian plover has long been famous for its supposed habit of entering the open mouths of sleeping crocodiles, perhaps to remove parasites such as leeches.  Certainly <taxonName>Pluvianus</taxonName> betrays no fear in the immediate vicinity of crocodiles, yet few recent observers claim to have seen it pick food from the gaping jaws.  Brehm stated that he had repeatedly watched the operation; but Flower<note n="1">1908, Avicul. Mag., (2) VI, pp. 139&ndash;144.</note> has cast very serious doubts upon any such behavior.  Three stomachs which we examined contained in each case insect-remains, with the addition in one case of small stones, in another of small millet-like seeds.</p>
				<p>Along the Nile, the crocodile bird lays two to four eggs, and the incubating bird covers its eggs with sand.<note n="2">Reichenow, 1900, `V&ouml;g. Afr.,' I, p. 152; Hawker, 1902, Ibis, p. 457; &quot;B,&quot; 1918, Sudan Notes, I, p. 162; Koenig, 1926, J. f. O., Sonderheft, pp. 139&ndash;145.</note> They are light to deep buff, speckled and flecked with gray and reddish browns, 29&ndash;35 mm. &times; 23&ndash;25. Not only the eggs, but also the young chicks, are buried in the sand, and the parents sometimes moisten the sandy covering by regurgitating water over it.<note n="3">Butler, 1931, Ibis, pp. 345&ndash;347; 1932," idem, p. 163.</note> Breeding is carried on during the dry season, or when the rivers are lowest.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;From Senegal east to Sennar and Abyssinia, then south through eastern Africa to Natal and eastern Cape Colony, and west again&mdash;south of the equatorial forests&mdash;to the Kasai district, the coast of Angola, and Damaraland.  Besides the typical race, occupying most of this territory, there is a somewhat paler one, <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Cursorius temminckii damarensis">C. t. damarensis</taxonName> Reichenow</taxon>, in Southwest Africa.</p>
				<p>Temminck&apos;s courser shuns the entire forested region of the Congo, and has been found only in the eastern and southern savannas.  Schouteden collected it at the north end of Lake Albert, and it is not uncommon about the shores of Lake Edward, where I, too, have seen it near Kasindi. There are no records from the higher plateaus of the Kivu district; but it seems to be widespread in the grasslands from Lake Tanganyika to the Kasai, also in the southern Katanga.  H. B. Conover collected specimens for the Field Museum at Katobwe on the Lualaba, and Father Callewaert sent us two from Luluabourg.  One taken on October 8 retains most of its juvenal plumage.  Occurrences at Chinchoxo and in the Gaboon indicate that it must cross the Lower Congo.</p>
				<p>This courser is found in pairs or small parties on open ground, preferably in sandy spots or where the grass has been burned.  Somewhat plover-like in appearance, it is a rapid runner, but often fairly tame.  Two eggs are laid during the dry season on the bare ground.  They have been described as whitish or buff with gray shell-markings and thick scrawlings of dark brown.  Dimensions, 26&ndash;31 mm. &times; 21.5&ndash;24.5.<note n="1">Reichenow, 1900, `V&ouml;g.

				<p>SPECIMEN.&mdash;Garamba, &female; juv., Mar. 14.</p>
				<p>This bird in juvenal plumage, with wings only two-thirds grown, shows an extremely close resemblance to the adult, although the blackish breast band is narrower, and the brown feathers of chest and back are varied with faint light-and-dark edgings.  Even the violet-and-green metallic tips are present on the primaries.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;From Senegal and northern Cameroon across the Sudan to Sennar and Bogosland, then south through eastern Africa to the Cape Province and west to Angola and the Portuguese Congo.  The typical race occupies the northern part of the range; and it is doubtful whether the specimen recorded from Kabare on Lake Edward belongs with the northern form, or with <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Rhinoptilus chalcopterus albofasciatus">R. c. albofasciatus</taxonName> Sharpe</taxon>, which is perhaps slightly darker on the upperparts.</p>
				<p>Coursers shun heavily forested regions, and even in the savannas of the Uelle are all but unknown.  Our single specimen of <taxonName idx_name="Rhinoptilus chalcopterus chalcopterus">R. c. chalcopterus</taxonName> was taken at Garamba, on the Sudan border, in March; yet a stay of several months in that neighborhood, from May to July, failed to reveal any further specimens.  It seems that the breeding season in the Bahr-el-Ghazal Province and northern Uganda falls in the dry months of February and March, and the northern bronze-wing courser may withdraw from the northern Congo border during the rains.</p>
				<p>The peculiar habits of this courser were well described by A. L. Butler,<note n="2">1908, Ibis, p. 263.</note> who observed it between Chak Chak and the Pongo River, Bahr-el-Ghazal.  On February 9 he flushed three pairs in savanna woods, where they lay till almost trodden on, then rose with twisting flight.  Again at the same spot, late in the evening of March 19, he
<pb n="115" id="t000120-p00121c.tif"/> found a female with an egg almost ready to be laid.  Early the following morning a second female, non-breeding, was secured.  He concluded that their habits were crepuscular and nightjar-like.</p>
				<p>Captain Pitman<note n="1">1932, Ool. Rec., XI, pp. 18, 21.</note> obtained a set of three well-incubated eggs on March 25 at Lango, northern Uganda.  These were colored like those of the southern race, to be described below, and measured 34.3&ndash;36 mm. &times; 26.3&ndash;26.9.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;From Cape Province north to the coast of the Portuguese Congo, the Katanga, Ankole, and Nairobi and Mombasa in Kenya Colony.  To be expected near the Congo mouth, but not reported from the Kasai district.</p>
				<p>Grant and Mackworth-Praed<note n="3">1936, B. B. O. C., LVI, pp. 103, 104.</note> have recently denied the validity of this southern race, asserting that southern birds are not consistently darker than northern.  We have not sufficient material of the northern race for a satisfactory comparison.</p>
				<p>East of Lake Tanganyika B&ouml;hm found the bronze-winged courser in open plains dotted with <taxonName>Borassus</taxonName> palms, as well as in a wood where the grass had recently been burned.  After being forced to flight they would soon drop to the ground again to seek safety in running.  Dr. J. Bequaert examined a specimen killed at Bukama on May 16, 1911.  Near Elisabethville, writes De Riemaecker, they run at night on paths and sandy roads, and are abundant in April and May.  Winterbottom reports that they visit Northern Rhodesia from mid-June to late August. In Southern Rhodesia<note n="4">Krienke, 1931, Ostrich, II, p. 45; Carlisle, 1932, Ool. Rec., XII, pp. 45, 46.</note> they are said to arrive about August, and to breed from September to December.  Some remain near Bulawayo in January and February.  After the breeding season this race appears to migrate southward.  South of Ovambo Land and the Limpopo River it is believed to be only a summer visitor.</p>
				<p>In the Katanga it occurs from April to November, at least, and should be found breeding.  In southern Ankole on August 23, Captain
<pb n="116" id="t000120-p00122c.tif"/> Pitman<note n="1">1932, Ool.

Millar<note n="2">Sclater, 1906, `Birds of S. Afr.,' IV, p. 331.</note> near Beira, Portuguese East Africa (September), by J.S. Carlisle and Captain Priest in Southern Rhodesia (October, November, December), and by Captain Pitman in Northern Rhodesia (September) were usually depressions in the ground with two or three eggs.  These are cream-colored to rich buff, with a pinkish tinge when fresh, profusely blotched with dark brown and black, most heavily on the blunt end, and with underlying spots of lilac and gray.  Dimensions are said to vary from 32.6&ndash;40 mm. &times; 25&ndash;30.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;From Sierra Leone, Lake Chad, and the River Nile below Khartoum, southward to the Kwanza River and the Zambesi River above Tete.  The eastern limits are marked by Gondar, Abyssinia, the islands in Lake Victoria, and the vicinity of Lake Moero.  There are only two valid races, for <taxonName idx_name="Galachrysia nuchalis emini">emini</taxonName> and <taxonName idx_name="Galachrysia nuchalis marchei">marchei</taxonName> have proved not to be separable from <taxonName idx_name="Galachrysia nuchalis nuchalis">nuchalis</taxonName>.  The principal character of <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Galachrysia nuchalis liberi&aelig;">G. n. liberi&aelig;</taxonName> (Schlegel)</taxon>,<note n="1">1881, Notes Leyden Mus., III, p. 58 (Liberia).</note> ranging from western Cameroon to Sierra Leone, is the rufous nape-band, this area being white in <taxonName idx_name="Galachrysia nuchalis nuchalis">nuchalis</taxonName>.</p>
				<p>The type of <taxonName idx_name="Galachrysia nuchalis nuchalis">nuchalis</taxonName> had white borders on the bases of the outer webs of the secondaries, which are present in one male bird in our series, from Faradje.  The type of <taxonName idx_name="Galachrysia nuchalis marchei">marchei</taxonName> was said to have the wing only 125 mm. long but ten skins from the Ogow&eacute; River in the Rothschild Collection have wings 137&ndash;154 mm.  It may be added that three specimens from Luluabourg, Kasai district, have wings 153&ndash;156 mm., and eleven specimens from the Nepoko River, Ituri River, and the upper Uelle drainage, 144&ndash;155, with one exceptionally long, 160 mm.  There is no perceptible difference between the sexes.</p>
				<p>We first saw flocks of white-collared pratincoles on low rocks in the Congo River not more than one day above Stanley Pool.  From there up to Stanley Falls, at low water in July-August, we repeatedly met flocks numbering fully two hundred.  They would crowd together on the tops of rocks in a strikingly upright posture.  At other times they flew actively about, swallow-like, for they caught their insect food entirely in the air.  Dr. Schouteden found them breeding on the rocks in the mouth of the Kasai River in mid-June.</p>
				<p>Though they were not nesting at Stanley Falls in August, their abundance and their egg-laying did seem correlated with the level of the
<pb n="118" id="t000120-p00124c.tif"/> water in the rivers, so that they might be all but absent when it was high.</p>
				<p>At Gamangui on the Nepoko River toward the end of January we found them nesting.  Many rough gray rocks rose from two to five feet above the water, and in a slight depression in the top of one of them were two eggs.  No nesting material was used, and the sitting bird was visible from a neighboring island.  Both sexes incubate, for one was seen to relieve the other.  Considerable anxiety was shown for the eggs.  The only call we heard was a dry &quot;k&ebreve;k-k&ebreve;k-k&ebreve;k-k&ebreve;k&mdash;&quot; uttered by male and female alike.  A half-dozen pairs frequented this section of the river.</p>
				<p>The eggs are greenish white in ground-color, thickly blotched with dark greenish brown.  My measurements of five eggs are 28.7&ndash;31.5 mm. &times; 21.5&ndash;22.4.<note n="1">Nesting habits and eggs of this pratincole from the Muzima Rocks, L. Victoria, were described by Pitman, 1926, Ool. Rec., VI, pp. 11&ndash;23, 3 photos (of eggs on rocks); 1927," idem, VII, pp. 15&ndash;19, 56&ndash;61; 1930, Bateleur, II, pp. 42&ndash;44 (measurements of eggs).</note>
				</p>
				<p>On February 12, also at Gamangui, another set of two eggs was found, as well as a single chick.  When approached, this youngster crouched beneath a projecting rock, where its color rendered it nearly invisible.  Its natal down was brownish gray above, more or less speckled throughout with dusky.  An indistinct blackish line ran down the middle of the crown, widening on the nape, where it was joined by a black line from the hind corner of the eye.  The lores, too, were crossed by a narrow black line.  On the back there was no distinct pattern, and the throat was uniform smoky gray, the belly a little lighter.  Iris dark brownish gray, bill and feet gray.</p>
				<p>The juvenal plumage which follows next is still radically different from the adult, for there is no trace of the white collar, and aside from the white upper and lower tail-coverts and belly, the young bird is mostly dull gray, speckled all over&mdash;crown, back, wing-coverts, and breast&mdash;with dirty whitish.  Base of bill orange, feet orange-pink. Such birds are seen commonly on the Ituri River in March and April, but soon molt to a plumage approximating the adult.  The type of <taxon><taxonName>Glareola ant&aelig;nia</taxonName> Reichenow</taxon> was presumably an immature bird which had molted its speckled plumage but had not yet assumed the white collar.</p>
				<p>In the eastern Uelle, even along the main rivers, <taxonName>Galachrysia nuchalis</taxonName> is less abundant than farther south.  Some were noted along the Kibali River near Dungu and Nzoro in June and August, one pair incubating an egg as late as June 5.  For a long time none was seen on the Dungu River at Faradje, but one was taken in early May on the Atua River.
<pb n="119" id="t000120-p00125c.tif"/> On the Uelle River above Niangara, in early March, they were rather common about exposed rocks.  On the Ubangi River Dr. Schubotz obtained specimens at Yakoma and Mobaye.</p>
				<p>In descending the Aruwimi River, in September, 1914, we saw a few flocks of these small pratincoles.  There were few places they could alight on sand or rocks, but on one occasion we watched a whole flock perch in the leafy top of a tree projecting above the water, and it was no rare sight to see a few of them perched on dead limbs.</p>
				<p>Traveling down the Congo River from Stanleyville to Leopoldville in December, 1915, during high water, I noted the species only once, near Coquilhatville.  Similarly, at Lukolela during 1930 and 1931, I noted that the white-collared pratincole was absent during the periods when the river was in flood, but present in fair numbers during the month of March, sitting on rocks where available, but also mingling with flocks of <taxonName>Galachrysia cinerea</taxonName> on open sand-bars.  The seasonal movements of some of the common water birds in this equatorial river-system deserve much more investigation.</p>

				<p>SPECIMENS.&mdash;Zambi, &female;, &female; juv., June 22.</p>
				<p>ADULTS.&mdash;Iris dark brown; bill reddish orange on basal half, black distally; feet orange-red on metatarsus, but more brownish on toes, claws blackish.</p>
				<p>This adult female has a well-marked cinnamon patch on the hind-neck, extending round toward the side of the head, but scarcely a trace of buff on the breast.</p>
				<p>The nestling, whose wing is still only 55 mm. long, is very different from its parent, for while the wing-tips are black, the greater coverts whitish and the remaining coverts gray, the crown and back are cinnamon, faintly barred with dusky, the greater tail-coverts white, but the middle rectrices cinnamon spotted with black. The belly is white, but the breast has a band of pale cinnamon.  Ear-coverts pale cinnamon, with no trace of a black band.</p>
				<pb n="120" id="t000120-p00126c.tif"/>
				<p>These are, of course, the colors of the juvenal plumage, and it should be noted how very different is the pattern of this stage in <taxonName idx_name="Galachrysia cinerea">G. cinerea</taxonName> and <taxonName idx_name="Galachrysia nuchalis">G. nuchalis</taxonName>.</p>
				<p>Enough of the natal down still adheres to our specimen to show that on the throat and whole underparts it is white, unmarked, while above its color is a light grayish buff, finely marked, on the back at least, with dusky.  Here again there is a great difference from the natal down of <taxonName idx_name="Galachrysia nuchalis">G. nuchalis</taxonName>.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;From the upper Niger River and the western Gold Coast to the lower Congo River, and eastward along all the larger streams to the Shari, the lower Ubangi, and the Kasai rivers.</p>
				<p>Birds from the upper Niger, above Mopti, are stated to be more rufous on nape and breast, and separated as <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Galachrysia cinerea colorata">G. c. colorata</taxonName> Bates</taxon>.<note n="1">1932, B. B. O. C., LIII, p. 11 (Niger R. between Segu and Kulikoro).</note>  The rest of the range is occupied by <taxonName idx_name="Galachrysia cinerea cinerea">G. c. cinerea</taxonName>.</p>
				<p>Along the Congo River, up to Basoko at least, the gray pratincole is seen commonly during low water, in July and August, and from February to early April.  When the water was high I did not notice any. Flying about over the river to feed, or alighting on sand-bars, they often gather in considerable flocks, sometimes two or three hundred together. The call-note, a hoarse &quot;kree-kree-kree&mdash;&quot; is often reiterated as they run on the sand.</p>
				<p>Near Zambi on the lower Congo, Lang found them nesting in June on the same small sandy islands as the skimmers, but farther back from the shore.  There he found the chick squatting in a slight depression in the sand.</p>
				<p>Near Lukolela I doubted if they were nesting in February and March, because they were continually in flocks, and adult specimens collected were in non-breeding condition.  On August 9, however, I found three pairs on a sandy islet.  One of the birds ran along with both wings extended, and then settled down in an old hippo footprint, scratching sand up behind its tail.  Next it walked to another spot and settled down again.  There I found a circular depression with one egg, while the female again ran about extending her wings.  Dissection showed that she would probably not have laid a second egg.  In West Africa sets of two and of one egg have been found.<note n="2">Reichenow, 1900, `V&ouml;g. Afr.,' I, p. 149.</note>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;From southern Europe eastward to Turkestan and northwestern India, and southward through the more open plains regions of Africa to the Cape Province.  <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Glareola pratincola pratincola">G. p. pratincola</taxonName> (Linn&aelig;us)</taxon><note n="1">1766, `Syst. Nat.,' 12th Ed., I, p. 345 (Austria).</note> of the Mediterranean region and western Asia migrates south only to the Cape Verde Islands and the White Nile.</p>
				<p>Of the four slightly differentiated races in tropical Africa, <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Glareola pratincola erlangeri">G. p. erlangeri</taxonName> Neumann</taxon> is the darkest and smallest, with wings 171&ndash;183 mm. It inhabits the coast of southern Somaliland.  <taxonName idx_name="Glareola pratincola f&uuml;lleborni">G. p. f&uuml;lleborni</taxonName> is slightly larger, wings 173&ndash;193 mm., and not quite so dark.  It ranges from the Cape Province and Natal to Kenya Colony, Lake Albert, the Lomami River, and the Kwanza River in Angola.  <taxonName idx_name="Glareola pratincola boweni">G. p. boweni</taxonName> of the western Sudan and perhaps the Gaboon, a shade lighter than <taxonName idx_name="Glareola pratincola f&uuml;lleborni">f&uuml;lleborni</taxonName>, has wings 179&ndash;196 mm.  Finally, <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Glareola pratincola limbata">G. p. limbata</taxonName> R&uuml;ppell</taxon> of Northeast Africa and southern Arabia, with wings 181&ndash;200 mm., is so closely similar to <taxonName idx_name="Glareola pratincola pratincola">G. p. pratincola</taxonName> as to be scarcely distinguishable.</p>
				<p><taxonName idx_name="Glareola pratincola f&uuml;lleborni">Glareola p. f&uuml;lleborni</taxonName> inhabits the eastern and southeastern Congo, mainly the dry lake-shores, open plains, and sand-bars in rivers.  It also drops into clearings in the forest, but only rarely.</p>
				<p>The Congo Museum has four specimens from the Katanga and Lomami districts.  Three are adults in full plumage, from Lake Musolo, August 29 (de Baillet-Latour), from the upper Luapula R., October 29 (de Witte), and from Mutombo-Mukulu, Lomami, without date (Dr. Bouvier).  The fourth is an immature example from Kando, near
<pb n="122" id="t000120-p00128c.tif"/> Tenke, in early April (de Witte).  Bowen (1931) reported seeing pratin-coles toward September 1 on the sand-bars in the Lualaba River, and from the date they must have been <taxonName idx_name="Glareola pratincola f&uuml;lleborni">f&uuml;lleborni</taxonName>.</p>
				<p>A number of specimens have been secured in the region of Lake Edward, in April, June, July, and December.  In this region the prenuptial molt begins in April.  Other examples were obtained by Grauer in Urundi and on the western shore of Lake Albert.</p>
				<p>A single bird in the Congo Museum, collected by Dr. Christy at Medje, in the Ituri forest, April 27, appears to be adult and is changing to nuptial plumage.  Another from Buta, received from Brother Hutsebaut, is immature, but likewise beginning to molt.  These may be regarded as &quot;strays&quot; from the east or south of the forest.</p>
				<p>In flight and general behavior F&uuml;lleborn&apos;s pratincole resembles <taxonName idx_name="Glareola nordmanni">G. nordmanni</taxonName>, but it is much less common in Congo territory.  It often resorts to sand-banks in rivers, forming small flocks.  In northern Kenya Colony Dr. van Someren<note n="1">1934, Journ. E. Afr. Ug. N. H. Soc., No. 49&ndash;50, pp. 175, 176.</note> found them breeding on the plains around Koroli in June.  Small colonies of birds had sets of two to three eggs, in shallow scrapings in the sand.  The eggs were pale stone-gray with spots, lines, and blotches of dark brown and black.</p>
				<p>In Northern Rhodesia Captain Pitman<note n="2">1934, Rep. Faunal Survey N. Rhodesia, p. 204.</note> observed nesting during September and October on the Kafue Flats; and near Durban, Natal, exceptional colonies of &quot;hundreds&quot; of birds were discovered by Millar<note n="3">1908, Ibis, pp. 385, 386.  Also Chubb, 1914, Ann. Durban Mus., I. p. 42.</note> on ploughed land, in November of 1907 and 1908.  The old birds fluttered on the ground or feigned lameness.  According to Chubb the ground-color of the eggs varies from pale cream to rich buff, their form is ovate, and dimensions 29.2&ndash;33.5 mm. &times; 22.9&ndash;24.4.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;Senegal to Lake Chad, possibly also in the grasslands of the Gaboon, Lower Congo, and northern Angola.  This race is so closely similar to <taxonName idx_name="Glareola pratincola limbata">limbata</taxonName> that many specimens must be indistinguishable, others resemble <taxonName idx_name="Glareola pratincola f&uuml;lleborni">f&uuml;lleborni</taxonName>, and wear of the plumage increases the difficulties.</p>
				<p>In the Congo Museum there is an old abraded adult from Mateba Island in the lower Congo, almost without buff on throat or breast.
<pb n="123" id="t000120-p00129c.tif"/> Another from Stanley Pool in July (Van Delft) is very richly colored, with an unusual amount of buff.  I am inclined to refer these two skins, with wings 191.5 and 185 mm., to <taxonName idx_name="Glareola pratincola boweni">boweni</taxonName>.</p>
				<p>In Angola Bowen collected a female on the Kwanza R. which was dark even for <taxonName idx_name="Glareola pratincola f&uuml;lleborni">f&uuml;lleborni</taxonName>, while the Rothschild Collection contains a male from the same river light enough to have been" identified by Hartert<note n="1">1920, `V&ouml;g. pal.

				<p>SPECIMENS.&mdash;Lubila R., &female; im., Sept. 20.  Panga, &female;, &female; im., Sept. 18.  Avakubi, &female;, Nov. 18.  Bafwabaka, &female;, Apr. 14.  Faradje, 4 &male;, 4 &female;, Apr. 3; &male; im., Sept. 22.</p>
				<p>ADULTS.&mdash;Iris dark brown; bill blackish, corners of mouth orange; feet dusky brown.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;Southeastern Europe and western Asia, from the Dobrudja to Tomsk in Siberia, migrating southward through western and central Africa as far as the Cape Province.  There are very few records from the region of the Great Lakes; and this is one case where the Congo forests in no way bar the route of a typical plains bird&mdash; evidently because of its powers of flight.  The earliest date of arrival at Avakubi was September 5, 1913.  Beginning in September, every year, pratincoles of this species drop in for a rest, by ones or twos, in the larger clearings, in or about villages between Stanleyville and the Ituri. At this season none of the birds show a clearly defined black line encircling the throat, yet some of them are plainly adult.  This autumn plumage of the adult is comparable to that of <taxonName idx_name="Glareola pratincola">G. pratincola</taxonName>, and differs from the breeding plumage in being duller, more worn throughout, lacking the warm buffy coloration of throat and breast, and even the black line running down from the eye.  The sides of the head and throat are streaked with dark grayish, the feathers of the forehead and crown dull brown with pale, narrow edgings.</p>
				<p>Birds of the year are rather similar, but the fork of the tail is not so
<pb n="124" id="t000120-p00130c.tif"/> deep, and the under wing-coverts and axillaries often tipped with reddish brown.  The young bird from the Lubila River was still in juvenal dress, very much spotted and edged with dull buff.</p>
				<p>During the middle of the northern winter none of these pratincoles are seen in the Ituri and Uelle; they reappear around the first of April, presumably going north.  The vast majority must pass over the whole forest belt at a great height, without pausing.</p>
				<p>An observation made at Faradje lends support to this theory.  Late in the afternoon of April 3, 1911, a large compact flock of birds was seen passing overhead at such a height that they were mere unidentifiable specks.  They disappeared, then turned and were seen coming back. Shortly they began to come down.  The closely massed body of birds changed to a long wavering column, descending obliquely.  Five hundred I believed to be a conservative estimate of their number.  When close to the ground they flew to and fro as though examining it, and thus broke up into two or three divisions with the evident object of seeking sleeping quarters.</p>
				<p>Night was now fast approaching.  Flocks passed us several times, but besides the swish of many wings an occasional &quot;k&ibreve;p &mdash; &ibreve;p&quot; was the only sound they made.  They were flying so closely massed that one shot from my gun brought down ten birds.  Darkness quickly hid the rest, and I could only suppose that they finally settled down on some cultivated ground.</p>
				<p>The crops and stomachs of these individuals were all distended with winged termites.  Their flight in pursuit of insects, though exceptionally swift and graceful, is still distinctly limicoline.</p>
				<p>The following year, near Faradje, on April 4, another flock not quite so large was seen high in the air, and on September 22 a solitary bird was taken there.</p>
				<p>In South Africa <taxonName>Glareola nordmanni</taxonName> is famed as a hunter of locusts, and it must not be thought that in the Congo its food consists solely of the winged termites mentioned above.  The stomachs of five other individuals were examined by us: three contained only beetles; another ants; and the last some termites, a small beetle, a grasshopper, and a cockroach.</p>

				<p>There is little doubt that Richardson&apos;s skua&mdash;the parasitic jaeger of American lists&mdash;will be found off the mouth of the Congo.  It breeds in the arctic and subarctic regions of both hemispheres, and migrates southward to Peru, Rio de Janeiro, and the Cape of Good Hope.  Not uncommon along the West African coast, it has been taken in the Gaboon and at Mossamedes.  As early as September 2, in 1927, I noted a party of ten or twelve some two hundred miles off the western coast of Liberia.</p>

				<p>On the return voyage from the Congo, between Sierra Leone and Dakar at the end of February, 1915, I noticed a number of these skuas; sometimes as many as six or eight would be following our ship.</p>
				<p>More surprising is it that during the outward voyage, on June 12, 1909, we saw three of these same skuas a few hours after sailing from Dakar.  Again on July 3, 1930, I watched four of them over the ship&apos;s wake off the coast of Senegal; and on May 1 and 2, 1931, four or five were noted off Portuguese Guinea and near Cape Verde.

				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;Breeding in the Azores, the Canary Islands, northern Europe, and northwestern Asia to the Taimyr Peninsula. Dwight (1925) recognized four races, but <taxonName idx_name="Larus fuscus atlantis">atlantis</taxonName> is often regarded by others as a subspecies of <taxonName idx_name="Larus argentatus">L. argentatus</taxonName>.  Stegmann<note n="1">1934, J. f. O., pp. 340&ndash;380.</note> would make the species far more comprehensive, including even <taxonName idx_name="Larus argentatus">argentatus</taxonName> and <taxonName idx_name="Larus californicus">californicus</taxonName>.</p>
				<p><taxonName idx_name="Larus fuscus fuscus">L. f. fuscus</taxonName>, with the most blackish mantle of all, nests from Scandinavia eastward to the Dwina River, and migrates southward to the Red Sea, Lake Naivasha, Lake Tanganyika, Lake Nyasa, the Kasai district, and Sierra Leone.  Some individuals, even adults, spend the northern summer on Lake Victoria and other bodies of water in tropical Africa, but I cannot believe that they ever breed there.</p>
				<p>This is the only gull we ever saw on the rivers of the northern Congo, and not a common bird there, no adults being noticed.  Our three specimens, all birds of the first winter, were" identified by Doctor J. Dwight. These young examples were emaciated, as though from starvation, and a single fish scale was all that we could find in their stomachs.  One of them weighed only 377 grams.  Another young gull, presumably of this species, was noticed several times at Stanleyville from November 20 to 28, 1914; and on July 20, 1930 a sub-adult in abraded plumage was observed at Kinshasa on Stanley Pool.  Sch&uuml;z (1934, 1935) reported a bird taken between Ngombe and Coquilhatville which had been banded
<pb n="128" id="t000120-p00134c.tif"/> as a transient at Rossitten, Germany, and another from Lukolela which had been similarly marked on the west coast of Finland.</p>
				<p>On Lake Edward I saw a black-backed gull in adult plumage at Katwe on January 21, 1927, while Sage noted another at Kasindi Landing about the same date.  Two more were seen together at Kabare on the south shore of the same lake on May 12, 1927, so it seems that a few may remain there through the northern summer.  An example in adult plumage was collected in June, 1937, by C. R. Stegall on Lake Munkamba in the Kasai.</p>
				<p><taxon><taxonName>Larus fuscus graellsii</taxonName> A. E. Brehm</taxon>, with the mantle of adults not quite so black, breeds from the Faeroes to the western coast of France, and migrates southward occasionally to the Niger delta.  It is not likely to reach the Congo.</p>

				<p>The Atlantic Islands gull breeds on the Azores and the Canary Islands. While many remain in the Azores in mid-winter, as I can state from personal observation, others wander southward to the Cape Verde Islands and the Gambia.  The mantle in this form is nearly as pale gray as in a herring gull, so for many years it was confused with <taxon><taxonName>Larus cachinnans</taxonName> Pallas</taxon>, which breeds from the Adriatic Sea to Lake Baikal, and is usually regarded as a race of <taxonName idx_name="Larus argentatus">L. argentatus</taxonName>.</p>
				<p>It now seems certain that <taxonName idx_name="Larus cachinnans">cachinnans</taxonName> reaches Africa only on the shores of the Mediterranean and Red Sea, and it is very doubtful whether <taxonName idx_name="Larus fuscus atlantis">atlantis</taxonName> ever travels south to Angola.

				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;In South America from Argentina to southeast Brazil and Peru; in Africa from the Gambia, Lake Chad, and southern Abyssinia to Walfish Bay and Natal, not only on the coasts, but on the larger inland lakes; also on lakes in Madagascar.  Doctor Dwight believed that the African birds were darker and smaller, with decidedly smaller white spots near the tips of the primaries, than those of South America.  While there may be a slight average difference in these respects, it seems scarcely sufficient for subspecific differentiation.<note n="1">Names applicable to the African representative are <taxon><taxonName>Larus poiocephalus</taxonName> Swainson, 1837, `Birds W.

				<p>Within our limits the gray-headed gull is largely restricted to the great lakes of the eastern border, where it is rather common, save on Lake Albert.  On Lake Edward it has been found in January, May, June, July, and November, so there is a possibility that it nests there. I have seen it in April on Lake Bunyoni, and in July on Lake Kivu. Along the eastern shore of Lake Tanganyika Claude Grant observed it throughout the year, yet failed to find a breeding locality.  Neave collected an adult male on Lake Bangweolo in July.  This gull has long been known to breed on a rocky islet near the western shore of Lake Victoria.<note n="2">Neumann, 1898, J. f. O., p. 248.</note> It laid its eggs during June in sets of two or three, and occasionally as many as five, on rocks overgrown with ferns.  Only seldom was a nest built of dry grass.  The eggs were described as whitish gray, pale greenish, or buff, with large violet-gray shell-markings and sepia-brown spots.  Dimensions, 49.5&ndash;56.5 mm. &times; 34.5&ndash;38.5.  Captain Pitman<note n="3">1934, Ibis, p. 209.</note> reports that the breeding season begins there in April, and sometimes continues till September.</p>
				<p>Nests found by Doctor Mearns on the swampy shore of Lake Naivasha
<pb n="130" id="t000120-p00136c.tif"/> were built of pieces of aquatic plants and grasses, mixed with mud, so that they resembled those of coots.  Other localities where the species nests are Lake Stefanie, Lake Rudolf, and Zululand.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.  &mdash;Wide-ranging through the tropical seas, the typical race occupying the coasts and islands of the Atlantic, from the Gulf of Mexico and the West Indies to the Tristan group, St. Helena, Ascension, and the west coast of Africa between the Gold Coast and the Cameroon.  Four other races range from the Red Sea across the Indian and Pacific Oceans.</p>
				<p>That the noddy brought back from Tuckey&apos;s expedition really came from the Lower Congo cannot be considered proved.  No one has recently found the species there, nor on the adjacent coast.  But I have seen a skin from Batanga, Cameroon, obtained by J.A. Reis for the Carnegie Museum; and others have been procured on S&atilde;o Tom&eacute; and Rollas Island.  So the noddy may occasionally wander to the Congo mouth.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.  &mdash;Breeding in North America, Europe, and western Asia, at least to the Obi River; migrating south to Chile Angola, Lake Victoria, and perhaps Tanganyika Territory.  The American race is <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Chlidonias nigra surinamensis">C. n. surinamensis</taxonName> (Gmelin)</taxon>.  The typical form is a common winter visitant in Upper Guinea, but rare in the eastern half of the continent. The black tern, it seems, seldom crosses the equator.</p>
				<p>The specimen from Banana may well have been <taxonName idx_name="Chlidonias nigra">nigra</taxonName>, but I shared the doubts expressed by Professor Reichenow as to the" identification of birds from Lake Albert and the Kivu Volcanoes.  It seemed far more probable that they were <taxonName idx_name="Chlidonias leucoptera">leucoptera</taxonName>.  Mr. Bannerman has kindly examined the Kivu specimen in the British Museum and pronounces it <taxonName idx_name="Chlidonias leucoptera">leucoptera</taxonName>.  On the other hand, Colonel Meinertzbagen did collect <taxonName idx_name="Chlidonias nigra">nigra</taxonName> in breeding plumage at Kisumu on Lake Victoria, April 30, 1916, so possibly it does occur on Lake Albert.</p>

				<p>SPECIMENS.  &mdash;Avakubi, 2 &male;, Dec. 2, 5; &female;, Nov. 16.  Faradje, &female;, Oct. 27.</p>
				<p>All four specimens are in winter or immature plumage.  The female from Faradje has the rump pure white, but the tail gray; the other specimens all have the rump pearl-gray.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION.  &mdash;Middle and southern Europe, east to China, migrating to New Zealand, Australia, and South Africa.  Every year, in October or November, these terns appear along the rivers of the northeastern Congo, flying up and down, either over the water or over the clearings nearby.  There are seldom more than three together, and they are rarely seen to alight.  Probably the insects, sometimes as large as grasshoppers, which we found in their stomachs, are taken on the wing.</p>
				<p>In 1912 we first noted the species at Faradje on October 27; in 1913 they were rather common at Avakubi by November 16.  Only a single bird in the breeding plumage was seen in the Uelle district, at Faradje, May 1, 1912.</p>
				<p>At the south end of Lake Edward, on May 10, 1927, the white-winged black tern was still common, both in the marshes and out on the lake. One flock of forty to fifty was noticed, but the birds in pale &quot;immature&quot; plumage outnumbered those with blackish head and breast by fifteen to one.  Two of the latter were shot, and were found to be females with very slight enlargement of the ovary.  They had not quite completed the prenuptial molt.</p>
				<p>As this marsh tern has been reported from Lake Edward in June, and Lake Albert in August, it is evident that some remain in Central Africa during the northern summer.  At Jinja on Lake Victoria, I myself noticed one in adult black-headed dress and five in white-headed plumage on August 1.  There is no reason to suspect that they breed anywhere in tropical Africa, and Jackson&apos;s notes on nesting at Lake Naivasha, quoted by Bannerman,<note n="1">1931, `Birds Trop. W. Afr.,' II, pp. 273, 274.</note> undoubtedly refer to <taxonName idx_name="Chlidonias hybrida sclateri">C. hybrida sclateri</taxonName>.</p>
				<p>At Lukolela on the middle Congo I failed to notice any white-winged black terns during the autumnal migration of 1930, but from the middle of February to the end of March they became increasingly numerous. Flocks of thirty to one hundred and fifty wandered over the river and alighted on bars.  Lower down the river, near Kunzulu, they were even more abundant on April 8.  So the species is by no means confined to the eastern half of the Congo, though it is said to be rare west of the Cameroon.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.  &mdash;From Europe, Turkestan, and China to Australia, Ceylon, South Africa, and Madagascar.  The typical race breeds from Spain and North Africa to Russia and Turkestan, migrating southward to the Gambia, upper Niger River, the Congo, and White Nile.  <taxonName idx_name="Chlidonias hybrida sclateri">C. h. sclateri</taxonName> of southern and eastern Africa, and of Madagascar, is darker gray above and below.  Three other races of the whiskered tern occupy India, southern China, New Guinea, and Australia.</p>
				<p>The example reported from Kabare (November 14) is preserved in the Congo Museum, and to me it seems certainly <taxonName idx_name="Chlidonias hybrida hybrida">C. h. hybrida</taxonName>.  It is doubtful, however, whether the typical form migrates to Kenya Colony, where <taxonName idx_name="Chlidonias hybrida sclateri">sclateri</taxonName> breeds in June and July on Lake Naivasha.  Along the middle Congo near Lukolela, on March 22, 1931, I watched an adult <taxonName idx_name="Chlidonias hybrida hybrida">C. h. hybrida</taxonName> in breeding dress as it flew by, and a week later another&mdash;if it was not the same individual&mdash;standing on the sand with a flock of more than a hundred <taxonName idx_name="Chlidonias leucoptera">C. leucoptera</taxonName>.  It is proved, therefore, that a few of the northern whiskered terns do reach the Congo River.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION.  &mdash;The South African race of the whiskered tern extends north from Cape Province to Kenya Colony, the Lualaba River, and Angola, besides being found in Madagascar.</p>
				<p>At Lake Naivasha in Kenya Colony, July 11, 1926, we collected one adult male in breeding plumage, and saw three or four others in similar dress.  Both the season and the dark gray color of the back indicate that our bird belongs to the African race, which seems therefore to breed at Lake Naivasha.  I have no doubt that this was really the tern found nesting there by Sir Frederick Jackson in June and July.<note n="1">Bannerman, 1931, `Birds Trop. W. Afr.,' II, p. 273.</note> It built nests of dry grass on lily leaves, floating reeds, or old grebe nests, and laid two or three eggs, cream-colored to buff, sometimes tinged with green, spotted and blotched with reddish or blackish brown and dark gray, with underlying mauve markings.  Dimensions, 37&ndash;40.5 mm. &times; 29&ndash;29.5.</p>
				<pb n="134" id="t000120-p00140c.tif"/>
				<p>Loveridge has noted that <taxonName idx_name="Chlidonias hybrida sclateri">C. h. sclateri</taxonName> was apparently nesting in the marshes at Nzingi, Tanganyika Territory, late in May; and Paget-Wilkes and Belcher have both found it breeding at Lake Chilwa, Nyasaland, in September.  Belcher believed that it migrated northward in November, while Roberts has seen it in the Union of South Africa only during the summer months.</p>
				<p>Whether this tern breeds in the southeastern Congo is doubtful; but at the outlet of Lake Kisale, on August 9, 1927, I secured a non-breeding male in off-season plumage, and saw a half dozen others flying up and down over the river.  These may have been migrants from farther south.  On the upper Kafue River, Paget-Wilkes reported <taxonName idx_name="Chlidonias hybrida hybrida">hybrida</taxonName> as arriving at the beginning of January, mostly in immature plumage.  It seems scarcely possible that the European race migrates so far south, and I am not sure that his" identification was correct.</p>

				<p>The Damara tern ranges from Table Bay along the coasts of southwestern Africa as far as Massabe near Landana, and thus undoubtedly occurs at the mouth of the Congo.  Arriving at Banana on June 21, 1909, I noted a number of terns of two sizes, and have no doubt that the smaller ones were <taxonName idx_name="Sterna bal&aelig;narum">S. bal&aelig;narum</taxonName>.

				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.  &mdash;The royal tern is found along the American coasts from Virginia and Lower California southward, reaching Argentina and Peru, at least in the northern winter.  It is also represented on the western coasts of Africa, from Gibraltar to Benguella, by the present subspecies, which is distinguished by paler gray upper-parts,
<pb n="138" id="t000120-p00144c.tif"/> especially the wing-coverts, and by a deeper bill.  The wing and tail of <taxonName idx_name="Sterna maxima albididorsalis">albididorsalis</taxonName> are often somewhat longer than those of the American <taxonName idx_name="Sterna maxima">maxima</taxonName>.</p>
				<p>The known range of this race, of which specimens had been taken at Landana and Loanda, made its occurrence near Banana certain.  In late July, 1920, Dr. Schouteden collected one immature example there, and noted the species as common.  <taxon><taxonName>Sterna bergii</taxonName> Lichtenstein</taxon> is an allied species of South Africa and the Indian Ocean, and the specimen reported by Dubois as from the Mayombe was also <taxonName idx_name="Sterna maxima albididorsalis">albididorsalis</taxonName>.  It is still in the Congo Museum.</p>
				<p>Going northward along the Gaboon coast in February, 1915, I often saw these large terns sitting on buoys or logs in the harbors, but never in numbers.  They were then in non-breeding or immature plumage. While some are present on the Cameroon and Congo coasts even during the northern summer, their nesting places remain to be discovered.</p>

				<p>SPECIMENS.  &mdash;Zambi, &male;, June 28; &female;, June 22, 2 &male; juv., June 25; 3 &female; juv., June 24.  Lukolela, 1 without sex or date.</p>
				<p>ADULTS.  &mdash;Despite the specific name, the bill is largely scarlet, changing to yellow on the distal third, so that the tips of both maxilla and mandible are yellow. Iris dark brown; feet red, claws blackish.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION.  &mdash;Tropical Africa from Senegal and Upper Egypt south to the Orange River.  In the Congo, skimmers are found only along the larger rivers and lakes, and were never seen by us along the Uelle River above Niangara, or the Ituri-Aruwimi down as far as Banalia. One specimen taken at Poko on the Bomokandi River was shown
<pb n="140" id="t000120-p00146c.tif"/> me by a Belgian officer; in the Congo Museum there is another from Buta.</p>
				<p>We first observed the species in fair numbers during our voyage up the Congo between Stanley Pool and Lisala in July, 1909, during a period of low water.  The largest flock, numbering forty birds, was seen near Lisala; another of thirty, on a sand-bar near Irebu.</p>
				<p>On my way down the Congo from Stanleyville to Leopoldville in December, 1914, when the water was extremely high, no skimmers were noticed at all.  Again in 1930-31, near Lukolela, skimmers were common at both seasons of low water, yet wholly wanting at high water from September to December.  I believe that like many other water-birds they will be found to perform short migrations, dependent upon the change of level in rivers, low water being much more favorable for their fishing and nesting.</p>
				<p>During the middle of the day they are seen resting on bars and sandy beaches among the islands, but toward sundown they become much more active.  Only then and shortly after sundown did I see them plowing the surface of the river with their blade-like mandibles.  The head is held rather low, the wings beating slowly, always above the horizontal plane.<note n="1">See Young, 1928, Ibis, p. 767, Fig. 18, for a diagram showing <taxonName idx_name="Rhyncops cinerascens">R. cinerascens</taxonName> thus engaged.  A theory as to the function of the oblique ridges on the mandible is offered by Schildmacher, 1931, O. Mb., pp. 37&ndash;41.</note> When not plowing, the bird flies more like a large tern, and the downward sweep of the wing-tips carries them well below the bird&apos;s body. One evening at 6:50 I watched a skimmer cutting the water with its bill and the wake showed as a white line by the moonlight.  The call is usually a high-pitched &quot;kip!&quot; or &quot;peep!&quot; repeated several times, and occasionally prolonged with a tern-like trill.  Perhaps because of the resemblance of the notes to those of <taxonName>Xiphidiopterus</taxonName>, as well as a certain similarity in color, the Mobangi tribe near Lukolela use the same word, &quot;Ndawle,&quot; as the name of both skimmer and lapwing.</p>
				<p>I suppose that these skimmers nest along the middle Congo above Stanley Pool toward July, and they certainly do so in March.  Near Lukolela we found a number of nests on a sand-bar on March 22, 1931, with sets of two and of three eggs.  These were laid in round depressions scooped in the sand, and about them were radiating grooves where the incubating birds had rested their long beaks.  Those not occupied with incubation were apt to sit in groups and to take wing in a body.  When disturbed, all the members of a colony will fly about in a compact flock perhaps of twenty-five to thirty or more, displaying perfect co&ouml;rdination.
<pb n="141" id="t000120-p00147c.tif"/> Once I watched two skimmers hotly pursuing a peregrine falcon, darting at it from above!</p>
				<p>The eggs are pale buff, freely spotted with warm dark brown.  Some of the spots are clouded over and more grayish.  Dimensions of five eggs (two sets) from the vicinity of Lukolela, 37&ndash;41.5 mm. &times; 28&ndash;29.2.</p>
				<p>On the lower Congo, near Zambi, in June, 1915, Lang found the skimmers breeding on four or five small islands.  Each colony consisted of about five pairs, each with two eggs or young.  By June 25, many young were rapidly developing their juvenal plumage.  Breeding stations of <taxonName>Rynchops flavirostris</taxonName> are scattered widely over the African continent, from the Senegal River, the Niger, and Dongola south at least to the Zambesi.  In Sudanese latitudes and on Lake Rudolf it nests in April and May; in Tanganyika Territory toward September; and along the Zambesi and Kafue Rivers in September and October, but also in June.</p>
				<p>On Lake Edward skimmers have been collected in June and November. At the mouths of the Rutshuru and Ruindi rivers, in April, Count Gyldenstolpe and L&eacute;on Lippens both saw hundreds frequenting the sand-banks, though they were not nesting there.  When I visited the same locality in May, 1927, the water of the lake was high, covering these banks, and not one skimmer was noticed during a stay of four days. Along the upper Lualaba, in 1926, we watched skimmers from the steamer during the period of low water.  Near Kadia, August 9, there were three; and above Kiabo, the following day, first two and then a flock of twenty-five.  Flying buoyantly with very slow wing-beats, they would sometimes utter an excited gull-like call: &quot;kek-kek-kek&mdash;.&quot;</p>
				<p>There can be no doubt that skimmers capture fish.  In the stomach of an adult <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Rhyncops flavirostris">R. flavirostris</taxonName> Lang</taxon> found a fish 8 cm. long.  I too have watched the American <taxonName idx_name="Rhyncops nigra">R. nigra</taxonName> come to its nest with thin eel-like fish in its beak.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;Eastern Africa from Eritrea to the Orange River.  Of the three subspecies recognized, <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Pterocles gutturalis gutturalis">P. g. gutturalis</taxonName> (Smith)</taxon> ranges from western Transvaal and Bechuanaland north to Nyasaland and the Kafue River.  <taxonName idx_name="Pterocles gutturalis tanganjic&aelig;">P. g. tanganjic&aelig;</taxonName> occupies southwestern Tanganyika Territory, and apparently extends to the district about Lake Moero, though not yet reported from the Katanga proper. Storms' specimen from Tanganyika may have been taken on the eastern side of the lake, though the majority of his birds came from the vicinity of Mpala.  The status of this sand-grouse as a Congo bird is therefore somewhat uncertain.  <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Pterocles gutturalis saturatior">P. g. saturatior</taxonName> (Hartert)</taxon> continues the range of the species through the drier parts of East Africa to Abyssinia and Eritrea.</p>

				<p>The chestnut-bellied sand-grouse, as a species, ranges from Senegal across the Sudan to Egypt and Abyssinia, and south in East Africa to
<pb n="143" id="t000120-p00149c.tif"/> the Kilimanjaro district; also through Somaliland and Arabia to India. Five races are listed in Sclater&apos;s `Systema,' but there is little likelihood of the typical Sudanese race occurring along the northern border of the Congo.  <taxonName idx_name="Pterocles exustus emini">P. e. emini</taxonName> was described from a single female taken by Emin and Stuhlmann in &quot;the region northwest of Lake Victoria,&quot; supposed to differ from the typical form in the paler, sandier ground-color of its upperparts and narrower rufous bars on the abdomen.  The status of the race is extremely uncertain.</p>
				<p>Little is known of the occurrence of the species near the type locality of <taxonName idx_name="Pterocles exustus emini">emini</taxonName>, perhaps it will be found in the dry areas of Ankole or near Lake George, not far from the Congo border.  But Sir Frederick Jackson did not mention any sand-grouse as occurring in that part of Uganda.</p>

				<p>The double-banded sand-grouse ranges from Little Namaqualand and the Transvaal north to Benguella and to the Loangwa Valley in northeastern Rhodesia.  The typical race occupies the western portion of the range, north to Benguella; and <taxonName idx_name="Pterocles bicinctus multicolor">N. b. multicolor</taxonName> the countries from the Transvaal to the Loangwa Valley.  It is doubtful whether the species reaches any part of the Katanga district; Neave regarded it as confined to the Loangwa Valley, where it was not uncommon, in pairs, in &quot;Mopani&quot; flats and sandy areas near the larger rivers.</p>

				<p>The four-banded sand-grouse, divisible in two races, extends from Senegal to the region of Lake Chad, the Upper Nile Valley, and the northern part of Uganda.  Its eastern form, lowei, has been found in the Shari River region, at Raffali rapids in the Bahr-el-Ghazal province, and at Lado on the Bahr-el-Jebel; but it can only occur accidentally, if at all, along the northern Congo border.  There are no records thus far.</p>

				<p>SPECIMEN.&mdash;Faradje, &male;, Mar. 13.</p>
				<p>ADULT MALE.&mdash;Iris dark brown, eyelids grayish; basal half of bill dark red, outer half orange; feet purplish red.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;From Senegal, Asben, Berber Province, and southern Arabia, south to the Cape Province; also on Socotra and Madagascar.  Unknown, however, in the heavy forests of western and central Africa.  There are no racial differences among birds from the African mainland, only the Madagascar <taxon><taxonName idx_name="&OElig;na capensis aliena">&OElig;. c. aliena</taxonName> Bangs</taxon> being separable.</p>
				<p>The Namaqua dove is known from several border districts of the Belgian Congo: the Uelle, Tanganyika, and Upper Katanga; and it must occur near the Congo mouth, since it ranges north to the Gaboon. It may also be expected around the shores of Lake Edward, for I have collected one between Kasindi and Katwe.</p>
				<p>In the Katanga it is common, frequenting native gardens, in Marungu apparently less so.  In the Uelle our single example was killed by a native chief, who found it in his village feeding on <taxonName>Eleusine</taxonName> millet. The record from Buta is altogether exceptional.</p>
				<p>The voice is a feeble cooing, so low as almost to pass unnoticed.  It resembles the weak initial notes of <taxonName>Turtur afer</taxonName>, carried no further.<note n="1">Bates, 1934, Ibis, p. 221.</note> The bird keeps very much to low bushes and the ground.</p>
				<p>Reproduction takes place largely during the dry season, and the nest is a frail structure of twigs, fine rootlets, or grass, placed not far above the ground.  The two elliptical eggs are cream-colored, 19&ndash;21.5 mm. &times; 14.5&ndash;15.5.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;Senegal to southern Abyssinia, Angola, Southern Rhodesia, Pemba Island and Zanzibar.  <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Turtur afer afer">T. a. afer</taxonName> (Linn&aelig;us)</taxon> is found from Senegal to Sierra Leone.  The more deeply colored <taxonName idx_name="Turtur afer kilimensis">kilimensis</taxonName> occupies the remainder of the range except the Abyssinian highland, where there is another pale race, <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Turtur afer mearnsi">T. a. mearnsi</taxonName> Sclater and M.-Praed</taxon>.</p>
				<p>In the humid area of western and central Africa <taxonName>Turtur afer</taxonName> is the common species of the genus, though its range overlaps that of <taxonName idx_name="Turtur chalcospilos">T. chalcospilos</taxonName> in eastern Africa, the Katanga, and Angola.  <taxonName idx_name="Turtur afer kilimensis">T. a. kilimensis</taxonName> is found throughout the Belgian Congo, except on the high mountains.  I did not notice it above 5000 feet on Ruwenzori, but in the Kivu district and Marungu it ascends to 6000 feet.</p>
				<p>Clearings are inhabited by it in heavy forest country, while <taxonName>Tympanistria</taxonName> favors the denser second growth.  In the savanna districts Turtur afer frequents the more open brush, <taxonName>Tympanistria</taxonName> the patches of woods. The cooing of the blue-spotted dove is a most familiar sound, the syllables numbering fourteen to sixteen or more.  The first coo is rather loud, the next four very low, the sixth and seventh doubled.  Those following are regularly spaced, dying gradually away.  There may be some variation in these details, but the faint coos followed by doubled ones are characteristic.</p>
				<p>The food, consisting mainly of seeds, is sought on the ground; and these doves are often flushed along roads.  Nesting seems to be carried on mainly during the dry season; and the nests are rather small and flat, placed in bushes or low trees.  One was found at Faradje on January 26, in a bush; another at Lukolela on March 1, on a small tree leaning over the river bank.  The two eggs are decidedly buffy, and measure 22&ndash;25.1 mm &times; 17&ndash;18.3.<note n="1">Pitman, 1930, Ool. Rec., X, p. 17.</note>

				<p>The blue-spotted dove with blackish bill, and plumage much lighter and grayer than <taxonName idx_name="Turtur afer">T. afer</taxonName>, ranges across the drier parts of the Sudan from
<pb n="148" id="t000120-p00154c.tif"/> Senegal to the White Nile, northern Abyssinia, and Eritrea.

				<p>There are no Congo records of <taxonName idx_name="Turtur abyssinicus">abyssinicus</taxonName>, but it has been taken on the Shari River, at Wau in the Bahr-el-Ghazal, and at Gondokoro, so it should be looked for along the northeastern Congo border and especially at the north end of Lake Albert.</p>

				<p>ADULTS.&mdash;Iris dark brown; bill dark purplish, blackish toward tip; feet dark purplish red.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;Cape Province north to the Gaboon coast, Angola, Katanga, Kenya Colony, Somaliland, and Abyssinia.  Of the many races proposed, only the pale <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Turtur chalcospilos volkmanni">T. c. volkmanni</taxonName> (Reichenow)</taxon> of dry Southwest Africa is readily separable from the typical form.  Angolan specimens, however, are slightly lighter in color than a skin from Natal; and if <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Turtur chalcospilos erlangeri">T. c. erlangeri</taxonName> (Reichenow)</taxon><note n="3">1902, J. f. O, p. 134 (Angoia).</note> is valid, this is the form occurring in the southern Congo.</p>
				<p>The green-spotted dove must be found near the coast at the Congo mouth, but no specimen is yet known from the Kasai district.  Near Elisabethville <taxonName idx_name="Turtur chalcospilos">chalcospilos</taxonName> and <taxonName idx_name="Turtur afer">afer</taxonName> both occur; and we have skins of <taxonName idx_name="Turtur chalcospilos">chalcospilos</taxonName> from Kasoko and Lake Suse in Marungu, as well as afer from
<pb n="149" id="t000120-p00155c.tif"/> Moba and Ketendwe.  Both species are found on the north shore of Lake Kivu, but it is very doubtful whether <taxonName idx_name="Turtur chalcospilos">chalcospilos</taxonName> reaches Lake Albert.<note n="1">See, however, Schubotz, 1921, Tageb. Emin Pascha, VI, p 70.</note>
				</p>
				<p>The voice of the green-spotted dove is exceedingly similar to that of <taxonName idx_name="Turtur afer">T. afer</taxonName>, but in Kenya Colony I noted that <taxonName idx_name="Turtur chalcospilos">chalcospilos</taxonName> gave first two soft coos.  After a slight pause came a third and a fourth, nearly double, uttered slowly, as was the fifth.  The sixth to eighth became louder and more confluent, then followed another pause.  The ninth and tenth are almost run together, and the final series of about fifteen coos dies gradually away.</p>
				<p>It seems probable that the dry season is preferred for nesting.  The two eggs are creamy white or ivory-color, 21&ndash;25 mm. &times; 16.5&ndash;19.  The nest is placed in a bush or low tree, often no higher than two yards.</p>

				<p>ADULTS of BOTH SEXES.&mdash;Iris dark brown, eyelids dark purplish gray; bill dark brown, tinged with red toward base; feet dark purplish red, claws dark brown.</p>
				<pb n="150" id="t000120-p00156c.tif"/>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;Nearly all Africa south of the Sahara, from Sierra Leone, Lake Chad, and Abyssinia south to eastern Cape Province.  Apparently it is lacking in the eastern Sudan, and in dry Southwest Africa.  <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Tympanistria tympanistria tympanistria">T. t. tympanistria</taxonName> (Temminck and Knip)</taxon> of South Africa is usually stated to be replaced north of the Zambesi by <taxonName idx_name="Tympanistria tympanistria fraseri">T. t. fraseri</taxonName>.</p>
				<p>The whole of the Belgian Congo is thus included in its range, but in savanna country like that about Faradje the bird is comparatively scarce.  It ascends the forested mountains of the eastern border to about 7000 feet, yet there are no records from the more open highlands of Marungu and Upper Katanga.</p>
				<p>To me the difference between <taxonName idx_name="Tympanistria tympanistria tympanistria">tympanistria</taxonName> and <taxonName idx_name="Tympanistria tympanistria fraseri">fraseri</taxonName> seems very slight.  <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Tympanistria virgo">T. virgo</taxonName> Hartlaub</taxon> was based on a specimen without wing-spots. These are lacking in the barred juvenal plumage, which is so characteristic of <taxonName>&OElig;na</taxonName>, <taxonName>Turtur</taxonName>, <taxonName>Tympanistria</taxonName>, and <taxonName>Calopelia</taxonName>.</p>
				<p>In savanna country the tambourine dove is restricted to patches of forest; in forest country it keeps very much to dense second growth.  In the morning and late afternoon its soft cooing notes are frequently heard. One to which I listened carefully began with four or five short coos, repeated slowly, and followed by a noticeable pause.  Next came three rather rapid ones, another short stop, and then a triple &quot;c - c - coo&quot; which was followed by a declining series of fifteen to twenty short notes, increasing in rapidity almost to a trill.</p>
				<p>Breeding must go on, in the forest area, at all seasons, even in the drier periods.  A nest at Avakubi, August 18, was in a small tree at the edge of the forest, eleven feet up.  Sets are of two eggs, ivory-white to light brownish-cream, 22.7&ndash;25.3 mm. &times; 17.3&ndash;19.4.</p>
				<p>In the crops of three birds I found rice, small fruits, and hard black seeds.  On west Ruwenzori they were eating castor-oil seeds, as Ayres also noted in South Africa.</p>

				<p>ADULTS OF BOTH SEXES.&mdash;Iris dark brown, eyelids very dark gray; basal half of bill dark purplish red, distal half greenish; feet purplish red, claws brownish gray.</p>
				<p>All the adult specimens have the wing-spots of a coppery lustre, except a female from Medje, which shows spots of that color on the left wing, but much greener ones on the right wing.  In one young male the spots are brassy-green.</p>
				<p>Remnants of the juvenal plumage show that it is largely bright rufous, even on crown and cheeks, the body barred with blackish, the remiges with rufous tips, and dusky subterminal bars on secondaries.  There are no metallic wing-spots, and the inner rectrices show blackish markings.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;Forests from Sierra Leone to the Lower congo and the eastern border of the Congo forest.  Never in mountain forests.  <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Calopelia brehmeri infelix">C. b. infelix</taxonName> (Peters)</taxon><note n="1"><taxon><taxonName>Turtur brehmeri infelix</taxonName> PETERS, 1937, `Check-List,' III, p. 113</taxon>, new name for <taxon><taxonName>Columba (Perisera) puella</taxonName> SCHLEGEL, 1848</taxon>, nec. <taxon><taxonName>Columba puella</taxonName> Lesson, 1827</taxon>.</note> has metallic green spots on the wings, and occupies Upper Guinea, extending to the coast of Cameroon. In the interior of Cameroon and in the Gaboon it is replaced by <taxonName idx_name="Calopelia brehmeri brehmeri">C. b. brehmeri</taxonName>, with coppery wing-spots.  Where the races meet there seems to be an indication of intergradation in the color of these spots.<note n="2">See Bates, 1911, Ibis, p. 489; 1930, `Handbook Birds W. Afr.,' p. 19.</note> <taxonName idx_name="Calopelia brehmeri brehmeri">C. b. brehmeri</taxonName> has been found from the coast of the Gaboon and Portuguese Congo, as well as the River Ja in the Cameroon, eastward across the Congo forest to the Bomokandi River and the Semliki Valley.  On the south it has been collected in the Mayombe forest and at Kunungu near Bolobo.  It must reach the Sankuru River, at least, and the forest of the Manyema district.</p>
				<p>A true forest dove, <taxonName>Calopelia brehmeri</taxonName> is never seen in clearings, and is only seldom found in tall second growth.  Even in the Ituri forest it would be considered rare if it were not for its distinctive cooing. This cannot be confused with the voices of <taxonName>Turtur</taxonName> or <taxonName>Tympanistria</taxonName>, for the series of coos is so much louder and more abrupt that they may better be written &quot;coop!&quot;  They have something liquid in their quality, suggesting the reiterated &quot;ploop!&quot; of water being poured from some gigantic carafe.  The opening syllables are slowly uttered and loud, the others gradually die away, and there is little irregularity in their spacing.
<pb n="152" id="t000120-p00158c.tif"/> These calls are always given from a tree; on the ground the birds are silent and difficult to see.</p>
				<p>The nest may be placed relatively near the ground, for one near Avakubi (September 27) was only ten feet up in a small tree.  It was flattish, built of dry twigs and rootlets, containing a single young squab. At Medje (August 30) a brood of two was brought in by natives.  In the northern Ituri forest breeding seems to go on from July to October, at least.  Likewise at Lukolela, the season of reproduction seemed to be the rainy part of the year, and little cooing was heard in the dry period. A female taken there on January 15, was about to lay an egg with rather soft shell, already slightly buff-colored, measuring 27 &times; 19.6 mm.  Bates gave the dimensions of an egg as 27.5 &times; 21 mm.  One which I found at Angumu on July 15, 1937, was olive-buff, 27.9 &times; 21.2 mm.</p>
				<p>While many of these doves were snared on the ground near broken pieces of termite nest, no insects were found in seven examinations of crops and stomachs.  All the birds had swallowed seeds of varying size, some quite hard.  Two had also eaten slugs, three in all; and small stones or sand were found in two gizzards.</p>

				<p>During my first stay in the Congo I saw this dove only in the northeastern corner of the colony, from Niangara to the Sudan border.  Beyond Dungu they were common and, unlike <taxonName>Streptopelia vinacea</taxonName>, were found throughout the whole year.</p>
				<p>In 1926-27, I found this dove very common on the west shore of Lake Albert, but near Ruwenzori it lived only in the dry foothills at the southern end, below 5000 feet.  It frequents likewise the shores of Lake Edward, the Ruindi Plain, the shores of Lake Kivu, and dry areas of the Kivu district, up to 6000 feet.  In the Ruzizi Plain I met with it again, and there are specimens from around Lake Tanganyika, Mlonde in Marungu, and the Bunkeya valley in the Katanga.</p>
				<p>Because of its notes which somewhat resemble human laughter, the species has been called the laughing dove.  The male utters a series of five or six short, low cooing notes, of which the next-to-last is highest pitched, the final coo descending abruptly.  These may be given from a perch or as he courts a female on the ground.  In the Uelle district their
<pb n="154" id="t000120-p00160c.tif"/> cooing was almost never heard in the dry season.  They were especially common about villages.  At Faradje, in the rainy season they used to assemble in large flocks to eat earth on a spot where a magazine for the storage of salt was said to have stood.</p>
				<p>In the Uelle breeding may have begun about July, but only in October did we find definite proof of it.  A nest (October 19) was placed on a forking bough of a small tree, twenty feet up.  It contained two white eggs, 24.4 &times; 19.5 mm. and 25.5 &times; 19.3.  In South Africa nests have been reported in &quot;summer,&quot; November to January.</p>
				<p>Aside from numerous specimens which had been eating salty earth, we examined the crops of five others.  There were always seeds of several varieties, including durra (<taxonName>Sorghum</taxonName>), small beans, and Celosia seeds. Two individuals had eaten termites: a dozen winged examples and two workers.</p>

				<p><taxon><taxonName>Turtur turtur arenicola</taxonName> HARTERT, 1894, Nov. Zool., I, p. 42</taxon> (type locality: Fao on Persian Gulf).</p>
				<p>SPECIMEN.&mdash;Avakubi, &female; im., Oct. 28.</p>
				<p>This is a young turtle-dove apparently of the race which breeds from Turkestan to Persia, Palestine, Morocco, and the oases of the northwestern Sahara.  Its head and body are still clad in the grayish juvenal plumage, and the feathers of the neck show no black anywhere.  Among the scapulars and wing-coverts, however, a number of new feathers have appeared, with the black-centered, rufous-edged feathers which characterize the species <taxonName idx_name="Streptopelia turtur">turtur</taxonName>.  These feathers are lighter-colored than in the young of <taxonName idx_name="Streptopelia turtur turtur">S. t. turtur</taxonName> of the same age, so the" identification as <taxonName idx_name="Streptopelia turtur arenicola">arenicola</taxonName> may be correct.</p>
				<p>The winter wanderings of <taxonName idx_name="Streptopelia turtur arenicola">arenicola</taxonName> are known to extend to northwest India and the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, south perhaps to Renk on the White Nile.  This single bird was shot by Dr. Rosati, in my presence, as it flew over the parade ground at Avakubi; and during my whole stay in the northeastern Congo I never saw another.  It must have an accidental occurrence, but could not have been an escaped cage-bird.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;In highlands from southwestern Arabia, Abyssinia, and Somaliland to Kenya Colony, the Kivu district, Tanganyika Territory, and northern Nyasaland; also in Cameroon highlands and Northern Nigeria.  According to van Someren, it is represented by a smaller and darker race, <taxonName idx_name="Streptopelia lugens funebrea">S. l. funebrea</taxonName>,<note n="1">1919, B. B. O. C., XL, p. 21 (Mt. Elgon).</note> from Mt. Elgon and Kenya Colony southward, but I cannot see that skins from Kenya Colony and west of the Ruzizi Valley are perceptibly darker than those from Abyssinia.<note n="2">Admiral Lynes, 1934, J. f.

				<p><taxon><taxonName idx_name="Streptopelia lugens">S. l. hypopyrrha</taxonName> (Reichenow)</taxon>, on the other hand, is more rufous beneath, and lives isolated in the highlands of the Cameroon and near Jos in Northern Nigeria.</p>
				<p>A note by Emin<note n="1">See stuhlmann, 1922, `Tageb. Emin Pascha,' III, p. 370.</note> that he found &quot;<taxonName>Turtur lugens</taxonName>&quot; at Kibiro on the east shore of Lake Albert was probably based on a misidentification.  <taxonName idx_name="Streptopelia lugens lugens">S. l. lugens</taxonName> is for the most part a dove of mountains, and often of mountain forests.  Count Gyldenstolpe found it fairly abundant in the higher forest regions of the Kivu Volcanoes.  It occurred either in pairs or in small flocks of four to six individuals.  To me it seemed less common there, though it was seen as high as 11,000 feet.  On Ruwenzori and the highland west of Lake Edward we have not found it; but I did secure one in the mountains west of the Ruzizi Valley at 8150 feet.</p>
				<p>In Kenya Colony I noted that this dove gave a rather lengthy coo, deep-toned and hoarse, which was repeated many times.  Dr. van Someren<note n="2">1916, Ibis, p. 212; 1928, Journ. E. Afr. Ug. N. H. Soc., VIII, No. 30, p. 82.</note> reported that eggs were there found during the rains: from March to June and in November.  The nest is a loose structure of twigs on a horizontal fork or at the crossing of two or three branches.  The two eggs are pure white.</p>

				<p>ADULTS.&mdash;Iris dull orange, orbit dark gray, sometimes varied with a little red; bill grayish black; feet light purplish red, claws dusky.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;From the Red Sea coast, Somaliland, and Abyssinia, west to the Niger River and Senegal, as well as south through eastern Africa and the Albertine Rift to the Zambesi. Lake Ngami, and Angola.</p>
				<p>Seven races were recognized by Friedmann,<note n="3">1930, Bull. 153, U. S. Nat. Mus., pp. 219&ndash;224.  Grant and M.-Praed, 1937, B. B. O. C., LVII, pp. 102, 103, would admit only four races.</note> and it now appears that an additional form, <taxonName idx_name="Streptopelia decipiens logonensis">logonensis</taxonName>, may be admitted.  <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Streptopelia decipiens elegans">S. d. elegans</taxonName> (Zedlitz)</taxon> of Southern Somaliland and northern Kenya Colony is the palest race, with wings very short.  <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Streptopelia decipiens perspicillata">S. d. perspicillata</taxonName> (Fischer and Reichenow)</taxon> of arid parts of Tanganyika and the adjacent section of Kenya Colony is nearly as pale, but larger.  Of about the same size but somewhat
<pb n="157" id="t000120-p00163c.tif"/> darker is <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Streptopelia decipiens permista">S. d. permista</taxonName> (Reichenow)</taxon>, ranging from Nyasaland and western Tanganyika Territory to southwestern Abyssinia.  Still a little darker, at least on the underparts, is <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Streptopelia decipiens ambigua">S. d. ambigua</taxonName> (Bocage)</taxon> of southern Angola, Katanga, and the upper Zambesi basin.  Surprisingly similar to ambigua in size and coloration is <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Streptopelia decipiens decipiens">S. d. decipiens</taxonName> (Finsch and Hartlaub)</taxon> of the northern Anglo-Egyptian Sudan and countries west to Lake Chad.  <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Streptopelia decipiens griseiventris">S. d. griseiventris</taxonName> (Erlanger)</taxon> of Northern Somaliland and adjacent districts of Eritrea and Abyssinia is supposedly darker brown on the back, and more strongly washed with gray below.</p>
				<p>Doves of this species likewise inhabit the southern Sudan and the shores of Lake Albert.  They are slightly deeper in color, above and below, than typical <taxonName idx_name="Streptopelia decipiens">decipiens</taxonName>; and for the present the most suitable name seems to be <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Streptopelia decipiens logonensis">S. d. logonensis</taxonName> (Reichenow)</taxon>.  They are not <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Streptopelia decipiens shelleyi">S. d. shelleyi</taxonName> (Salvadori)</taxon>, for that is a large race with light gray alula and primary-coverts, ranging from Nigeria to Senegal.  It bears a most deceptive resemblance to <taxonName idx_name="Streptopelia semitorquata">S. semitorquata</taxonName>.</p>
				<p><taxonName idx_name="Streptopelia decipiens logonensis">S. d. logonensis</taxonName> was named by Reichenow because like all the races of <taxonName idx_name="Streptopelia decipiens">decipiens</taxonName>, save <taxonName idx_name="Streptopelia decipiens shelleyi">shelleyi</taxonName>, it has blackish alula and primary-coverts. Salvadori mentioned these feathers as &quot;black,&quot; but Hartert,<note n="1">1921, Nov. Zool., XXVIII, p. 90.</note> as well as Bannerman and Bates,<note n="2">1924, Ibis, p. 207.</note> was positive that <taxonName idx_name="Streptopelia decipiens shelleyi">shelleyi</taxonName> has gray primary-coverts. This is illustrated by a specimen from Darker in the American Museum, and <taxonName idx_name="Streptopelia decipiens logonensis">logonensis</taxonName> is smaller.  The wings of our six specimens from Lake Albert and Lake Edward measure 157&ndash;164 mm., whereas the West African <taxonName idx_name="Streptopelia decipiens shelleyi">shelleyi</taxonName>, according to Bannerman, has wings 167&ndash;188 mm.</p>
				<p>On the other hand, <taxonName idx_name="Streptopelia decipiens logonensis">logonensis</taxonName> is only slightly darker than <taxonName idx_name="Streptopelia decipiens permista">permista</taxonName> and <taxonName idx_name="Streptopelia decipiens decipiens">decipiens</taxonName>.  It probably ranges from French Equatorial Africa to the Bahr-el-Jebel and Lake Edward, at levels below 4000 feet.  For many years it eluded collectors in the northeastern Congo, though it is partial to lakes and rivers and has a distinctive voice.  In life the orange iris and dark orbit will differentiate it from <taxonName idx_name="Streptopelia capicola">S. capicola</taxonName>.</p>
				<p>At Kasenyi on Lake Albert, on the north shore of Lake Edward, and on the lower Rutshuru Plain it proved to be common.  These doves would perch on a euphorbia or a leafy tree, repeating a double &quot;cu-hoo&quot; or &quot;cuk-hoo&quot; from six to ten times.  These double coos were often introduced by a short &quot;c-coo,&quot; followed by a single rolling &quot;c-c-c-oo,&quot; and then came the series of double notes mentioned above.  Or the rolling &quot;c-c-c-oo&quot; might be given alone.</p>
				<p>From what is known of the nesting of allied races, <taxonName idx_name="Streptopelia decipiens logonensis">S. d. logonensis</taxonName> is
<pb n="158" id="t000120-p00164c.tif"/> likely to build in trees or bushes not far from water, laying two white eggs about 30.5 &times; 22.8 mm.  I took specimens in breeding condition at Kasenyi in early September and near Katwe in January.  The dry periods are probably preferred for reproduction.</p>

				</p>
				<p>There seem to be no records from northern Angola or the Kasai district of the Congo.  In the Katanga, Neave obtained three specimens on the Bunkeya River in July and August, and observed that it is distinctly local, frequenting the banks of rivers on low ground.  In 1937 one adult was collected for the Congo Museum by Professor Brien at Kadia near Lake Kisale.  Its wing measures 162 mm.</p>

				<p>ADULT MALE.&mdash;Iris dark brown, eyelids gray; bill black; feet reddish purple.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;Cape Province north to the Portuguese Congo, the southern and eastern Congo, Uganda, Abyssinia, and northern Somaliland.  Of the six or seven races currently recognized, <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Streptopelia capicola capicola">S. c. capicola</taxonName> (Sundevall)</taxon> is restricted to the region from the Cape to the southern Transvaal.  The pale <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Streptopelia capicola damarensis">S. c. damarensis</taxonName> (Finsch and Hartlaub)</taxon> occupies Southwest Africa, and five other races are perhaps to be recognized over the remainder of the range.</p>
				<p>Of these, only <taxonName idx_name="Streptopelia capicola tropica">tropica</taxonName> and <taxonName idx_name="Streptopelia capicola dryas">dryas</taxonName>, if indeed the latter is valid, are found within our limits.  <taxonName idx_name="Streptopelia capicola tropica">S. c. tropica</taxonName>, moderately pale in color, occupies the area from northern Transvaal to the Portuguese Congo, Kasai, Lake Albert, Mt. Elgon, and Tanganyika Territory.  <taxonName idx_name="Streptopelia capicola dryas">S. c. dryas</taxonName> was described as intermediate in coloration between <taxonName idx_name="Streptopelia capicola">S. capicola</taxonName> and <taxonName idx_name="Streptopelia vinacea">S. vinacea</taxonName>, I have examined the type, which shows some approach toward <taxonName idx_name="Streptopelia vinacea">vinacea</taxonName>, but has the tail pattern of <taxonName idx_name="Streptopelia capicola">capicola</taxonName>.  If <taxonName idx_name="Streptopelia capicola dryas">dryas</taxonName> is separable, it must be restricted to the Kivu district.</p>
				<pb n="160" id="t000120-p00166c.tif"/>
				<p>Specimens from Lake Albert are <taxonName idx_name="Streptopelia capicola tropica">tropica</taxonName>, and my male from Boma has been compared with the type of that race.  In the Lower Congo these ring-doves are common, in the Kasai and Katanga less so; but they are numerous again in the eastern Congo, near Lake Tanganyika, in the Ruzizi Valley, near Lake Kivu, in the Rutshuru Plain, the northern shore of Lake Edward, and the western shore of Lake Albert.  They were even seen at Bogoro on the escarpment above Kasenyi, but do not occur on forested mountains, or much above 5500 feet anywhere in the Congo.</p>
				<p>In the Lower Congo I have listened to their cooing in January, April, and July.  These notes are of at least two kinds: a shorter &quot;cuk-coodle&quot; or &quot;k&ubreve;- kkkkoo,&quot; the first syllable sometimes doubled; and a more continuous &quot;k-k-k-k-kah.&quot;  Both are repeated monotonously, and resemble the notes of <taxonName idx_name="Streptopelia vinacea">S. vinacea</taxonName>.</p>
				<p>Nests of this dove in Uganda have been described as built of twigs and roots in a bush or tree, sometimes even in papyrus or amid creepers against a house.  The two white eggs measure 25.5&ndash;28 mm. &times; 20&ndash;23. The nesting season is very long, but dry periods may be favored.</p>

				<p>ADULTS.&mdash;Iris dark brown, eyelids gray with rim slightly yellowish or greenish; bill black, corners of mouth dark purplish red; feet purplish red, claws dusky.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;Savannas from Senegal to the Bahr-el-Jebel, Shoa, and Eritrea.  The range, as Grote pointed out, is complementary to that of <taxonName idx_name="Streptopelia capicola">S. capicola</taxonName>, and it is possible that the two groups may intergrade in the region between Lake Albert and Mt. Elgon. <taxonName idx_name="Streptopelia vinacea vinacea">S. v. vinacea</taxonName> extends from Senegal to Nigeria in the dry northern areas. The other races are: <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Streptopelia vinacea grotei">S. v. grotei</taxonName> Reichenow</taxon>, upper Benue R. and L.

				<p>Our specimens from the Uelle district may be as near to the deeper-colored <taxonName idx_name="Streptopelia vinacea savann&aelig;">savann&aelig;</taxonName> as they are to <taxonName idx_name="Streptopelia vinacea barbaru">barbaru</taxonName>, and specimens from the Ubangi district may well prove to be <taxonName idx_name="Streptopelia vinacea savann&aelig;">savann&aelig;</taxonName>.  In the northern Congo savannas the vinaceous ring-dove is present only from August or September to the latter part of April.  It is common during the dry season, but arrives in the rainiest part of the year.  The birds can come only from the north, but not from afar, as Lynes did not find the species in Darfur.</p>
				<p>At the proper time of year in the northern Uelle this is a tame, familiar bird, feeding about farms and villages, or perching in trees and giving its incessant cooing.  The notes are of two sorts: a &quot;coo-coodle&quot; or &quot;cudle-coodle&quot; repeated without pause; or a protracted, vibrant &quot;k-k-k-k-koo,&quot; similarly reiterated.  It is looked upon by natives as a harbinger of the drought.</p>
				<p>Breeding begins in early October, but probably continues until February. A nest found at Faradje on October 19, containing two very young squabs, was placed on a bough with radiating twigs, eighteen feet up.  The white eggs should be similar to those of <taxonName idx_name="Streptopelia vinacea vinacea">S. v. vinacea</taxonName>, dimensions of which were given by Bannerman as 24.9&ndash;26 mm. &times; 18.6&ndash;20.</p>
				<p>Crops and stomachs of seven birds contained <taxonName>Eleusine</taxonName> millet, small amounts of durra (<taxonName>Sorghum</taxonName>), quantities of small wild seeds, a few grains of maize, two beans, and in one case thirty-five winged termites and two ticks.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;Senegal, northern Abyssinia, and southwest Arabia to eastern Cape Province, including Pemba I., Zanzibar, and Fernando Po.  Absent only on the highest mountains and in desert areas.</p>
				<p>Over most of this range it is difficult to recognize any races, because of the gradual change in size.  The largest specimens come from Abyssinia, southern Angola, and southeastern Africa.  Attempts have been made to separate a small West African race, <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Streptopelia semitorquata erythrophrys">S. s. erythrophrys</taxonName> (Swainson)</taxon>.<note n="1">1837, `Birds W.

Transvaal Mus., XV, p. 24 (Toten-Maun road, Ngamiland).</note> and <taxonName><taxonName idx_name="Streptopelia semitorquata australis">S. s. australis</taxonName> Roberts</taxonName>.<note n="3">1932," idem, XV, p. 25 (Sekororo, Leydsdorp distr., Transvaal).</note> But no definite limits can be drawn for them.  West African specimens have wings 168&ndash;186 mm.; Congo birds, 172&ndash;192; Abyssinian, 175&ndash;195; those of southern Angola, 181&ndash;196; and South African, 185&ndash;212.  Only in Southern Somaliland and on the East
<pb n="163" id="t000120-p00169c.tif"/> African coast to Zanzibar is there a good pale race of small size, <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Streptopelia semitorquata minor">S. s. minor</taxonName> (Erlanger)</taxon>, with wings 160&ndash;175 mm.</p>
				<p>In the Belgian Congo the wings of <taxonName idx_name="Streptopelia semitorquata semitorquata">semitorquata</taxonName> vary between 172 and 183 mm., except in the southeast, from Luluabourg to Marungu, where they are longer, 176 to 192 mm., including both sexes.</p>
				<p>This large ring-dove is to be seen almost everywhere in the Congo, and it even ascends in forested highlands to 7000 feet.  In the forest belt it lives principally about the clearings and river-banks; in more open country it is abundant, especially where there are many trees.  No other member of the genus invades the lowland forest.</p>
				<p>Its voice is very distinctive, consisting of notes of four different types:</p>
				<p>(1) The most characteristic, of six syllables, the first two loudest, &quot;COO COO, cu-cu coo coo.&quot;</p>
				<p>(2) Shorter, somewhat like a brief reversal of the preceding, &quot;c-c-c-coo, COO COO.&quot;</p>
				<p>(3) A prolonged cooing, low and hoarse, probably associated with courtship.</p>
				<p>(4) A hoarse &quot;kaaaaa.&quot;</p>
				<p>The first two types of notes are repeated over and over.  At times these doves make a steeply rising flight, then suddenly halt, and come sailing down at an angle of 40 degrees.</p>
				<p>At Medje in the forest this dove nests in September, January, and February, if not indeed throughout the year.  At Faradje in the northern savanna three nests were found, on October 26 and December 3, built in the usual dove fashion, all within eight feet of the ground amid thick foliage.  The full set of eggs is always two, pure white, and my measurements are 28.7&ndash;30.6 mm. &times; 23.2&ndash;24.<note n="1">Jackson, 1926, `Game Birds Kenya Uganda,' p. 148, gave 28&ndash;32 mm. &times; 22.5&ndash;25.</note>
				</p>
				<p>Crops and stomachs were examined in six cases, and the food found to consist mainly of seeds, fruits, and starchy plant-material.  It included gourd-seeds, large grass-seeds, small red peppers, plant tubers, and once, 30 winged termites.  Occasionally earth is eaten, as we found near Mount Gaima, in the Uelle.  A hole in the side of a wooded gully attracted numbers of colies to eat the red clay, as well as an occasional dove.  Another cavity, higher up the mountain, was reported to be much more frequented by these doves.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;Annobon, S&atilde;o Tom&eacute;, Princes Island, Fernando Po, forested Liberia and Cameroon, eastern Congo highlands, and forests in Uganda.  Not known from lowland Congo forest.</p>
				<p>Six or seven races are known, of which the males differ but slightly. They are usually grayish, with green or lilac reflections on hind-neck.

<pb n="165" id="t000120-p00171u.tif"/> Sharpe of Southern Cameroon.  The latter race may perhaps extend to the forest of the Ubangi, but has not been collected there.</p>
				<p><taxonName idx_name="Aplopelia simplex jacksoni">Aplopelia s. jacksoni</taxonName> is found above 5000 feet in the eastern Congo, also in the Budongo, Bugoma, and Mabira forests of Uganda, little above 4000 feet.  It must occur in mountain forests west of Lake Albert, in view of Th&eacute;lie&apos;s specimen labeled &quot;Kilo&quot;; it has been collected on Ruwenzori between 6500 and 9000 feet; and I have seen it in the mountains west of Lake Albert at 7300 feet.  No specimen has yet been taken on the Kivu Volcanoes.</p>
				<p>Jackson&apos;s ground-dove lives in the undergrowth of the heavy forest, feeding no doubt on the ground.  It is seldom seen on west Ruwenzori, where I obtained two males; and I did not hear it call.  The crop of one specimen contained round orange-red berries, hard brown seeds, 2 small snails, a bit of a millipede, and 3 small green caterpillars.</p>
				<p>The nest is known to be built in a bush in the forest undergrowth, holding two eggs.<note n="1">Jackson, 1926, `Game Birds Kenya Uganda.' p. 177.</note>  The eggs of <taxonName idx_name="Aplopelia simplex plumbescens">plumbescens</taxonName> in lowland Cameroon were described by Bates as cream-colored, 26.5&ndash;28.5 mm. &times; 20&ndash;22.

				<p>Adult males vary especially in the amount of chestnut on the outer rectrices, and females may differ markedly in the amount of rufous on the breast.

				<p>The bronze-naped pigeon is common throughout the lowland Congo forest and larger gallery forests, extending north to the Uelle River, and south at least to Luluabourg.  I have heard its unmistakable voice at Ganda Sundi in the Mayombe.  It is arboreal, frequenting both virgin forest and second-growth woods, usually keeping well hidden in the foliage, and never in parties.</p>
				<p>It begins its cooing with two to four notes audible at no great distance, continues with four or five very loud coos of uniform tone, then suddenly lowers its voice and finishes with three to five notes a little louder than those at the start.</p>
				<p>The breeding season appears to be during the rains: in the northeastern Congo from June to September, if not to December.  The nest is probably built in old second growth, at a height of fifteen or twenty feet. Bates found one in the Cameroon, but did not secure eggs.</p>
				<p>In the crops and stomachs of six individuals we found only fruit, usually small berries, and soft seeds.  Small bits of stone were noted twice.</p>

				<p>ADULTS.&mdash;Iris orange-red to crimson, naked skin around eye carmine; bill bluish gray, light toward tip, dark at base; feet light blue or bluish gray.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;Western Liberia to the Ubangi River and the forests of Uganda, south to the central Kasai district and Manyema.  In the heavy forest of the Congo it is generally distributed from Kwamouth to the Semliki forest, but not known thus far from the Mayombe.  It does not ascend much above 5000 feet.</p>
				<p>It perches in the tallest tree, often on leafless boughs, so high that it is difficult to shoot.  No more than two or three are seen together. Throughout the year it betrays its presence by a series of seven to twelve deep coos, delivered rather slowly.

				<p>Near Medje, on July 23, 1910, I saw a nest near the top of a tall tree, in a fork of a rather small branch.  As it was seventy feet up, I could only secure the female, which had a pure white egg in its oviduct.  Other females with ovaries enlarged were taken in January, March, and late

				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;From Senegal across the Sudan to Eritrea and Abyssinia; south through the drier parts of East Africa, Uganda, and the eastern Congo border to southern Tanganyika Territory; also from the Transvaal and Mossamedes to Cape Province.</p>

No representative of the species is known from the Katanga district, Nyasaland, or Rhodesia.</p>
				<pb n="169" id="t000120-p00175c.tif"/>
				<p>Within our limits the Guinea pigeon seems to occur only in rather dry areas near lakes Tanganyika, Kivu, and Edward.  Dr. Schouteden tells me that it was particularly numerous in the small dry area near the southeast base of Mt. Karisimbi.  I have seen them near the Lubilia River, north of Lake Edward; and on the northern shore of this same lake Dr. J. C. Phillips obtained a specimen.  Possibly it may be looked for near Lake Albert, and Emin secured it at Wandi within forty-five miles of the Upper Uelle border.</p>
				<p>The Guinea pigeon shows resemblances to the domestic pigeon, with which it has been known to hybridize; but it is less sociable, usually seen in pairs or parties of six to eight.  In the Sudan its distribution is said to follow that of the <taxonName>Borassus</taxonName> palms; in other regions, cliffs or buildings are attractive.  Large trees near villages are often their resting places, and they feed on grain on the ground.  The voice is low and muffled, four to six deep coos being repeated in a guttural tone.</p>
				<p>In Abyssinia and East Africa they have been reported to nest on buildings and beneath bridges, as well as on cliff-sides.  In the Sudan they also build in the leaf-bases of doleib palms, baobabs, or other large trees.  In Nigeria, Hartert reported them as nesting in pots fastened in trees by natives.</p>
				<p>The dry season may be preferred for breeding in the Sudanese belt, where they seem to nest from January to May; but in eastern equatorial Africa there may be greater irregularity.<note n="1">See van Someren, 1928, Journ. E. Afr. Ug. N. H. Soc., VIII, No. 30, p. 76.</note>  The two white eggs measure approximately 36&ndash;37 mm. &times; 27&ndash;28.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;From Cape Province north to Angola, Nyasaland, the highlands of eastern Africa and the eastern Congo border, the mountains of Cameroon, and the island of Fernando Po. The whole area is occupied by the typical race, except for the highlands
<pb n="170" id="t000120-p00176c.tif"/> of Cameroon and Fernando Po, where it is replaced by <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Columba arquatrix sj&ouml;stedti">C. a. sj&ouml;stedti</taxonName> Reichenow</taxon>.<note n="1">1898, J. f. O., p. 138 (Mt. Cameroon).</note>
				</p>
				<p>The forehead, cheeks, and fore-crown in <taxonName idx_name="Columba arquatrix arquatrix">C. a. arquatrix</taxonName> are deep grayish purple; hind-crown and nape gray, varying from slate-gray to very pale ashy gray, apparently without reference to sex; rectrices entirely blackish.  Wings of six males from the eastern Congo, 228&ndash;238 mm., of four females, 223&ndash;232; tails of males 136&ndash;145 mm., of females 135&ndash; 140.  <taxonName idx_name="Columba arquatrix sj&ouml;stedti">C. a. sj&ouml;stedti</taxonName> is very distinct, with smaller bill, darker gray head, and more lengthened whitish markings on chest.</p>
				<p><taxon><taxonName>Columba thomensis</taxonName> Bocage</taxon> of the island of S&atilde;o Tom&eacute; is an allied species, less spotted beneath and with a much longer tail.<note n="2">See Bannerman, 1931, Ibis, pp. 652&ndash;654, Pl. xx.</note>  <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Columba albinucha">C. albinucha</taxonName> Sassi</taxon> of the eastern Congo and <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Columba hodgsonii">C. hodgsonii</taxonName> Vigors</taxon> of the highlands of Asia are other members of the same group.</p>
				<p>While it may descend to sea-level in South Africa, the olive pigeon in Angola, the eastern Congo, and East Africa is mainly a bird of forested highlands.  Sometimes it comes down to levels of 3500 to 4000 feet about the bases of the mountains, but then is apt to be in flocks, and not breeding. The accuracy of records from Beni and Baraka seems doubtful, and in all the central Congo forest it is unknown.  Its true home is in the mountain forests, between 5000 to 10,000 feet, and the species has not yet been found in the Upper Katanga or Marungu.  The southernmost records from Congo territory are in the mountains northwest of Tanganyika.  We may also expect it on the high mountains west of Lake Albert.</p>
				<p>On the western slopes of Ruwenzori it is one of the characteristic birds, a large dark pigeon with yellow bill, very swift and strong in flight. They sometimes flocked into a single tree to feed on a favorite fruit or seed.  Along the mountain ridges west of Lake Edward and the Ruindi Plain I noted flocks going by at Mulu and Upper Kabasha.  On March 27, at the northern end of the Kasali Mountains near the Rutshuru River I was surprised to find several flocks feeding as low as 3700 feet.  Again in the forests on the eastern side of the Rutshuru Plain some were seen at only 4300 to 5000 feet on April 30, and in early May.</p>
				<p>On the higher Kivu Volcanoes they ascend to 11,000 or 12,000 feet, but I did not find them very numerous.  West of the Ruzizi Valley, on Mt. Kandashomwa, they live at 7500 to 9000 feet, and small flocks were twice noticed flying across the Ruzizi Plain.</p>
				<p>The cooing of <taxonName idx_name="Columba arquatrix arquatrix">arquatrix</taxonName> is low and hoarse, with a tremor or quaver, so
<pb n="171" id="t000120-p00177c.tif"/> that it may even break into two or three syllables.  Its carrying power is not great, not at all like that of <taxonName>Columba unicincta</taxonName>.  Count Gyldenstolpe found a nest high on Mt. Karisimbi on March 24, placed about ten feet from the ground in a low tree.  The single hard-set egg was pure white, 41 X 28 mm.  In other parts of eastern Africa the nest has been found from six to twenty feet up, the dimensions of eggs being 37&ndash;41 mm. &times; 27&ndash;30.  A single egg often constitutes the full set, but others of two have been noted.</p>
				<p>On Ruwenzori Woosnam found that in February and March these pigeons were feeding on berries of the African yew (<taxonName>Podocarpus</taxonName>).  I noticed also that they are very fond of the hard seeds of <taxonName>Croton macrostachys</taxonName>, which resemble small castor-oil seeds.  A variety of other fruits and seeds are consumed, wild olives, wild figs, and fruits of <taxonName>Toddalia</taxonName>, <taxonName>Teclea</taxonName>, and <taxonName>Trema</taxonName>.  Whether it was because of the food or not, the flesh of these pigeons seemed always dark-colored and bitter.  In their gizzards we sometimes found a single large piece of white quartz, one measuring 14 mm. in length.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;Eastern border of the Ituri forest, from the vicinity of Kilo south at least to Beni.  It may be expected to range somewhat farther southward, but cannot be widely distributed in the eastern Congo forest, for we never saw it during our long stay about Avakubi and Medje.  The localities where it has been taken are mostly at altitudes between 3000 and 4000 feet, thickly forested.</p>
				<p>While bearing a certain resemblance to <taxonName idx_name="Columba arquatrix">C. arquatrix</taxonName>, the present species is without light spots on the upper wing-coverts, distinctly smaller (wing 196&ndash;200 mm.; tail 125&ndash;130); and the rectrices light gray, still paler on the outer half.  The light patch on the hind-crown is not always white, but in some specimens bluish gray.  The latter color may distinguish the females and young.  The bill is red, darker basally, whereas that of <taxonName idx_name="Columba arquatrix">arquatrix</taxonName> is yellow.</p>
				<p>It seems probable that the white-naped pigeon is not so rare as the scanty museum material might indicate.  Yet Gyldenstolpe obtained
<pb n="172" id="t000120-p00178c.tif"/> only one female specimen, and my own efforts in 1926 and 1927 were totally unsuccessful.  In a forest patch just west of Irumu I did hear an unfamiliar, hoarse coo, rather like that of arquatrix, and saw three or four pigeons feeding in the trees.  These were so shy that I could not shoot one, and I believe they may well have been <taxonName idx_name="Columba albinucha">albinucha</taxonName>.  In view of the known distribution of <taxonName idx_name="Columba albinucha">albinucha</taxonName>, it is surprising that it has not been found in the forests of Uganda.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;From Senegal and the Casamance River east through Northern Nigeria to the Egyptian Sudan, Abyssinia, Somaliland, the island of Socotra, Aden Protectorate, and Yemen.  The southern limit of the species scarcely touches the northern Congo, save in the vicinity of Lake Albert and perhaps in the northeastern Uelle.  It was known from Lado, Gondokoro, and Wadelai on the Bahr-el-Jebel, and Dr. Schouteden has collected three specimens at Mahagi Port, at the northern end of Lake Albert.</p>
				<p>On May 2, 1912, between Faradje and Garamba, I saw a couple of fruit-pigeons which I believed to be the yellow-bellied <taxonName idx_name="Vinago waalia">V. waalia</taxonName>; but all the others I observed in this region were plainly <taxonName idx_name="Vinago calva">calva</taxonName>.  Boyd Alexander<note n="2">1907, `From the Niger to the Nile,' II, p. 308.</note> wrote of finding <taxonName idx_name="Vinago waalia">waalia</taxonName> in numbers near Mt.

				<pb n="173" id="t000120-p00179c.tif"/>
				<p>In the Lado district, according to Emin, Bruce&apos;s green pigeon is found in small parties, frequenting patches of thick-foliaged trees in the plain, especially where wild figs and berries are to be had.  As one approaches, the green pigeons fly out of the opposite side of the trees with a swift but noisy flight.</p>
				<p>The voice is like that of <taxonName>Vinago calva</taxonName>; and according to Hutson it commences with a &quot;gurrh,&quot; followed by a series of yap-yap-yaps and rattling parrh-parrh-parrhs.  In West Africa the breeding season is from December to May, and in Darfur Lynes<note n="1">1925, Ibis, p. 579.</note> collected a very young bird on April 1.  The flimsy nest of twigs and rootlets is commonly placed far out on a leafy bough.  Dimensions of the white eggs are given by Nehrkorn as 30&ndash;31 mm. &times; 22&ndash;23.</p>

				<p>ADULTS.&mdash;Iris light blue; basal half of bill and swollen skin of forehead bright scarlet, distal half of bill pale bluish gray; feet yellow with claws light gray.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;From the Gambia, the Shari River, the Bahr-el-Ghazal Province, and southwestern Abyssinia, south through almost the entire width of the continent to Great Namaqualand and Griqualand West.  Also on Fernando Po and Princes Island.  If <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Vinago delalandii">V. delalandii</taxonName> (Bonaparte)</taxon>, with greenish-gray breast, is also to be regarded as a race of <taxonName idx_name="Vinago calva">calva</taxonName>&mdash;and this seems possible&mdash;then the range of the species extends south through Portuguese East Africa to the coast of Natal and eastern Cape Province.  Grote (1931) argued that all these forms are subspecies of <taxon><taxonName>Treron australis</taxonName> (Linn&aelig;us)</taxon>; but I am still convinced that the Madagascan green fruit-pigeon is specifically distinct.</p>
				<p><taxonName>Vinago calva</taxonName> is a lowland bird, inhabiting forest and savannas, ascending but little beyond 6000 feet.  It is divisible into approximately fourteen races.  In the northern and western forms the upper surface of the tail is gray, but it becomes washed with green in the southeastern representatives.  Other subspecific characters include the relative yellowness of head and breast, the distinctness of the gray collar on hind-neck, and the fleshy frontal cere, which when highly developed is generally larger in the male sex.</p>
				<p>The races of the West African forests have the deepest green coloration and largest red cere.  Forested Upper Guinea has <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Vinago calva">V. c. sharpei</taxonName> Reichenow</taxon>; the drier area of Portuguese Guinea and Gambia, <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Vinago calva nudirostris">nudirostris</taxonName> Swainson</taxon>; Fernando Po, <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Vinago calva poensis">poensis</taxonName> (Hartert and Goodson)</taxon>.</p>
				<p><taxonName idx_name="Vinago calva calva">V. c. calva</taxonName> is a deep green forest race, with very large red cere, 11&ndash;17 mm. long, and with very little gray on hind-neck.  Wings 150&ndash;164 mm. It ranges from the Cameroon-Gaboon coast, Lower Congo, and northern Angola across the Congo basin to the eastern Ituri and the Manyema district.  In the savannas just to the north lives <taxonName><taxonName idx_name="Vinago calva uellensis">uellensis</taxonName> Reichenow</taxonName>, differing but slightly in its more yellowish-green head and breast.  To the east of the Congo forest lives <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Vinago calva salvadorii">salvadorii</taxonName> Dubois</taxon>, still more yellowish
<pb n="175" id="t000120-p00181c.tif"/> green on head and breast, with more distinct gray collar, wings about 160&ndash; 170 mm., fairly well-developed cere (9&ndash;13 mm. long), but feet red in life.  In all the races previously mentioned the feet are yellow.  The only other race known from the Congo is <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Vinago calva chobiensis">chobiensis</taxonName> Roberts</taxon>, like <taxonName idx_name="Vinago calva salvadorii">salvadorii</taxonName>, but with wings 171&ndash;180 mm., tail more greenish, red cere 8&ndash;9 mm.  It is found from Marungu and Katanga to the middle Zambesi.</p>
				<p>The remaining races are <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Vinago calva granviki">granviki</taxonName> (Grote)</taxon>, from the southeastern shores of Lake Victoria to central Tanganyika Territory, doubtfully valid; <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Vinago calva brevicera">brevicera</taxonName> (Hartert and Goodson)</taxon>, of East Africa east of the Rift Valley; <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Vinago calva ansorgei">ansorgei</taxonName> (Hartert and Goodson)</taxon>, of Angola south of the Kwanza Valley; <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Vinago calva vylderi">vylderi</taxonName> (Gyldenstolpe)</taxon>, of Southwest Africa; <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Vinago calva wakefieldi">wakefieldi</taxonName> (Sharpe)</taxon>, coastlands of East Africa; <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Vinago calva schalowi">schalowi</taxonName> (Reichenow)</taxon>, supposedly from Kimberley; and <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Vinago calva damarensis">damarensis</taxonName> Reichenow</taxon>, from the Okavango River.  The last three are green-tailed, but <taxonName idx_name="Vinago calva wakefieldi">wakefieldi</taxonName> is not a distinct species, as is evident from the transition seen in <taxonName idx_name="Vinago calva salvadorii">salvadorii </taxonName>and <taxonName idx_name="Vinago calva chobiensis">chobiensis</taxonName>.</p>
				<p>Three additional forms often segregated under <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Vinago delalandii">V. delalandii</taxonName> (Bonaparte)</taxon> are also probably races of <taxonName idx_name="Vinago calva">V. calva</taxonName>.</p>
				<p>The range of <taxonName idx_name="Vinago calva calva">V. c. calva</taxonName> in the Congo includes the whole of the equatorial forest and extends southward through the Kasai district and Lower Congo to northern Angola.  It is difficult to draw a line, on the northern border of the forest, between <taxonName idx_name="Vinago calva calva">calva</taxonName> and <taxonName idx_name="Vinago calva uellensis">uellensis</taxonName>.  In habits they are so alike that they may best be considered together.</p>
				<p>In the forest, flocks of twenty to forty green fruit-pigeons are frequently seen flying swiftly overhead.  They alight in the high trees of virgin forest, but seem far more fond of the second growth where the parasol tree (<taxonName>Musanga</taxonName>) is so common, furnishing abundant food.</p>
				<p>The tall trees and strips of woods along streams are their favorite haunts in the savannas.  Far overhead these fruit-pigeons may look surprisingly small, till the field glass suddenly reveals their" identity.  As a flock leaves a tree their flight is very noisy.  Their undove-like voice is readily remembered with the aid of the following sentence: &quot;OH WELL, VERY WELL; GETTING RICH, GETTING RICH; (soft, low, musical) (harsh, quick) THAT'S SO, THAT'S SO.&quot; (fainter, slower)</p>
				<p>This may be followed by a few additional clucks; or the series is sometimes abbreviated and stops after the first &quot;getting rich.&quot;</p>
				<p>Never have I known green pigeons to come to the ground except in bare spots of ground in the forest, swampy during the rains, known locally
<pb n="176" id="t000120-p00182c.tif"/> as &quot;&egrave;do&apos;s.&quot;  They seem to come in parties to eat earth, and are trapped there by natives.</p>
				<p>Every one of our adult specimens had gonads more or less enlarged. In the Ituri, nests or young were found from July to December, and breeding may go on through the whole year.  In the savannas of the Uelle nesting takes place at least from August to December, but may be interrupted in the dry season.</p>
				<p>The nests of <taxonName idx_name="Vinago calva calva">V. c. calva</taxonName> and <taxonName idx_name="Vinago calva uellensis">uellensis</taxonName> are frail structures of dry sticks, generally in a fork of a small tree in second growth.  I have never seen more than a single white egg or nestling.  Bates gave measurements of eggs of <taxonName idx_name="Vinago calva calva">calva</taxonName> as 28&ndash;33 mm. X 22&ndash;25.  My own measurements for <taxonName idx_name="Vinago calva calva">calva</taxonName> and <taxonName idx_name="Vinago calva uellensis">uellensis</taxonName> fall within these limits.</p>
				<p>Except for earth, probably eaten at times, these pigeons restrict their diet to fruit: wild figs, the fruit of the parasol tree, and various berries and other fruits.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;Countries east of the Congo forest, from Unyoro and Mount Elgon south to the shores of Lake Tanganyika.  It is not quite certain that <taxonName idx_name="Vinago calva salvadorii">salvadorii</taxonName> inhabits the western shore of Lake Albert north to Mahagi.  Specimens from Kilo should certainly be closer to
<pb n="178" id="t000120-p00184c.tif"/> <taxonName idx_name="Vinago calva uellensis">uellensis</taxonName>, and in the Semliki Valley I should expect <taxonName idx_name="Vinago calva salvadorii">salvadorii</taxonName> to live only in the grasslands.</p>
				<p>At Kitehe in the Rutshuru Plain and at Lulenga near Mt. Mikeno, I have collected undoubted examples of this race.  From the highland northwest of Lake Tanganyika, <taxonName idx_name="Vinago calva salvadorii">salvadorii</taxonName> and <taxonName idx_name="Vinago calva calva">calva</taxonName> are both reported; and while <taxonName idx_name="Vinago calva salvadorii">salvadorii</taxonName> may inhabit the lowlands west of that lake, a female from the Marungu highland at 6000 feet is <taxonName idx_name="Vinago calva chobiensis">chobiensis</taxonName>.  I doubt the validity of <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Vinago calva granviki">V. c. granviki</taxonName> (Grote)</taxon>, since Dubois&apos;s type of <taxonName idx_name="Vinago calva salvadorii">salvadorii</taxonName> probably came from the southern shores of Lake Tanganyika near Karema or Mpala.</p>
				<p>In voice and habits <taxonName idx_name="Vinago calva salvadorii">salvadorii</taxonName> is like <taxonName idx_name="Vinago calva calva">calva</taxonName>, but usually found in smaller parties.  Small wild figs are a favorite food, but other fruits are undoubtedly eaten.  According to Jackson its nest is the usual frail platform of twigs, usually containing a single white egg, about 31.5 X 23 mm.  A second egg may occasionally be laid.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;Senegal and Abyssinia south to the Cape Province, but virtually absent from many forested sections in the Congo.  Along the coast of East Africa black-breasted examples occur, known as <taxonName><taxonName idx_name="Clamator albonotatus">albonotatus</taxonName> Shelley</taxonName>, but apparently mutants.  The type of <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Clamator caroli">caroli</taxonName> (Norman)</taxon> from the Gaboon seems to be an individual lacking chest-streaks.<note n="1">See Stresemann, 1924, J. f.

				<p>At Avakubi I saw but one example, collected by Dr. Rosati; but near the northern border of the Ituri forest they became more frequent. The species occurs commonly in the Uelle, and in most other lowland savannas of the Congo.  The call, heard frequently in the rainy season, commences with a hollow-toned &quot;kur, kur, kur&mdash;,&quot; the syllables repeated about a dozen times.  Then the bird hesitates a moment, and changes abruptly to a rapid series of short notes like &quot;kw&ibreve;,&quot; about twenty in all, dying away at the end.</p>
				<p>From the eastern Congo border I have seen nestlings taken in May and October.  The eggs are known to be uniform greenish blue, 25&ndash; 26 mm. &times; 20.5&ndash;21, and in South Africa they are laid in nests of <taxonName>Turdoides jardinii</taxonName>, the eggs of which are similarly colored.  At Beni on October 10, 1927, a native hunter brought me a young <taxonName idx_name="Clamator cafer">C. cafer</taxonName>, just able to fly, which he had found in company with an adult male forest babbler, <taxonName>Phyllanthus atripennis bohndorffi</taxonName>.  The young cuckoo was so rufous that he took it for the young of the babbler.<note n="2">See Jourdain, 1925, P. Z. S. London, pp. 639&ndash;667.</note>  Other specimens of <taxonName idx_name="Clamator cafer">C. cafer</taxonName> in juvenal dress are far less rufous, and all lack the distinct light tips on rectrices.</p>
				<p>The stomachs of nine specimens of this cuckoo contained caterpillars in every case, while one had eaten two grasshoppers, and another a winged ant.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;Ceylon, India, and Africa from Senegal to Eritrea, south through eastern Africa to the Cape, also to Angola, the Gaboon coast, and S&atilde;o Tom&eacute;.  Not found in the Congo forest, nor on high mountains.</p>
				<p>The white-breasted birds of Africa can scarcely be distinguished from typical <taxonName idx_name="Clamator jacobinus">jacobinus</taxonName> of India, although Hartert<note n="1">1915, Nov. Zool., XXII, p. 254.</note> separated them as <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Clamator jacobinus pica">C. j. pica</taxonName> Hemprich and Ehrenberg</taxon>.  South of the Zambesi many individuals are grayer below, more streaked on throat and fore-neck. These are <taxonName idx_name="Clamator jacobinus hypopinarus">C. j. hypopinarus</taxonName>, found sparingly north to the northeastern Congo and even southern Abyssinia, perhaps as migrants.  The black-breasted <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Clamator jacobinus serratus">serratus</taxonName> (Sparrman</taxon>) of extreme South Africa is perhaps a color-phase rather than a true race,<note n="2">See Stresemann, 1924, J. f. O., pp. 79&ndash;83; and Godfrey, 1934, Ool. Rec., XIV, pp. 67&ndash;69.</note> and examples with this coloration have been reported from southern Abyssinia, French Equatorial Africa, and the Gold Coast.</p>
				<p>In the Congo <taxonName idx_name="Clamator jacobinus jacobinus">jacobinus</taxonName> is limited mainly to the eastern and southern savannas, not yet known from the Uelle district.  Our nine skins from the Kasai were all taken between November and April, and among them is a young bird with remiges and rectrices not fully grown, taken at Luluabourg on January 15.  Eggs laid by <taxonName idx_name="Clamator jacobinus">jacobinus</taxonName> in Northeast Africa are greenish, as they are in India.  Erlanger<note n="3">1905, J. f. O., p. 483.</note> found them in nests of <taxonName>Argya rubiginosa</taxonName> and <taxonName>Pycnonotus</taxonName> and gave measurements as 22.1&ndash;25 mm. &times; 19.2&ndash;21.  It has been suggested that white-breasted Indian birds may winter in East Africa, but some certainly breed in the western Sudan.<note n="4">See Paludan, 1936, Vidensk. Medd. Dansk naturh. Foren, C, p. 92; also Moreau, 1937 Tang.

				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;Breeds in Cape Province, Natal, and perhaps adjacent districts of South Africa, migrating northward in February and March, returning in September and October.  It is found in Southern Rhodesia and Nyasaland during part of the year, and specimens
<pb n="183" id="t000120-p00189c.tif"/> are known from the base of Ruwenzori (May), Kenya Colony, and southern Abyssinia (April).  Dr. Schouteden&apos;s specimens, taken in late April and May, seem to be correctly" identified; and there is another skin like them in the Congo Museum from the Katanga.</p>
				<p>This race must therefore migrate to the savannas of the eastern Congo, and possibly occasional specimens of the black-breasted phase &quot;<taxonName idx_name="Clamator jacobinus serratus">serratus</taxonName>,&quot; will also be found to occur there.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;Spain to the Persian Gulf, south through Africa to Cape Province, but rare or absent in heavy forests of western and central Africa.  Many of those found in Africa may be migrants from the north, yet some are known to breed even as far north as Sierra Leone, Darfur, and Somaliland.</p>
				<p>At Landana, Petit believed the majority to be migrants; and this may be true for the Congo, where the great spotted cuckoo is rare. In the Congo Museum there are skins from Blukwa, west of Lake Albert, and Buta in the Lower Uelle.  South African birds may also migrate toward the equator.</p>
				<p>In Somaliland, Lort Phillips found this cuckoo&apos;s eggs in the nest of <taxonName>Rhinocorax rhipidurus</taxonName>; in South Africa it lays bluish eggs, speckled with reddish brown or blackish, 32&ndash;34 mm. &times; 24.5&ndash;26.5, in nests of <taxonName>Corvus albus</taxonName>, <taxonName>Corvus capensis</taxonName>, <taxonName>Onychognathus morio</taxonName>, <taxonName>Lamprocolius nitens</taxonName>, and <taxonName>Spreo bicolor</taxonName>.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;Madagascar, and Africa from Togoland to the southern Bahr-el-Ghazal, Tana River, and south to southern Angola and the eastern Transvaal.

				<p><taxonName idx_name="Pachycoccyx audeberti validus">P. a. validus</taxonName> is always a rare bird, though occurring perhaps throughout the Congo lowlands; and probably a bird of gallery forests more often than of heavy forest.  I have seen it three times in the Uelle.  A pair near Niangara was flying high in the air with shrill whistled calls, alighting in the tops of tall trees.  Their appearance was strangely hawk-like.</p>

				<p>SPECIMENS.&mdash;Avakubi, &female;, Apr. 17.  Dungu, &female;, Feb. 22.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;<taxonName idx_name="Cuculus canorus canorus">Cuculus c. canorus</taxonName> breeds from Europe to the Caucasus and Asia Minor, migrating southward into Africa as far as the Transvaal.  While found more commonly in eastern Africa, it also visits West Africa, and some of the migrants must cross the Congo forest.  One of our specimens was taken in the Ituri forest, and I believe I saw one at Lukolela.  Otherwise all the Congo records are from the savanna districts.</p>
				<p>Both our specimens are in the rufous phase, but gray birds are far more common.  The racial status of many Congo specimens is still doubtful, and the two reported from the old Mission St. Gustave and Ngoma may well be <taxonName idx_name="Cuculus canorus telephonus">telephonus</taxonName>.  European cuckoos seem to reach the Congo in September, some wintering even in the Uelle; and a few remain until April.</p>

				<p>This small race was first reported by Stresemann from the southeast shore of Lake Tanganyika.  Two immature females from Karema and South Ufipa had wings only 192 and 197 mm. long.  An adult female in the Congo Museum, from Tembwe on the west shore, with

				<p>ADULTS.&mdash;Iris yellow (male) or light brown (female), rim of eyelids yellow; outer part of bill blackish, base orange-yellow, corners of mouth and whole interior of mouth reddish orange; feet yellow.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;From Natal and Great Namaqualand northward to Abyssinia, the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, the vicinity of Lake Chad, and the Gambia River.  But it does not enter the equatorial forests, and I have seen no specimen from the Kasai district.</p>
				<p><taxonName idx_name="Cuculus gularis">C. gularis</taxonName> is closely allied to <taxonName idx_name="Cuculus canorus">canorus</taxonName>, but its juvenal plumage seems much grayer and its voice distinctly different.  The soft unaccented &quot;coo - coo&quot; of the male <taxonName idx_name="Cuculus gularis">gularis</taxonName> is very similar to the call of a hoopoe. Once I heard a female give a ringing &quot;kip-ip-p-p-p!&quot;  Our seven specimens had eaten nothing but caterpillars.</p>
				<p>In the Upper Uelle the gray African cuckoo is common in the savannas during the dry season, and seems to breed there.  Arriving toward December, and regarded by natives as the harbinger of drought, it usually leaves in early May, no doubt going northward.<note n="3">See Lynes, 1925, Ibis, p. 355, for occurrence in Darfur.</note>  In South Africa the species is found only from October to March, and probably migrates toward the equator.</p>

				<p>ADULTS.&mdash;Iris dark brown, rim of eyelids yellow; maxilla and tip of mandible blackish, remainder of mandible dull yellowish green, corners of mouth yellow to orange; feet yellow or orange-yellow.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;From Cape Town to Abyssinia and the Gambia, avoiding only the most arid parts of the continent and the tops of high mountains.  In the Congo it is almost ubiquitous, in the savanna areas preferring gallery forests and ascending forested mountains to at least 8000 feet.</p>
				<p>Although Professor Stresemann<note n="1">1924, J. f. O., pp. 73&ndash;77.</note> at one time regarded <taxonName idx_name="Cuculus solitarius">solitarius</taxonName> as a mutant of the <taxonName idx_name="Cuculus clamosus">clamosus</taxonName> group, we now know it to be a species easily distinguished by its usual call of three whistled syllables descending the scale.  This has won it the name of &quot;Mak - bak - bo&quot; among the Medje. Another note less often heard is a high-pitched &quot;quick quick quick quick!&quot; Noisy at the beginning of the rains and for about seven months thereafter, the red-chested cuckoo seems not to be migratory in the Congo, though it is known to visit South Africa only in the southern summer.</p>
				<p>Eggs are laid in the northeastern Congo during the period when the birds call.  One from the oviduct of a bird taken near Medje was pale greenish white, thickly spotted with browns of varying shades.  From South Africa only chocolate-brown eggs are reported, but in East Africa some are said to be plain blue.  In the Congo the birds victimized by <taxonName idx_name="Cuculus solitarius">C. solitarius</taxonName> are unknown; in Uganda Dr. van Someren listed <taxonName idx_name=" Motacilla aguimp vidua">Motacilla a. vidua</taxonName>, <taxonName>Pycnonotus tricolor</taxonName>, and <taxonName>Atimastillas flavicollis</taxonName>.  Stoneham mentioned <taxonName>Saxicola torquata</taxonName>, and Jeffery, <taxonName>Anthus leucophrys</taxonName>.</p>
				<p>The juvenal plumage of <taxonName idx_name="Cuculus solitarius">C. solitarius</taxonName> is always barred on the lower breast, blackish above, with a white patch on the nape.  That of all races of <taxonName idx_name="Cuculus clamosus">C. clamosus</taxonName> is wholly black.  Once these cuckoos leave their fosterers they feed mainly on caterpillars, but we found beetles and a winged ant as well in their stomachs.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;Eastern Cape Province to Abyssinia, the Sudan, and Gambia.  <taxonName idx_name="Cuculus clamosus clamosus">C. c. clamosus</taxonName>, with males almost wholly black, occupies South Africa, extending north to Abyssinia, possibly as a migrant.  Occasional specimens have been reported from the Sudanese belt, west to Sierra Leone; but young birds of other races have caused much confusion.  Undoubted specimens of <taxonName idx_name="Cuculus clamosus clamosus">clamosus</taxonName> have been collected near Elisabethville and Kinda in the southeastern Congo.  Others from Funda Biabo and Lukafu show the beginning of intergradation with the next race.</p>
				<p><taxonName idx_name="Cuculus clamosus jacksoni">C. c. jacksoni</taxonName> has throat and chest more or less rufous, the lower breast barred.  It occupies the savannas of the southern Congo, Uganda, and the southern Sudan.  <taxonName idx_name="Cuculus clamosus gabonensis">C. c. gabonensis</taxonName>, somewhat lighter below, occupies the forests of the Gaboon, Cameroon, and Congo; and <taxonName idx_name="Cuculus clamosus mabir&aelig;">C. c. mabir&aelig;</taxonName> is a rather doubtful form with still paler underparts, occurring in Uganda and the Belgian Congo.</p>
				<p>The habits and voice of typical <taxonName idx_name="Cuculus clamosus clamosus">clamosus</taxonName> are like those of <taxonName idx_name="Cuculus clamosus jacksoni">jacksoni</taxonName>. In South Africa the former is said to lay white eggs, sometimes finely spotted with reddish brown and gray, in nests of <taxonName>Andropadus importunus</taxonName> and <taxonName>Laniarius rufiventris</taxonName>.

				<pb n="191" id="t000120-p00197c.tif"/>
				<p>ADULTS.&mdash;Iris dark brown, eyelids dusky (not yellow); bill blackish; feet pale flesh-color, with larger scales near tips of toes dark brownish, claws blackish.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;Northwest Cameroon to Uelle district, southern Bahr-el-Ghazal, and southern Abyssinia; also to Mt. Kenya, Uganda, and the savannas of the eastern and southern Congo to the northern Katanga and Ndala Tando, Angola.  It is thus intermediate geographically and in coloration between <taxonName idx_name="Cuculus clamosus clamosus">clamosus</taxonName> and <taxonName idx_name="Cuculus clamosus gabonensis">gabonensis</taxonName>.  In the eastern Congo <taxonName idx_name="Cuculus clamosus jacksoni">jacksoni</taxonName> does not ascend the forested mountain slopes above 5000 feet and seems to avoid the Kivu plateau.</p>
				<p>Variation in color is pronounced, males being more apt than females to have a large patch of chestnut on throat and chest.  Specimens from north and south of the Congo forest are very much alike.  Jackson&apos;s cuckoo frequents gallery forests, but also perches in the larger savanna trees.</p>
				<p>Its calls, heard frequently in the Uelle from April to June, the early rainy season, are exactly like those of <taxonName idx_name="Cuculus clamosus clamosus">clamosus</taxonName> and <taxonName idx_name="Cuculus clamosus gabonensis">gabonensis</taxonName>. They are of two kinds: three slowly whistled syllables rising in pitch, like &quot;kwa, KWA, KWA&quot;; and a sort of hoarse whistling, paired syllables repeated about ten times, at first increasing in volume, then dying away, which Bates called the &quot;hurry-hurry&quot; call.  The first-mentioned whistled call is repeated monotonously, the second less often heard.</p>
				<p>The female taken at Faradje on May 7 had an uncalcified egg in her oviduct, and she had in the stomach pieces of the egg of some small bird.  Otherwise the four stomachs examined held only caterpillars, most of them hairy.</p>

				<p>SPECIMENS.&mdash;Avakubi, &male;, Mar. 21; &female;, Apr. 14.  Medje, &male;, June 2.  Niangara, &male;, May 8.  Nzoro, &male;, Apr. 23.</p>
				<p>ADULTS.&mdash;Iris dark brown; bill blackish; feet buffy on metatarsi, often shading gradually to dusky brown at tips of toes.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;Heavily forested regions from Togoland to the Cameroon, Mayombe, eastern Congo, and the Kasai district.  Around the borders of the forest, specimens referable to <taxonName idx_name="Cuculus clamosus gabonensis">gabonensis</taxonName> and to <taxonName idx_name="Cuculus clamosus jacksoni">jacksoni</taxonName> may be found in the same locality.  Intergradation is complete, but the white basal barring on the outer webs of some primaries, characteristic of <taxonName idx_name="Cuculus clamosus jacksoni">jacksoni</taxonName> is usually wanting in <taxonName idx_name="Cuculus clamosus gabonensis">gabonensis</taxonName>.</p>
				<p>The Gaboon cuckoo lives in the tall forest trees, in the same places as <taxonName idx_name="Cuculus solitarius">C. solitarius</taxonName>, the latter being more common.  The voice of <taxonName idx_name="Cuculus clamosus gabonensis">gabonensis</taxonName> cannot be distinguished from that of <taxonName idx_name="Cuculus clamosus jacksoni">jacksoni</taxonName>.</p>
				<p>At Avakubi the breeding season seemed to coincide with the rains, and a female with ovary enlarged had eaten the light blue egg of some small bird.  The eggs of <taxonName idx_name="Cuculus clamosus gabonensis">gabonensis</taxonName> are known only from two taken by Bates from oviducts.  They were creamy white, with spots and speckles of dull purplish or reddish brown and lilac-gray.  One measured 23.5 &times; 17 mm.</p>
				<p>The usual food is caterpillars, often hairy.  They were found in all five stomachs examined, and only two birds had eaten other insects, in one case winged ants.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;Forests of Uganda, supposedly, where it has been said to live alongside <taxonName idx_name="Cuculus clamosus jacksoni">C. c. jacksoni</taxonName>.  I doubt if it is a valid race, for it is plainly allied to <taxonName idx_name="Cuculus clamosus gabonensis">gabonensis</taxonName>, much less barred below, and I have seen specimens resembling <taxonName idx_name="Cuculus clamosus mabir&aelig;">mabir&aelig;</taxonName> from Baraka on Lake Tanganyika and even from Lukolela on the Congo River.  Many specimens of <taxonName idx_name="Cuculus clamosus gabonensis">gabonensis</taxonName> from the Upper Congo are not so regularly and heavily barred beneath as those from the Cameroon.

				<p>ADULTS.&mdash;Iris dark brown, rim of eyelids and corners of mouth lemon-yellow; maxilla black, mandible dull greenish with blackish tip; feet chrome-yellow.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;From Sierra Leone to Cameroon and northern Angola, eastward across the Congo to the forests of Uganda, and doubtless to the northern Manyema district.  Primarily a bird of lowland forest, ranging out into gallery forests of the Uelle and doubtless also the Kasai.  I have heard it at 5200 feet in forest east of the Rutshuru Plain, but it seldom goes higher.</p>
				<p>Mechow&apos;s cuckoo is an elusive bird, not rare, frequenting the lower boughs of forest trees, often near watercourses, and sometimes in tall second growth.  Its presence is usually made known by its whistled &quot;wheet-wheet-wheet,&quot; with all three notes in the same high key. Occasionally, it gives a more protracted series of short silvery whistles, descending the scale slightly.  Only the males seem to call.  During the drier part of the year, at Avakubi and at Lukolela, they are seldom heard.</p>
				<pb n="194" id="t000120-p00200c.tif"/>
				<p>The breeding season comes in the first half of the rains, April to July in the Ituri.

				<p>Nine out of ten stomachs examined held caterpillars, some of them hairy.  Other insects were found twice, also one small snail with hard shell.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;Mountain forests above 5000 feet, from Ruwenzori south to Lake Tanganyika and the highlands southwest of Lake Nyasa, also the Uluguru and Usambara Mountains in eastern Tanganyika Territory.  Typical <taxonName idx_name="Cercococcyx montanus montanus">montanus</taxonName> is found in the eastern Congo, while <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Cercococcyx montanus patulus">C. m. patulus</taxonName> Friedmann</taxon><note n="2">1928, Proc. New Eng. Zool. Cl., X, p. 84 (Bagilo, Uluguru Mts.).</note> is believed to extend from Usambara to South Angoniland.  The latter race has the brownish markings of upperparts more extensive, dark bars on breast more widely spaced, and the wing probably longer, 148, 149 mm.  <taxonName idx_name="Cercococcyx montanus montanus">C. m. montanus</taxonName> has wings 134&ndash;145 mm., tail 182&ndash;201.</p>
				<p>In forested highlands of the eastern Congo <taxonName idx_name="Cercococcyx montanus">montanus</taxonName> is often a common cuckoo, to judge from what I feel sure are its notes.  One recalls the triple whistle of <taxonName idx_name="Cercococcyx mechowi">mechowi</taxonName>, but it is usually of four syllables: &quot;see which-fits-best.&quot;  This phrase is reiterated without pause.  Rarely it is shortened to three syllables, occasionally prolonged to five.  At other times a call is given which suggests <taxonName idx_name="Cercococcyx olivinus">C. olivinus</taxonName>, a &quot;whow, whow&quot; that soon becomes doubled to &quot;three-cow, three-cow&mdash;&quot; and lasts ten or fifteen seconds.  Or again, a leisurely &quot;you-too&quot; may be repeated indefinitely.</p>
				<p>On Ruwenzori we heard these notes from 5300 to 9000 feet, in December and January; at Mulu, 8100&ndash;8300 feet, northwest of Lake Edward, the birds were calling in March.  Among the Kivu Volcanoes and west of the Ruzizi, in June and July, none were heard.  Yet Grauer collected nine specimens northwest of Lake Tanganyika and one on Wau
<pb n="195" id="t000120-p00201c.tif"/> Island, Lake Kivu, while the Congo Museum has one from Kigezi, British Ruanda, obtained by Jackson.</p>
				<p>In juvenal plumage the three species of <taxonName>Cercococcyx</taxonName> are more different than when adult.  <taxonName idx_name="Cercococcyx mechowi">C. mechowi</taxonName> is regularly barred below, <taxonName idx_name="Cercococcyx olivinus">C. olivinus</taxonName> streaked.  <taxonName idx_name="Cercococcyx montanus">C. montanus</taxonName> has very heavy streaks on the throat, but the dark markings of the breast are more lunulate.</p>

				<p>SPECIMENS.&mdash;Avakubi, 3 &male;, Aug. 6, 21, Sept. 6; &female;, Sept. 27.  Babonde, &male;, July 20.</p>
				<p>ADULTS.&mdash;Iris rather dark brown, rim of eyelids, corners of mouth, and skin about nostril pale greenish or greenish yellow; maxilla blackish, mandible pale greenish or grayish green with dusky tip; feet bright yellow.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;Gold Coast to southern Cameroon, Ndala Tando in northern Angola, east to the southern Uelle, Semliki Valley, forest east of the Rutshuru Plain, and Katapena in the Lower Katanga.  A lowland bird, seldom found in places as high as the type locality, it has a range much like that of <taxonName idx_name="Cercococcyx mechowi">C. mechowi</taxonName>.  Even near the type locality of <taxonName idx_name="Cercococcyx olivinus">C. olivinus</taxonName> I have heard both these species calling.</p>
				<p><taxonName idx_name="Cercococcyx olivinus">C. olivinus</taxonName> prefers virgin forest, perching high in the trees, and is usually found only after prolonged search.  The male has two calls, a shorter one best compared with that of <taxonName>Cuculus solitarius</taxonName>, and a longer series of sounds like &quot;how.&quot;  The first kind is of three syllables, descending the scale, but the initial note is weak, so that often only the other two are heard.  It is repeated again and again: &quot;wh&ibreve;, whow, whow.&quot;  The other call is a protracted series of uniform notes like &quot;how,&quot; increasing in volume, and lasting ten or fifteen seconds.</p>
				<p>These calls are heard in the rainy part of the year, and then occasionally at night.  This must be the breeding season, for a female at Avakubi on September 27 had a pure white egg in its oviduct.</p>
				<p>In three stomachs we found only hairy caterpillars.</p>

In the Upper Katanga it must be rather rare, but I have seen specimens from near Tenke, Lukafu, and Kakyelo on the Luombwa River.</p>
				<p>According to Hartert,<note n="1">1921, Nov.

South African specimens have wings 118&ndash;125 mm.  The difficulty lies in the fact that intergradation is so gradual that we cannot draw any line between the alleged races. Congo specimens have wings 105&ndash;120 mm., so <taxonName idx_name="Chrysococcyx caprius chrysochlorus">chrysochlorus</taxonName>, if separable, would extend to the Congo.</p>
				<p>The didric cuckoo is the most readily observed of its genus, not a bird of heavy forest like <taxonName idx_name="Chrysococcyx caprius">C. cupreus</taxonName>, but found there rather in the clearings, two or three often flying about together.  In the savannas it is likewise common.  The male of <taxonName idx_name="Chrysococcyx caprius">caprius</taxonName> has a plaintive call of a half-dozen whistles, mounting the scale slightly.  The Medje people phrase it &quot;Pap&ubreve;nzisodu,&quot; meaning &quot;Father is dead, alas,&quot; and use this as the name of the bird.  I found it easily remembered by the words &quot;Oh dear, Dad did-id it.&quot;  The syllables are sometimes fewer.</p>
				<pb n="198" id="t000120-p00204c.tif"/>
				<p>Weaver birds in particular are parasitized by the didric, and we found its young in nests of <taxonName>Textor cucullatus</taxonName>, <taxonName>Melanopteryx nigerrimus</taxonName>, and <taxonName>Sitagra t&aelig;nioptera</taxonName>.  Near Landana Petit seems to have taken its eggs from nests of <taxonName>Textor collaris</taxonName>; and in East and South Africa they are sometimes deposited in nests of sunbirds, wagtails, sparrows, and other species. In the Congo savannas these cuckoos breed during the rains, like most of the weavers, and are relatively silent at other times of year.  Yet they seem non-migratory in our area.</p>
				<p>An egg which we took from the oviduct was pale greenish blue, with minute dusky spots.  The color is known to vary from greenish to white, usually with some spotting, even of brown.  Bannerman gives measurements as 21&ndash;24.8 mm. &times; 14.2&ndash;16.</p>
				<p>The young didric is surprisingly rufous, especially about its head, with bill and inside of mouth dull orange-red.  It is sometimes the only occupant of a nest, but we have found cases where one legitimate nestling survived.  The old weavers often pursue didrics which approach their nests.</p>
				<p>Of eighteen stomachs examined, none from nestlings, sixteen contained caterpillars, of which the minority were hairy.  A few chrysalids, beetles, and other insects were likewise present.</p>

				<p>SPECIMEN.&mdash;Banalia, &male;, Sept. 25.</p>
				<p>ADULT MALE.&mdash;Iris dull chrome-yellow, edge of eyelids light yellowish green; bill dull greenish yellow, base of maxilla blackish; feet dull yellowish green, claws black.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;Sierra Leone to Togo, from southern Cameroon eastward to the Uelle and Semliki Valley, and southward to the vicinity of Luebo, in the Kasai.</p>
				<p>It is mainly a bird of the tall trees in virgin forest, but ranges out into heavy gallery forests in the Uelle and Kasai districts.  In the Ituri forest it must be rather common, for its voice is not infrequently heard, usually a series of short sweet whistles, descending the scale slightly, and plainly audible for several hundred yards.  Only once I heard one give two loud, less musical notes, not unlike the call of <taxonName>Eurystomus gularis</taxonName>.</p>
				<pb n="199" id="t000120-p00205c.tif"/>
				<p>The cuckoo itself is hard to see, and it took us seven months of persistent search to shoot a specimen, though the calls were heard many times near Penge, Avakubi, Ngayu, and Panga.  I have since heard it near Beni.  Near the equator they probably call throughout the year.</p>
				<p>Our single specimen was obtained in a tree being devastated by caterpillars which it was eating, though its stomach contained some other insect-remains as well.</p>

				<p>ADULTS.&mdash;Iris dark brown (males), or light brownish gray (females), with blackish tip; feet dark green, claws black.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;From Cape Province to the Gambia, upper Nile districts, Abyssinia, and Asir in Arabia,<note n="1">See C. k. arabicus BATES, 1937, B. B. O. C., LVII, p. 150 (Asar, 4500 ft.).</note> in both savanna and forested regions.  It does not occur much above 6000 feet in the eastern Congo, but elsewhere is fairly common throughout our area.</p>
				<p>In heavy equatorial forest it is found mainly on the edge of clearings, keeping fairly high in the trees.  Gallery forests attract it in savanna districts, though it may also be found in large isolated trees.  Its call is a familiar whistled &quot;whee-hew,&quot; repeated monotonously by the male. This is heard mainly during the rainy months, or even at the end of the dry season, and marks the period of reproduction, which seems to extend over six or seven months.</p>
				<p>An egg taken from the oviduct at Niangara, May 4, was pale greenish blue, with scattered blotches of light rufous, especially near the larger end.  Lynes obtained an egg in Tanganyika Territory that was white, spotted with reddish.  Friedmann found the average measurements to be 23 &times; 14.3 mm.</p>
				<p>The fosterers of Klaas&apos;s cuckoo in the Congo are scarcely known. In eastern Africa they are reported to be <taxonName>Othyphantes reichenowi</taxonName>, <taxonName>Pycnonotus tricolor</taxonName>, <taxonName>Tchitrea viridis</taxonName>, <taxonName>Cinnyris venustus</taxonName>, and probably <taxonName>Emberiza cabanisi</taxonName>.  On one occasion in the Uelle I saw a female <taxonName idx_name="Chrysococcyx klaasi">C. klaasi</taxonName> being attacked savagely by a pair of blue fantail flycatchers (<taxonName>Erannornis longicauda</taxonName>).</p>
				<p>From twelve stomach examinations we learned that Klaas&apos;s cuckoo varies its fare of caterpillars, mostly hairless, with small numbers of hemiptera, beetles, and other similar insects.  One adult bird had even eaten a single small fruit.</p>

<pb n="202" id="t000120-p00208c.tif"/> <taxonName idx_name="Chrysococcyx cupreus">cupreus</taxonName> occurs in the northern Uelle.  Known to Europeans as &quot;Foliotocols,&quot; they occupy every district, except possibly the Upper Katanga and the open highlands of the Kivu.  They are much more common in the forest area than in savanna country, where they keep to the gallery forests.  The males attract attention, as they perch high in the trees, by their pleasant whistled call of three syllables, &quot;hew-tu-whee,&quot; repeated again and again.  Much more rarely they give a still more melodious, explosive series of notes which is not soon repeated.  In the dry season they are generally rather silent.</p>
				<p>The quiet, dull-colored females are less often seen, but the young<note n="1">Young of <taxonName idx_name="Chrysococcyx cupreus">C. cupreus</taxonName> are apt to be confused with those of <taxonName idx_name="Chrysococcyx klaasi">C. klaasi</taxonName>, but the barring of the fore-crown is much whiter in <taxonName idx_name="Chrysococcyx cupreus">cupreus</taxonName>, while <taxonName idx_name="Chrysococcyx klaasi">klaasi</taxonName> always has a white outer border on several lateral upper tail-coverts.</note> are frequently received from natives who find them in nests of other small birds, often fairly near the ground.  Near Medje I have found a young emerald cuckoo alone in the nest of <taxonName>Tchitrea viridis</taxonName>, and seen another being fed by <taxonName>Chalcomitra olivacea</taxonName>.  The breeding season lasts at least from May to September in that region, but the color of the eggs of the emerald cuckoo is not yet known with certainty.</p>
				<p>Like all the parasitic cuckoos, this species feeds mainly on caterpillars, which we found in nine out of eleven stomachs.  One adult male had eaten a small bird&apos;s egg, and one immature individual had swallowed hard-bodied insects and one seed.  Nestlings are sometimes given fruit by their fosterers.</p>

Specimens from the Ituri have wings 106&ndash;122 mm., those from Kinda and Dilolo in the Congo Museum, 124, 125, and 129 mm.</p>
				<p><taxonName>Ceuthmochares</taxonName> is not a coucal, but the African representative of an important Oriental subfamily.  <taxonName idx_name="Ceuthmochares &aelig;reus intermedius">C. &aelig;. intermedius</taxonName>, like typical <taxonName idx_name="Ceuthmochares &aelig;reus &aelig;reus">&aelig;reus</taxonName>, is a bird of the equatorial forest and gallery forests extending out from it.  In the great forest it is not seen in the virgin growth, but rather in dense secondary thickets near clearings and roads.  It scarcely invades the mountain forests.</p>
				<p>Often going in pairs, it has one call mid-way between a whistle and a whine, another being a prolonged clicking chatter, the first notes separate, but later running together more rapidly.  For a forest bird it has a short breeding season.  Just north of the equator this comes toward July.  This cuckoo builds its own nest.  An egg from the oviduct was pure white with chalky patches on it.  It was broken, but an egg of <taxonName idx_name="Ceuthmochares &aelig;reus flavirostris">C. &aelig;. flavirostris</taxonName> is known to measure 27 &times; 21.5 mm.</p>
				<p>The juvenal plumage is dull soot-color above, the breast dark gray with buffy feather-tips, remiges and rectrices not quite so glossy as in the adult.</p>
				<p>Fourteen stomach examinations showed orthoptera in nine, caterpillars in nine, beetles in six, hemiptera in three, two leaf-hoppers, and a slug.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;Zambesi region and Angola, north to Landana, savannas of the southern Congo, the Kivu Volcanoes, and the Kavirondo district.  Apparently rare in the Lower Congo, absent from the northern Kasai, and not very common in the higher parts of the Katanga.</p>
				<p>In haunts and habits the white-browed coucal differs little from <taxonName>Centropus monachus</taxonName>, except that it is more fond of high grass, and less apt to ascend mountains.  Its tooting is softer and lower than that of <taxonName idx_name="Centropus senegalensis">senegalensis</taxonName> and <taxonName idx_name="Centropus monachus">monachus</taxonName>, the notes running together more rapidly; and it also gives a hoarse, reiterated call faintly like a francolin&apos;s.</p>
				<p>A nest found by Dr. J. Bequaert near Bukama, April 25, was a large sphere of grass-blades with lateral opening, placed in a bush.  One young bird had not yet left.

				<p>ADULTS.&mdash;Iris scarlet (male) or orange-red (female); bill black; feet lead-gray.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;Senegal to Somaliland, and down the Nile to Egypt.  Southward it extends to Bechuanaland and the Transvaal, though absent from East Africa and most of the country from Lake Albert to Lake Tanganyika.</p>
				<p><taxonName idx_name="Centropus senegalensis senegalensis">C. s. senegalensis</taxonName> ranges from West Africa to Somaliland, northern Uganda, and the forest of the eastern Congo, south to northern Angola and possibly the Katanga.  It lives in savannas and forest clearings, but does not ascend mountains.  The other races are <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Centropus senegalensis &aelig;gyptius">&aelig;gyptius</taxonName> (Gmelin)</taxon>, of Nubia and Egypt, and <taxonName idx_name="Centropus senegalensis flecki">flecki</taxonName>, which extends from the Kalahari at least to southern Angola and Northern Rhodesia.</p>
				<p>In the Congo forest the Senegal coucal is found commonly in clearings, haunting scrubby thickets and elephant grass.  Out in the savannas it ranges more widely, but likes the denser growth, especially near swamps.</p>
				<p>Its tooting is one of the most familiar sounds, practically throughout the year.  The full performance is of fifteen to twenty notes, dropping at first in the scale, then rising a little before the end.  Sometimes two birds sing a duet, one beginning a little after the other.  At other times
<pb n="208" id="t000120-p00214c.tif"/> the toots are fewer, more slowly repeated, all in the same pitch.  Finally, they sometimes utter a very different harsh call.</p>
				<p>In the Uelle nesting takes place from September to November, when the grass is high enough to conceal the nests.  In the northern part of the forest belt breeding may begin a month earlier; and south of the equator the season must be reversed.</p>
				<p>The nest of this coucal is a large ball of coarse grass lined with leaves, opening laterally, placed in the forks of a low bush, well hidden.  Four or five eggs are laid, which are white, sometimes with a slight chalky coating.  Measurements given by Bannerman (1933) are 29.2&ndash;36 mm. &times; 22.6&ndash;25.6.</p>
				<p>In six stomachs we found nothing but insect remains: beetles in three cases, orthoptera in two, caterpillars in two, and one single hemipter.</p>

				<p>This race differs from <taxonName idx_name="Centropus senegalensis senegalensis">C. s. senegalensis</taxonName> in the lighter rufous color of its back and wings.

				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;Abyssinia, Sudan, and Gold Coast, south to northern Angola, Lualaba River, Marungu, and northern Tanganyika Territory.  There appear to be three races.  <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Centropus monachus monachus">C. m. monachus</taxonName> R&uuml;ppell</taxon> ranges from Eritrea and Abyssinia to central Kenya Colony, <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Centropus monachus fischeri">C. m. fischeri</taxonName> Reichenow</taxon> from the upper Nile Valley to the southeast shore of Lake Victoria, and <taxonName idx_name="Centropus monachus occidentalis">C. m. occidentalis</taxonName> from the northeastern Congo westward and southward.<note n="1">See Friedmann, 1930, Bull. 153, U. S. Nat. Mus., p. 278.  Grant and M.-Praed, 1937, B. B. O. C., LVII, pp. 116, 117, unite <taxonName idx_name="Centropus monachus occidentalis">occidentalis</taxonName> with <taxonName idx_name="Centropus monachus fischeri">fischeri</taxonName>.  <taxonName idx_name="Centropus cupreicaudus">C. cupreicaudus</taxonName> I regard as a distinct species.</note>  The typical race is the lightest in color, <taxonName idx_name="Centropus monachus occidentalis">occidentalis</taxonName> darker, but <taxonName idx_name="Centropus monachus fischeri">fischeri</taxonName> darkest of all, at least when immature.</p>
				<p>The western blue-headed coucal is found very commonly in the northern and eastern savannas of the Congo, even south to Marungu and the Lualaba River.  It scarcely enters the edge of the Upper Congo forest, is wanting in the Kasai district, but does occur in the Lower Congo, even in the clearings of the Mayombe forest.  On the slopes of Ruwenzori we found it in old clearings up to 7000 feet, but not in the real mountain forest.  On the Kivu Volcanoes it has been found up to 7800 feet.</p>
				<p><taxonName>Centropus monachus</taxonName> gives a descending series of &quot;toots,&quot; rising at the end, so similar to those of <taxonName idx_name="Centropus senegalensis">C. senegalensis</taxonName> that I could scarcely tell them apart.  The breeding season in the Uelle district extends from early May to November, thus covering the whole period of rains.  A nest found at Faradje on May 6, was an oval mass of dry sedges, lined with a few green leaves and with a lateral entrance.  It was effectively concealed amid the sedges and small bushes in a small marsh, only a foot above the soggy ground.  The soiled white eggs numbered three.  The
<pb n="210" id="t000120-p00216c.tif"/> male bird was snared as it came to the nest, thus strengthening the evidence that most of the incubation among coucals is performed by the males.  The dimensions of eggs of <taxonName idx_name="Centropus monachus occidentalis">C. m. occidentalis</taxonName>, according to Bannerman, are 35&ndash;37.5 mm. &times; 26&ndash;29.5.</p>
				<p><taxonName>Centropus monachus</taxonName> in juvenal dress is difficult to distinguish from <taxonName idx_name="Centropus senegalensis">senegalensis</taxonName>, but it has fine buffy shaft-streaks or spots on the crown, lacking in young <taxonName idx_name="Centropus senegalensis">senegalensis</taxonName>, and dark barring on the whole distal half of the primaries, not simply at their very tips.</p>
				<p>We examined only five stomachs of this coucal, finding grasshoppers and beetles in all.  But it is known to eat snails of the genus <taxonName>Limicolaria</taxonName>, as well as mice, nestlings, and eggs.  Lang was shown a small snake, supposedly killed by this coucal.</p>

				<p>SPECIMEN.&mdash;Isangi, &female; im., Dec. 10.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;From Bitye in southern Cameroon south to the Mayombe Forest and the vicinity of Leopoldville, and eastward at least
<pb n="211" id="t000120-p00217c.tif"/> to the Lomami River.  The Gaboon coucal replaces <taxonName idx_name="Centropus leucogaster">C. leucogaster</taxonName> in the southern half of the equatorial forest of the Congo, but no intergradation seems to take place between them.</p>
				<p>At Lukolela I found it to be rather common, calling like <taxonName idx_name="Centropus leucogaster">leucogaster</taxonName> early in the morning and toward evening from the thickest parts of the forest, especially where it was swampy.  Both sexes seem to call, the female having a deeper voice.  It is exceedingly difficult to see.</p>
				<p>The nest of this coucal is doubtless like that of <taxonName idx_name="Centropus leucogaster">C. leucogaster</taxonName>, and its breeding season at Lukolela began with the rains, for young were obtained in the latter half of November.</p>

				<p>ADULTS.&mdash;Iris red, bill and feet black.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;From the coast of French Guinea to the Semliki Valley, south to the Gaboon coast, but scarcely known from south of the equator.</p>
				<p><taxonName idx_name="Centropus leucogaster leucogaster">C. l. leucogaster</taxonName> Leach lives in the forests of Upper Guinea, <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Centropus leucogaster efulenensis">C. l. efulenensis</taxonName> Sharpe</taxon> in the coastal region of Cameroon and Gaboon, and <taxonName idx_name="Centropus leucogaster neumanni">C. l. neumanni</taxonName> in the northern half of the Upper Congo forest.  The last-named race is slightly smaller than <taxonName idx_name="Centropus leucogaster efulenensis">efulenensis</taxonName>, eight adult specimens from the Congo having wings 173&ndash;195 mm.  Bannerman (1933) gave wing-measurements of <taxonName idx_name="Centropus leucogaster efulenensis">efulenensis</taxonName> as 196 and 200 mm.</p>
				<p>The black-throated coucal is a forest-dweller, very rarely seen, skulking in the thickest second growth, but probably not fond of old virgin forest.  It ranges out into heavy gallery forests on the north.  Most specimens are obtained from natives and the majority are apt to be young that cannot fly well.</p>
				<p>Its tooting differs somewhat from that of <taxonName idx_name="Centropus senegalensis">C. senegalensis</taxonName>, being deeper-toned
<pb n="212" id="t000120-p00218c.tif"/> and less apt to rise in the scale toward the end.  Young birds often repeat a soft coo at intervals of ten or fifteen seconds.  The breeding season at the northern edge of the forest extends over most of the year, eggs being laid from March to December, at least.</p>
				<p>A nest brought to us near Niangara on December 14 was a large ball of dry leaves and a little grass, lined with green leaves, about a foot through.  It had been taken from a bush in the forest, and held two rounded, dirty white eggs, about to hatch.  The male bird was trapped at this nest.</p>
				<p>The young birds from these eggs had a dense growth of hairlike &quot;trichoptiles,&quot;<note n="1">See Shelford, 1917, `A Naturalist in Borneo,' p. 65.</note> white in color, over the whole upper surface.  These correspond to down enclosed in a persistent sheath, and are characteristic of all young coucals.  Their tongues also bore the large black U-shaped mark which seems always present in young of this genus.</p>
				<p>At Avakubi, in heavy second growth, I saw another nest with two eggs, but the birds were so shy that I could not even shoot one.  I regret that I did not measure the eggs.</p>
				<p>The eight stomachs examined all contained insects: beetles, hemiptera, grasshoppers, a mantis, and two caterpillars.  One bird had also eaten a frog, three spiders, and five snails, mostly Helixarions.</p>

				<p>SPECIMENS.&mdash;Medje, &female; im., July 13.  Niangara, &male; ad. in brown dress, &male; im., Apr. 20.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;Eastern Cape Province north to Witu, southern Abyssinia, the southern Sudan, Lake Chad, and Portuguese Guinea.  Except for rare occurrences in clearings near their margins, it avoids the lowland forests of Upper and Lower Guinea.</p>
				<p>The typical race is believed to occupy the greater part of the above range, <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Centropus grillii c&aelig;ruleiceps">C. g. c&aelig;ruleiceps</taxonName> Neumann</taxon> occurring in southern Abyssinia, and <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Centropus grillii wahlbergi">C. g. wahlbergi</taxonName> Grant</taxon> in Natal.  These forms differ supposedly in the color of the mantle and the reflections on the black head.</p>
				<p><taxonName idx_name="Centropus grillii grillii">C. g. grillii</taxonName>, at any rate, is widely distributed in the savannas of the Congo, but probably not above 5000 feet.  It spends much of its time low down in the grass, and thus escapes detection, though occasionally perching in bushes.  A wounded bird will run off and escape even in rather short grass.</p>
				<p>In the Uelle it is rather rare, but I found it more common at Kasenyi on Lake Albert.  Its notes were heard only in the Rutshuru Plain, a hollow, laughing &quot;cow,&quot; repeated eight or ten times, suggestive of <taxonName>Crinifer zonurus</taxonName>.</p>
				<p>This is the only African coucal with a special dull plumage worn in the off-season by adults.  The latter are black on head and underparts in the breeding season.  My brown adult from Niangara suggested this fact, and in 1930 W.W. Bowen showed me a female from Tanganyika Territory which I found to be undergoing a post-nuptial molt from black to brown.  Breeding certainly takes place during the rains, when the grass is high.</p>
				<p>Females are markedly larger than males, and have wings averaging 18&ndash;20 mm. longer.  The remarkable assymmetry of the testes in the genus <taxonName>Centropus</taxonName>, where the right one is regularly larger than the left, is very pronounced in the present species.  In one breeding male from Kasenyi the left testis seemed entirely absent.<note n="1">See also A.L. Rand, 1933, Auk, pp. 219, 220, for conditions in <taxonName>Centrpus toulou</taxonName>.</note>  Females, nevertheless, have only the usual left ovary and oviduct.  It seems probable that among African coucals the males do most or all of the incubation, though I still think that both sexes call.<note n="2">See Spennemann, 1928, Beitr. Fortpfl.-biol. V&ouml;g., IV, pp. 139&ndash;144, on the habits of <taxonName idx_name="Centropus javanensis">C. javanensis</taxonName>.</note>
				</p>
				<p>A nest of <taxonName idx_name="Centropus grillii grillii">grillii</taxonName> found by Darling in South Africa was artfully concealed
<pb n="214" id="t000120-p00220c.tif"/> in long grass in a vlei, woven out of living grass, invisible from a couple of yards.  Its top was domed, entrance at side, and the four white eggs inside were nearly spherical.<note n="1">W. L. Sclater, 1903, `Birds S. Afr.,' III, p. 209.</note>
				</p>
				<p>In five stomachs I found beetles, grasshoppers, two mantises, a few hemiptera, a cricket, an ant, a caterpillar, and a spider.</p>

				<p>SPECIMENS.&mdash;Boma, 2 &male;, Jan. 3, 17; &female;, Jan. 17.</p>
				<p>ADULT MALE.&mdash;Iris rather dark brown, edges of the eyelids with their papill&aelig; scarlet; bill dull dark red, blackish at very tip; feet black.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;From the Gambia to the bend of the Ubangi River, and south through the Lower Congo to northern Angola. <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Turacus persa buffoni">T. p. buffoni</taxonName> (Vieillot)</taxon>, from west of Liberia, has a broad black line below the eye, and little or no white below the black.  <taxonName idx_name="Turacus persa zenkeri">T. p. zenkeri</taxonName>, in the Cameroon and vicinity, has a narrow black line below eye, and a narrower white stripe underneath.  <taxonName idx_name="Turacus persa persa">T. p. persa</taxonName>, from the Ivory Coast to Mt. Cameroon, reappearing from the Gaboon to northern Angola, has a well-developed white stripe beneath the narrow black line.</p>
				<p>This is the common <taxonName>Turacus</taxonName> of the Lower Congo, often seen in pairs in the Mayombe forest and in the woods along watercourses near Boma. Its calls are very similar to those of <taxonName idx_name="Turacus sch&uuml;ttii">T. sch&uuml;ttii</taxonName>, a reiterated, resonant &quot;k-k-kaw,&quot; and a single hoarse &quot;haw&mdash;&quot; slightly prolonged.  Among the fruits I found in two stomachs were nine wild dates (from <taxonName>Ph&oelig;nix reclinata</taxonName>).</p>
				<p>Since the story was first told by Jules Verreaux, it has often been repeated that the crimson pigment of turaco wings, turacin,<note n="1">See Church, 1913, P. Z. S.

I have never shot a turaco with faded wings, even in the wettest forests; and a feather of <taxonName idx_name="Turacus persa">T. persa</taxonName>, worn for a year and a half in my hat in the United States, instead of bleaching became actually darker red on the exposed end.  The same thing happens with old mounted specimens in museums.</p>

				<p>DITRIBUTION.&mdash;From the Sanaga River, Cameroon, to Spanish Guinea and the Ogow&eacute; River, eastward to the Ubangi River.  This race must occur in the northwest corner of the Belgian Congo, for in the Paris Museum there is a female collected by Dybowski at Bangui, showing the very narrow white line of <taxonName idx_name="Turacus persa zenkeri">zenkeri</taxonName>.  A male from Beso, between Bangui
<pb n="217" id="t000120-p00223c.tif"/> and Krebedje, collected by Decorse, is apparently of the same race. Specimens from the Gaboon are variable.</p>
				<p>According to Bates, the nest of Zenker&apos;s turaco is a frail structure of dry twigs, placed in low forest trees, and containing two eggs.  They are plain creamy white, often nearly spherical, measuring 34.5&ndash;37 mm. &times; 32&ndash;34.5.  Both sexes incubate.</p>

				<p>SPECIMEN.&mdash;Stanleyville, &male; juv., Aug. 21.  (A nestling with violet scapulars and rectrices already visible.)</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;From northern Angola and the mouth of the Kasai River eastward to Uganda, the southeast side of Lake Kivu, and the forest northwest of Lake Tanganyika.</p>
				<p>The whole western and central parts of this range are occupied by <taxonName idx_name="Turacus sch&uuml;ttii sch&uuml;ttii">T. s. sch&uuml;ttii</taxonName>, with rather dull violet back, and the eastern part by <taxonName idx_name="Turacus sch&uuml;ttii emini">T. s. emini</taxonName>, with glossy green back.  Intergradation takes place in a relatively narrow band running from the vicinity of Semio and Doruma, on the northern Congo border, southward to Banalia and the vicinity of Kasongo. The intermediate specimens have been grouped in two races, <taxonName idx_name="Turacus sch&uuml;ttii sharpei">sharpei</taxonName> with glossy blue back and tail, and <taxonName idx_name="Turacus sch&uuml;ttii finschi">finschi</taxonName> with these parts glossy blue-green.  If both are recognized, their ranges are difficult to define.</p>
				<p>Throughout its range in the Congo forest Sch&uuml;tt&apos;s turaco is a common bird, with the same habits and voice as <taxonName idx_name="Turacus sch&uuml;ttii emini">emini</taxonName>.  At Lukolela a female about to lay was collected on September 2, and a nest was found under construction in some dense second growth in early December, but it was never completed.  So breeding takes place in the first half of the rains, and probably continues through the better part of the year.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;This can only be stated by referring to the localities listed in the synonymy.  The whole area of intergradation cannot be much more than 150 miles wide.  In the western part of this long band across the equatorial forest, approximately between 25&Degree; and 27&Degree; east longitude&mdash;north of the equator&mdash;the bluer individuals have been collected which are called <taxonName idx_name="Turacus sch&uuml;ttii sharpei">sharpei</taxonName>.

				<p>ADULTS.&mdash;Iris brown, papill&aelig; on eyelids vermilion; bill brownish black, becoming reddish at base of mandible; feet blackish.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;Forests of the eastern Congo, from Niangara and Faradje south to the northwest side of Lake Tanganyika, thence eastward across Uganda to the Yala River, to the forest east of the Rutshuru Plain, and the Rugege forest in the Kivu highlands.  It ascends to 9000 feet on Ruwenzori, and I have heard it at 7800 feet on Mt. Niragongo. Our specimens from Niangara, Medje, and Batama (only 90 miles eastward of Stanleyville) are definitely <taxonName idx_name="Turacus sch&uuml;ttii emini">emini</taxonName>, though taken near the western limit of this race.</p>
				<p>Although <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Turacus sch&uuml;ttii ugand&aelig;">T. s. ugand&aelig;</taxonName> Reichenow</taxon><note n="1">1907, O. Mb., p. 4 (Uganda).</note> is not usually recognized, it is a fact that specimens from the eastern Congo border often have more brassy reflections than those taken in the western part of the range of <taxonName idx_name="Turacus sch&uuml;ttii emini">emini</taxonName>.</p>
				<p>Emin&apos;s turaco is the only member of its genus in the interior of the eastern Congo forest and in the mountain forests from Lake Albert to the
<pb n="220" id="t000120-p00226c.tif"/> northern end of Lake Tanganyika.  It goes in small numbers, two or three together, keeping to the heavy foliage, where the red of the wings shows but a moment as they fly for cover.  As a rule their voice makes their presence known: a reiterated, resonant &quot;khaw, khaw, khaw,&mdash;&quot; lasting perhaps fifteen seconds.  This is a most characteristic noise of the forest during almost the entire year.  Two other calls, less often heard, are a long hoarse grunt and a rapid series of sharp notes like &quot;quick! quick! quick!&mdash;&quot;</p>

				<p>Two birds together often go through an amusing, bowing performance with raised tail and drooping wings.  Along boughs they run with the agility of squirrels, and in captivity one can see that the fourth, or outer toe of <taxonName>Turacus</taxonName> is turned backward while perching.  After death it points forward.</p>
				<p>Dissections showed that in the Ituri breeding probably goes on throughout the year, except perhaps in the three driest months.  In the region of Medje we were shown nests on August 24 and September 28, frail structures of twigs, about twelve feet up, in tangled second growth.  The first, close to a native hut, contained two white eggs, 36.4 &times; 29.7 mm. and 37.5 &times; 29.6.  The male bird was incubating.  In the second there was a single nestling, still clothed in sooty brown down.</p>
				<p>Of eleven stomachs examined, ten contained fruit, the other some green vegetable matter.  The fruit of the parasol tree (<taxonName>Musanga</taxonName>) is most commonly eaten, and one bird had added seventeen small snails to its meal of fruit.</p>

				<p>ADULTS.&mdash;Iris dark brown, eyelids red (but without papill&aelig;); bill yellow, with base of maxilla greenish yellow above, and base of mandible whitish or greenish; feet black.</p>
				<pb n="223" id="t000120-p00229c.tif"/>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;Eastern Benue Province of Nigeria and savannas of Cameroon to the southern Bahr-el-Ghazal, Uelle district, northern Uganda, and the Elgon district.</p>
				<p>The white-crested turaco is partial to strips of forest along streams, usually found in parties of about a half-dozen, and often ventures out into the smaller trees of the savannas.  Thus it is easily observed. The usual call is a succession of low, hoarse sounds, a grunting &quot;cow-cow-cow&mdash;&quot; introduced by a note somewhat longer and higher than those which follow.</p>

				</p>
				<p>Nesting goes on through the greater part of the rainy period, but is interrupted in the drought.  Near Faradje a nest was shown me as early as April 22.  It was in the savanna, between the forking branches of an acacia-like tree only 20 feet tall, built of dry twigs, and only slightly concave.  The two dull white eggs, of rounded form, measured 35 &times; 32.2 mm. and 35.5 &times; 32.3.  Both sexes seem to incubate.</p>
				<p>Of seven stomachs examined, one held a fair-sized snail, and the others berries and other fruits.  One bird had also eaten a small flower-head.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;Angola, from Benguella to the upper Kwango River, Ndala Tando, and the south bank of the lower Congo River. The Gaboon record is doubtless erroneous, but the red-crested turaco is to be expected in the Lower Congo.  It may occur also in the south-western Kwango district of the Belgian Colony.</p>
				<p>There are two adult specimens in the Congo Museum which were taken by P. Janssens between San Antonio and Ganga-Ginga, just south of the lower Congo River.  Apparently this turaco prefers savanna woods to heavy forests, and it is not likely to inhabit the Mayombe forest.</p>

				<p>ADULTS.&mdash;Iris dark brown, eyelids with a single row of raised &quot;beads&quot; all around, of dark scarlet like the smooth skin below and behind the eye, remainder of orbital and loral skin bright yellow.  Tip of bill blackish, sharply limited, remainder dull pale green, finely stippled toward base with purplish red, and often becoming purplish red on base of culmen, base of mandible, and adjacent corner of maxilla. Feet dusky brown to blackish.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;Mountains of the eastern Congo border, from Ruwenzori and the northwest side of Lake Edward to the northwest side of Lake Tanganyika.  <taxonName idx_name="Ruwenzorornis johnstoni johnstoni">R. j. johnstoni</taxonName> is not restricted to Ruwenzori, for I have collected specimens at Mulu, 8100 feet, northwest of Lake Edward, and expect this race to occur on Mt. Tshabirimu.  It has bare orbital skin, whereas <taxonName idx_name="Ruwenzorornis johnstoni kivuensis">R. j. kivuensis</taxonName>, the southern race, has only the eyelids bare.</p>
				<p>The Ruwenzori turaco has not been found in the mountains west of Lake Albert, but on Ruwenzori it is a common and conspicuous bird, mainly above 7000 feet, and extending up to nearly 12,000 feet on the western side.  It seemed most numerous toward 8950 feet, just below the tree-heath zone.</p>
				<pb n="226" id="t000120-p00232c.tif"/>
				<p>Like ordinary turacos in most of their habits, these birds nevertheless have several calls that are unusual.  Single loud chirps of unusual resonance are often given, or a series of similar, ringing chirps, beginning slowly then running ever more rapidly to a diminishing close.  Still another characteristic call is a cackle that suggests a monkey voice, a resounding &quot;ch-k-k-k-krowng!&quot; descending in pitch, nasal at the end. Lastly, there is a single &quot;caw&quot; like that of <taxonName>Turacus sch&uuml;ttii</taxonName>.</p>
				<p>At times the woods re-echoed with these calls, and three or four birds were feeding in a tree together.  Most of those collected had been eating a small drupe, of pale mauve color, from the <taxonName>Rapanea</taxonName><note n="1">In `Birds of the Belgian Congo,' Part I, 1932, pp. 170, 175, I mistakenly used the name <taxonName>Agauria</taxonName> for these trees.</note> trees.  They also

					</figure>  ate a smaller greenish-white berry, and are said to take the fruit of the African yew (<taxonName>Podocarpus</taxonName>).</p>
				<p>In December, one of the dry periods on west Ruwenzori, the breeding season of <taxonName>Ruwenzorornis</taxonName> seemed to be approaching and no young birds were about.  At Mulu in early March there were immature birds with remnants of juvenal plumage, and three adults were in non-breeding condition.  These facts point to a rather definite reproductive period, several months earlier at Mulu than on Ruwenzori.  It may be predicted that the nest of <taxonName>Ruwenzorornis</taxonName> is very like that of <taxonName>Turacus</taxonName>.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;Mountain forests of the Kivu region, from north-west of Lake Tanganyika and Rugege north to the volcanoes, and highlands west of Lake Kivu.  This race has the orbit almost completely covered with metallic green feathers, only the &quot;beaded&quot; rim of eyelids deep scarlet.  Bill colored as in <taxonName idx_name="Ruwenzorornis johnstoni johnstoni">R. j. johnstoni</taxonName>.</p>
				<p>The Kivu turaco is common on the well-wooded central volcanoes, usually from 8000 up to 12,000 feet, but at times coming down in numbers to 6500 feet.  It is not dependent on bamboos, which furnish no food for it, and here too is fond of <taxonName>Rapanea</taxonName> fruit.  One was found to have eaten a snail.  On Mt. Kandashomwa, west of the Ruzizi Valley, this turaco lives between 7500 and 8800 feet; but along the escarpment east of the volcanoes in British Ruanda I failed to hear it.  The voice is very similar to that of the Ruwenzori race.</p>
				<p>On Mikeno and Karisimbi two breeding females were taken in June, also three young birds four to six months old.  There may be a long breeding season starting in June, or there may be two periods of reproduction.</p>

				<p>ADULTS.&mdash;Iris dark brown, orbit yellow.  Maxilla yellow, with a little brownish red beneath nostril; on the frontal shield the yellow shades posteriorly into red; mandible brownish red with yellowish tip.  Feet black.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;Border regions about the Lower Guinea forest: Northeastern Cameroon to Mount Elgon, Nandi district, both shores of Lake Victoria, Katanga, Northern Rhodesia, and Angola.  It ranges in to the edges of the heavy forest, but never penetrates
<pb n="229" id="t000120-p00235c.tif"/> far.  In the Cameroon lives <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Musophaga ross&aelig; savannicola">M. r. savannicola</taxonName> Grote</taxon>, differing from <taxonName idx_name="Musophaga ross&aelig; ross&aelig;">M. r. ross&aelig;</taxonName> only by its lighter red crest.  This race may possibly extend to the Ubangi River.  <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Musophaga violacea">M. violacea</taxonName> Isert</taxon>, of Upper Guinea, is a distinct species.</p>
				<p>Lady Ross&apos;s plantain-eater is entirely a bird of forest patches and borders, unknown even at Medje or Lukolela, so close to the edge of the Congo forest.  It cannot escape detection, on account of its loud voice.  Furthermore, it is a lowland bird, ascending little above 5000 feet.  Though found at Djugu, west of Lake Albert and about Lake Kivu, it does not ascend the slopes of Ruwenzori or the Kivu Volcanoes.</p>

				<p>More sociable than <taxonName>Turacus</taxonName>, these birds go in parties that may number ten or a dozen.  They are shy and often difficult to collect. The notes so commonly heard are rather like the longer calls of <taxonName>Turacus</taxonName>, but the rhythm is less regular, and two or more birds seem to be calling at once.  There is a slight suggestion of the rolling quality of <taxonName>Coryth&aelig;ola</taxonName>.</p>
				<p>In the Uelle district their calling was most persistent in June and July, though heard till early December.  A bird in breeding condition was taken in the latter half of March, and nesting presumably continues on through the rains.  Nests known from Uganda were platforms of twigs, with two white eggs, 42 &times; 40 mm.</p>
				<p>In six stomachs we found only fruit, once at least that of the parasol tree (<taxonName>Musanga</taxonName>).</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;Zululand and Mafeking north to the Rufiji River, Tanganyika Territory, Marungu, Upper Katanga, and the mouth of the Congo River.

				<p>The goaway bird is found in the Congo only in Marungu, the Upper Katanga, along the coast near Banana, and supposedly at Kisantu.

It frequents trees in the savannas, especially, according to Neave<note n="2">1910, Ibis, p. 116.</note> in low-lying river valleys.  The well-known name of this gray turaco is derived from its call, which B&ouml;hm wrote &quot;k - o - &ebreve;&ebreve;h.&quot;</p>
				<p>Nests are built in southern Africa from October to January, so it may be expected to nest in the Katanga during the rains.  Three eggs are laid, bluish white or pale ivory-green, measuring about 39 &times; 32.5 mm.</p>

				<p>This Angolan race is the one to be expected near the Congo mouth. Dr. Schouteden is positive of the specific" identification of the bird he saw at Moanda, though he did not secure a specimen.  The occurrence of a goaway bird at Kisantu, as reported by Dubois, seems questionable, for no other example has ever been seen away from the coast in the Lower Congo.  I have been unable to find the Kisantu specimen.</p>

				<p>ADULTS.&mdash;Iris brown, bill light yellowish green, with a little orange at very base of maxilla; feet black.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;Bogosland and Abyssinia west to the Bahr-el-Ghazal and Fort Archambault on the Shari River; south through Uganda to Urundi and west again to the Lualaba River.  Known in the Congo only from the Uelle, the upper Semliki, Rutshuru, and Ruzizi valleys, Ruanda, Urundi, and the vicinity of Kongolo.</p>
				<p>This gray plantain-eater is a bird of savannas, common in the vicinity of Faradje.  It prefers places where a few large trees fringe some watercourse, and goes in small numbers, from two to five.  High-pitched laughter is the sound suggested by its voice.  The notes may be introduced by a loud &quot;kwah,&quot; after which follow several syllables like &quot;how-how-how.&quot;  As these continue the tone changes, and the whole is apt to end in a peculiar falsetto.  The single &quot;kwah&quot; may be uttered alone, or in flight a low vocal &quot;ka&quot; may accompany each wing-beat.
<pb n="232" id="t000120-p00238c.tif"/> A newcomer to a tree-top often performs a graceful dive before alighting near a companion.</p>
				<p>While the birds seem noisy the year round, they nest largely in the dry season, from late November until March in the Uelle.  A nest found

				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;Hawash district of southern Abyssinia, east to Harrar, and south to Lake Zwai: <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Gymnoschizorhis personata personata">G. p. personata</taxonName> (R&uuml;ppell)</taxon>.  Also in eastern Africa, from the Masai Country of Tanganyika Territory to the Kavirondo Gulf, the base of Ruwenzori, Lake Kivu, and the northern end of Lake Nyasa.

The East African race differs from the Abyssinian in having no green on the under surface of the rectrices, the lower breast wholly vinaceous buff, a smaller green patch on the white chest, and darker gray crest.</p>
				<p>Within our limits the bare-faced turaco has been collected only in Ruanda and Urundi, but it is to be expected along the northern shore of Lake Edward and perhaps near Lake Moero.  The Congo Museum has three specimens from Ruanda, two of them from Gabiro.  In habits it resembles <taxonName>Crinifer zonurus</taxonName>, haunting trees near watercourses or in dry stream beds, in pairs or small parties.  It utters a single loud, hoarse &quot;caw,&quot; or similar notes repeated a few times.  Since it favors areas of light rainfall it is local in the eastern Congo.</p>
				<p>Nests found by B&ouml;hm in East Africa in tree-tops were built of twigs, sometimes with rootlets and dry grass.  The eggs were white, faintly yellowish by transmitted light, measuring about 42.4 &times; 32.3 mm. The usual set was three.</p>

				<p>ADULTS.&mdash;Iris dark red, skin around eye blackish.  Basal half of bill bright yellow, tip orange-red, the two colors meeting abruptly; feet black.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;From the Casamance River eastward through Upper and Lower Guinea, including Fernando Po, to Mount Elgon, the Kavirondo district, and forests east of Lake Kivu.  It is seldom found above 5500 feet.  On the north it reaches the Mbomu River and a forest between Faradje and Aba, where I have heard it.  On the south it extends to the forest patches of northern Angola, the Kasai and the Manyema.</p>
				<p>There is some variation in color and size, birds from the center of the forest belt being perhaps more deeply colored than those from the periphery of the range.  Yet <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Coryth&aelig;ola cristata yalensis">C. c. yalensis</taxonName> Mearns</taxon>, from the western boundary of Kenya Colony, has not been generally recognized, and the changes seem too gradual for exact delimitation of races.</p>
				<p>Commonly called the &quot;peacock&quot; in West Africa, and &quot;faisan bleu&quot; in the Congo, the giant plantain-eater is also well known as the &quot;bulikoko&quot; all across the Belgian Congo.  Everywhere in the forest area and in regions with heavy gallery forests it is one of the most conspicuous birds.  Five or six generally go together, keeping to the higher trees, hopping from branch to branch or running along the larger limbs.
<pb n="236" id="t000120-p00242c.tif"/> When flying from one tree to the next they proceed in leisurely succession, two to six flaps of the wings being followed by a short sail on outspread pinions.  The crest is lowered in flight.</p>
				<p>The common calls of this noisy bird are a rapidly reiterated &quot;cow-cow-cow-cow- &mdash;&quot; and a rolling &quot;coo-o-o-o-o - &mdash;.&quot;  Both can be heard at half a mile.  Another frequently heard is a slower &quot;kul&uacute;k, kul&uacute;k, kul&uacute;k, &mdash;.&quot;  Most of its native names are based on these notes.</p>

				<p>In the forests of the Ituri and southern Uelle some individuals seem to be breeding at every season, while others are in non-breeding condition.  Nestlings were brought to us by natives in wet and in dry months.  Their down is mainly sooty blackish, blackest on the head, more brownish on the breast.  In all young turacos the outermost primaries grow slowly, so the wing-tip is strikingly rounded.  In <taxonName>Coryth&aelig;ola</taxonName> the brood is invariably of two.</p>
				<p>The two nests I saw myself, near Medje and Avakubi, were in large trees near openings in the forest, and about thirty-five yards from the ground.  Near one of them a pair of weavers (<taxonName>Malimbus erythrogaster</taxonName>)
<pb n="237" id="t000120-p00243u.tif"/> was building a nest.  Nests of <taxonName>Coryth&aelig;ola</taxonName> brought by natives were made of dry sticks freshly broken at the ends, some of them nearly three feet long and much branched.  An egg which I took from the oviduct was light blue-green, 46.9 &times; 39.3 mm.</p>
				<p>The principal food of the giant plantain-eater is apparently the fruit of the parasol tree (<taxonName>Musanga</taxonName>), which we found in seven out of ten stomachs.  Other fruits of course are often eaten, and three birds had swallowed tender young leaves, a fourth some soft green shoots bearing flower-buds.</p>

				<p>This long-tailed parrakeet, divisible in about four races, extends from Senegal and Portuguese Guinea across Northern Nigeria and the Sudan to northern Abyssinia, Eritrea, and India south to Ceylon. The typical race ranges from Senegal eastward to the White Nile, keeping always a little north of the edge of the forest belt, so that it is not yet known within the borders of the Congo.  Emin obtained it, however, at Wandi, only thirty-five miles from the boundary of the Upper Uelle district; and I have seen another specimen procured by Schubotz at Redjaf; so the species deserves mention here as wandering possibly, if very rarely, to within our territory.</p>

				<p>ADULTS.&mdash;Iris yellow; bill dark bluish gray, lighter beneath mandible; feet gray.  A wounded male was observed to have decidedly reddish-orange eyes, though after death they quickly turned yellow.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;Forests of Liberia, to which <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Agapornis swinderniana swinderniana">A. s. swinderniana</taxonName> (Kuhl)</taxon> is restricted; and from western Cameroon to the Bomokandi River, the Ituri district, Semliki Valley, and Manyema. The latter area is occupied by <taxonName idx_name="Agapornis swinderniana zenkeri">A. s. zenkeri</taxonName>.  The southern limits of its range doubtless follow the edge of the forest belt, for it has been taken in the vicinity of Bolobo; but it is still doubtful whether <taxonName idx_name="Agapornis swinderniana zenkeri">zenkeri</taxonName> occurs in the Mayombe or the Kasai.  Neumann&apos;s <taxonName idx_name="Agapornis swinderniana emini">emini</taxonName> is a synonym.</p>
				<p>Zenker&apos;s love-bird is an arboreal bird of the heavy forest, and while it also occurs in some of the larger gallery forests, it seldom comes down near the ground.  Very exceptionally it visits the small bark-cloth fig trees near villages to feed on their fruit; but most of the wild figs of which it is so fond are obtained from the strangling figs that grow upon large trees, often at the edges of clearings.  Ten to fifteen of them may come there together, sharing the feast with barbets and bulbuls.</p>
				<p>Their flight and their twittering notes when they passed overhead reminded me of <taxonName idx_name="Agapornis swinderniana crossbills">crossbills</taxonName>; and they were" identified readily in places where I was unable to collect specimens, as at Lukolela.  We never saw <taxonName idx_name="Agapornis swinderniana zenkeri">zenkeri</taxonName> and <taxonName idx_name="Agapornis swinderniana pullaria">pullaria</taxonName> in the same tree, their feeding habits are so different; and their ranges overlap only along the borderland of the forest, as at Medje.</p>
				<p>The nest of this love-bird is unknown, but in the vicinity of Medje its breeding season seems to be about July.  Most of the specimens collected are found to be non-breeding.</p>
				<p>In the crops and stomachs of eight examples we found seeds from wild figs seven times, while pieces of small dark-colored insects, one caterpillar, and a half-dozen soft white insect larv&aelig;, apparently of beetles, were noted in three or four cases.</p>

				<p>ADULTS.&mdash;Iris dark brown, eyelids dusky; maxilla dull orange, with whitish tip, mandible whitish; feet light gray.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;Western Africa from Fouta Djalon and Sierra Leone to northern Angola, also on Fernando Po, Princes Island, and S&atilde;o Tom&eacute;.  Eastward it extends north of the forest belt to the Bahr-el-Ghazal and Uganda, thence to southern Abyssinia.  To the south of the forest it is found from the Loango Coast to Stanley Pool, but not in the Kasai.</p>
				<p>There are only two races, <taxonName idx_name="Agapornis pullaria pullaria">pullaria</taxonName> occupying the greater part of the above area, and <taxonName idx_name="Agapornis pullaria ugand&aelig;">ugand&aelig;</taxonName> the region from the Omo River to Lake Victoria and Lake Edward.  The rump of the latter race is distinctly paler blue.  In the eastern Congo typical <taxonName idx_name="Agapornis pullaria pullaria">pullaria</taxonName> is found north of the Semliki forest,<note n="1">My specimens from Irumu are certainly <taxonName idx_name="Agapornis pullaria pullaria">pullaria</taxonName>, though the three collected at Mahagi Port by Dr. Schouteden are more difficult to determine, and possibly intermediate.</note> <taxonName idx_name="Agapornis pullaria ugand&aelig;">ugand&aelig;</taxonName> to the south of it.  Around the borders of the great forest the red-faced love-bird penetrates a little way into the clearings where tall grasses are found, but it is unknown in the whole central area.</p>
				<p>Even in the wild state these love-birds are often seen huddled together in pairs as they perch on some dry branch.  Their food consists
<pb n="241" id="t000120-p00247c.tif"/> mainly of the seeds of tall grasses, along the stalks of which they climb. &quot;Durra&quot; or guinea-corn (<taxonName>Sorghum</taxonName>) is eaten while green, and I have known them to attack guavas.  No insect-remains were found in their stomachs, but occasionally tiny pebbles.  On taking wing they fly rapidly, with a continuous chirruping note, much weaker than that of <taxonName idx_name="Agapornis swinderniana">A. swinderniana</taxonName>.  Seven or eight was the largest number I ever noted in a single flock.</p>
				<p>In the Uelle district the breeding season is evidently during the rains, from May to October.  Five young of a single brood were brought to us in October at Faradje, taken, it was said, from a hole in a large termite hill on the ground.  In West Africa nests have been found by Bates and others in earthy nests of termites or ants, high up in trees. In captivity nesting material is carried by tucking it between the feathers of the rump.  The eggs are white, measuring 20 &times; 16 mm.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;From Eritrea to French Equatorial Africa, southern Bahr-el-Ghazal, and through eastern Africa to Portuguese East Africa, the Transvaal, Ovampoland, and Angola.  Eight races are recognized, of which four or five may reach the Congo.</p>
				<p><taxonName idx_name="Poicephalus meyeri meyeri">P. m. meyeri</taxonName> is a relatively light-colored race, with green rump distinctly washed with blue.  The crown is often traversed by a yellow band, especially in females.  Wing-length 142&ndash;154 mm.  This form ranges from Eritrea and the Sudan almost to the northern border of the Uelle district and to the vicinity of Lado.  <taxonName idx_name="Poicephalus meyeri adolfi-friderici">P. m. adolfi-friderici</taxonName>, of the Ubangi-Shari territory, is supposedly darker, with underparts grassgreen. <taxonName idx_name="Poicephalus meyeri saturatus">P. m. saturatus</taxonName>, of Uganda and adjacent countries, also differs from the typical race in being somewhat darker, the green rump only faintly tinged with bluish.  Wings 140&ndash;159 mm.  <taxonName idx_name="Poicephalus meyeri neavei">P. m. neavei</taxonName>, from the southeastern Congo to Angoniland, is very dark, the underparts often more washed with blue, and the rump bluish rather than green.  Wings 148&ndash;165.  <taxonName idx_name="Poicephalus meyeri reichenowi">P. m. reichenowi</taxonName> of Angola is more strongly washed with blue below, and light blue on the rump.  It usually lacks yellow on the forehead, and has wings 152&ndash;167 mm.</p>
				<p>The remaining subspecies are <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Poicephalus meyeri matschiei">P. m. matschiei</taxonName> Neumann</taxon> of Tanganyika Territory and adjacent countries, <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Poicephalus meyeri transvaalensis">P. m. transvaalensis</taxonName> Neumann</taxon> of eastern South Africa, and <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Poicephalus meyeri damarensis">P. m. damarensis</taxonName> Neumann</taxon> of Southwest Africa.</p>
				<p>Although Piaggia was supposed to have collected <taxonName idx_name="Poicephalus meyeri meyeri">P. m. meyeri</taxonName> close to the northern boundary of the Uelle district, I have been unable to find a single specimen from that part of our territory.  The flock seen by Schouteden at Mahagi Port may perhaps have belonged to this race, if they were not <taxonName idx_name="Poicephalus meyeri saturatus">saturatus</taxonName>.  In the district about Lado, Emin Pascha<note n="1">Schubotz, 1921, `Tageb. Emin Pascha,' VI, p. 85.</note> found <taxonName idx_name="Poicephalus meyeri meyeri">meyeri</taxonName> rather common in the wooded savanna, forming parties which split up during the breeding season, toward the beginning of the rains.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;From the interior of Kenya Colony across Uganda to Unyoro, the base of Ruwenzori, Kagera and Ruzizi valleys, the eastern shore of Lake Tanganyika, and the grasslands southwest of Baraka. Woosnam noted that it was plentiful in the acacia country at the southern end of the Ruwenzori range and in the upper Semliki Valley; but it does not ascend the mountains, and it avoids the lowland forests. There seem to be no reliable records from the Rutshuru Plain or the shores of Lake Kivu.</p>
				<p>Pairs or parties of four to six are the rule, and they are very noisy. This parrot is a shy bird, of straight and swift flight, very apt to dart out of the far side of a tree in its escape.  Besides feeding on wild fruit in the trees, it raids native grain-fields.  Its rounded white eggs are laid in holes in trees, presumably two or three to a set.  One collected by B&ouml;hm measured 27 &times; 24 mm.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;From the southwest shore of Lake Tanganyika and the Katanga through Northern Rhodesia to the southwest side of Lake Nyasa.  According to Grote (1926) the range of <taxonName idx_name="Poicephalus meyeri neavei">neavei</taxonName> extended to Lake Kivu and the Kagera River; but a large series of specimens in the Congo
<pb n="245" id="t000120-p00251c.tif"/> Museum shows that birds from the savannas of the eastern Manyema district are better referred to <taxonName idx_name="Poicephalus meyeri saturatus">saturatus</taxonName>.  Others from Tembwe on Lake Tanganyika and Kabalo on the Lualaba River are perhaps intermediate, but approach <taxonName idx_name="Poicephalus meyeri neavei">neavei</taxonName> in the very dark brown of their upperparts, though having more yellow on the crown than is usual in birds from the Upper Katanga.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;From Benguella to northern Angola and possibly to the Kwango district of the Congo, or the lower Congo River.  It has been a common supposition that this parrot would occur in the southern parts of the Belgian Congo, but it has not been found in the Kasai district. Future collecting may show that it does reach the Kwango.  Sir Harry Johnston<note n="1">1884 `River Congo,' pp. 38, 362, 367.</note> reported seeing parrots at Kissang&eacute;, on the left bank of the lower Congo below Boma, which were &quot;grey and blue and yellow-shouldered.&quot;  The name <taxonName idx_name="Poicephalus r&uuml;ppellii">P. r&uuml;ppellii</taxonName> appears in his list of Congo birds; but I cannot help thinking that these remarks were prompted by birds he had previously seen in Angola, and I doubt the occurrence of <taxonName idx_name="Poicephalus meyeri reichenowi">P. m. reichenowi</taxonName> on the lower Congo.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;From the Bahr-el-Ghazal province and the northern end of the Uelle district west to northern Cameroon.  Often regarded as the young of some form of <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Poicephalus flavifrons">P. flavifrons</taxonName> (R&uuml;ppell)</taxon>, this rare parrot has proved to be a distinct species.  Its general color is green, brightest and yellowest on rump and abdomen; remiges and rectrices duskier, but under wing-coverts green.  Head, neck, and chest brown, throat tinged with olive, and ear-coverts with a grayish cast.  Wing length, 155&ndash;178 mm.</p>
				<p>The habitat of this parrot is evidently the more or less wooded savanna of the southern Sudanese border.  It does not approach the northern edge of the equatorial rain forest, and certainly does not occur near Niangara or Faradje.</p>

				<p><taxonName idx_name="Poicephalus gulielmi gulielmi">Poicephalus g. gulielmi</taxonName> is the only green parrot in the forests of the central Congo.  Though found from the Mayombe practically across the whole colony, it is nowhere so abundant and conspicuous as the gray parrot.  It goes about in small numbers, usually twos and threes; and its voice is harsher, lacking the clear whistles with which the cries of the gray parrot are interspersed.  The green parrot keeps very much to the tree-tops, and seems to be more of a seed-eater than a fruit-eater.  Some of the seeds, however, are soft and green; and in one stomach we found pieces of a few insects.</p>
				<p>Little can be said as to the breeding season except that only one adult, in mid-October, showed some enlargement of the gonads.  A year later, in the early part of the same month, natives brought us a brood of four young taken from a cavity in a tree.  The green plumage was beginning to appear, without a red or yellow feather anywhere; and the down that still clothed the body was grayish white.</p>
				<p>In adults the extent of red on crown and wings is not indicative of
<pb n="248" id="t000120-p00254c.tif"/> sex.  This green parrot is not considered a desirable pet, and is seldom seen in captivity.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;From eastern Cape Province and Natal to the vicinity of Dar-es-Salaam, Lake Tanganyika, the Kivu Volcanoes, the Katanga, northern Angola, and the Gaboon coast.  Reappearing in Upper Guinea, it is found from Togoland through the Gold Coast hinterland to the Gambia.</p>
				<p><taxon><taxonName idx_name="Poicephalus robustus robustus">P. r. robustus</taxonName> (Gmelin)</taxon> of South Africa has the lower mandible less than 23 mm. broad.  <taxonName idx_name="Poicephalus robustus suahelicus">P. r. suahelicus</taxonName>, which replaces it from Mashonaland north to Tanganyika Territory, the Kivu district, and Katanga, has a slightly larger beak&mdash;mandible 22.6&ndash;28.3 mm. broad&mdash;and lighter, more grayish head.  Adult females have the forehead and fore-crown bright red, whereas in males these parts are silvery gray, merely tinged with red.  <taxonName idx_name="Poicephalus robustus fuscicollis">P. r. fuscicollis</taxonName>, the Upper Guinea race, has likewise a large beak, with mandible 25 or 26 mm. in breadth, and green of underparts and rump less yellowish.</p>
				<p>From Angola Reichenow described <taxonName idx_name="Poicephalus robustus angolensis">P. r. angolensis</taxonName>, which Neumann<note n="1">1908, Nov. Zool., XV, p. 380.</note> regarded as inseparable from <taxonName idx_name="Poicephalus robustus suahelicus">suahelicus</taxonName>, while Bannerman (1931) found specimens from Angola to agree with <taxonName idx_name="Poicephalus robustus fuscicollis">fuscicollis</taxonName>.</p>
				<p>The Congo Museum has two specimens from the Kivu Volcanoes, ten from the highland near Baraka, two from Tembwe on Lake Tanganyika, two from the vicinity of Tenke, and sixteen from Funda Biabo.  A
<pb n="249" id="t000120-p00255c.tif"/> female from Tembwe is unusually light-colored, especially about the head.  Specimens from the Kivu district resemble those from the Katanga, though some of the former have the mandible a little wider.</p>
				<p>In Marungu and the Katanga <taxonName idx_name="Poicephalus robustus suahelicus">P. r. suahelicus</taxonName> occurs regularly at rather low levels, but in no great numbers.  It is seen flying over in pairs or small parties, calling loudly, or perching on the bare branches in tree-tops.  Northwest of Baraka and in the Kivu district it frequents the mountain forest.  On the slopes of Mikeno and Karisimbi I watched it passing over occasionally, usually in pairs, squawking disagreeably, at altitudes between 6700 and 12,000 feet.</p>

				<p><taxon><taxonName idx_name="Psittacus erithacus timneh">Psittacus e. timneh</taxonName> Fraser</taxon> is a small dark-colored race of Liberia and Sierra Leone.  The birds of Fernando Po and Princes Island have been separated as <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Psittacus erithacus princeps">P. e. princeps</taxonName> Alexander</taxon>, but at most they are only somewhat darker than the typical form on the adjacent mainland.</p>
				<p><taxonName idx_name="Psittacus erithacus erithacus">P. e. erithacus</taxonName> ranges from the eastern Ivory Coast to the Ubangi, the northern Uelle district, Unyoro, western Kenya Colony, the northern and western shores of Lake Victoria, and the southeast corner of Lake Tanganyika.  Elsewhere in the south it reaches the forest patches of the Kasai and probably the upper Kwango River.  Nearer the coast it seems scarcely to venture south of the lower Congo River, though numerous about Stanley Pool.</p>
				<pb n="251" id="t000120-p00257c.tif"/>
				<p>The gray parrot is one of the common and characteristic birds of the lowland forest belt in the Upper Congo, and has also been reported from the Mayombe forest.  In the gallery forests of the Uelle it is scarce, and we never saw it north of the Uelle and Kibali rivers.  On the east, too, it quickly diminishes in numbers beyond the edge of the solid forest. But in the Kasai district it is common far out in the forest patches that interrupt the savannas.  Near Boma and Matadi I never saw it.</p>
				<p>When feeding, these parrots keep almost entirely to the high forest trees, and might escape notice were it not for their raucous voices.  In flight they are conspicuous, with something a little duck-like in their wing-movements. Pairs are frequent, and flocks of fifteen to twenty are formed, apparently when they are not breeding.  The harsh screeches of gray parrots are constantly interrupted by clear, pleasant whistles.  No imitative sound have I ever heard from a wild parrot.  For a truly diurnal bird the gray parrot is exceptional in its habit of flying about and calling well after night has begun to fall.  It reawakens, too, at the first sign of approaching dawn.</p>
				<p>The off-season roosts of these birds are notable.  Evening after evening they will be seen passing over in the same direction to join their fellows for the night.  On Stanley Pool in the dry season they gather apparently at the upper end of Bamu Island.  Near Lukolela I watched them come to sleep on a group of a half-dozen Borassus palms in a grassy area surrounded by forest, until the assemblage numbered approximately two hundred.  This was in August, but the birds may have been using this roost for a month or more.  The sturdy leaves of the palms were already bowed down permanently from the parrots' weight.  Toward December the roost was abandoned.  A little north of the equator, along the Ituri River, I camped in February and March beneath some giant forest trees where fifteen or twenty gray parrots slept every night.</p>
				<p>All this would point to a definite breeding season during the rains; and at Lukolela we did find a pair sitting in some cavities in a large dead tree on December 12.  Near Medje, in the northern Ituri, we saw two nests in August and September.  There each &quot;parrot-tree&quot; had its jealous owner in some nearby village, waiting for the young birds that he would obtain from it.  They were articles of commerce, and nearly every post had six to a dozen captive parrots, mostly young.</p>
				<p>The natal down of gray parrots is white, as I saw it on several nestlings offered for sale on the Gaboon coast, just south of the equator, in early February.  The red tail-feathers of older birds are very fashionable millinery in all the Upper Congo.</p>
				<pb n="252" id="t000120-p00258c.tif"/>
				<p>One of the nests at Medje was within sight of the post, in a knot-hole of a huge isolated tree, 75 feet up.  Early in August a pair of birds entered it frequently.  A native climber reported eggs, and left them undisturbed. But the parrots became alarmed and were seldom seen thereafter.  Five weeks later the eggs were still there, and a flying squirrel had taken possession of the cavity.  These two eggs were pure white, with finely pitted surface, measuring 37.7 &times; 31.5 and 38.5 &times; 31.7 mm.  Three others, laid in captivity in New York, measure 36&ndash;38.4 mm. &times; 29&ndash;30.3.</p>
				<p>On the west coast gray parrots are said to raid maize-fields, but I have never seen this in the Congo.  Captive birds eat peanuts and palmnuts. In the wild state they consume various forest fruits and seeds, the latter often rather soft and green; and bits of quartz are occasionally found in their stomachs.  To get these they must come to the ground.</p>

				<p>MALE.&mdash;Iris grayish brown, rim of eyelids light brown; bill black; feet greenish brown, claws black.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;In summer, central Europe and western Asia as far as Kashmir, also North Africa.  A paler, more greenish race, <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Coracias garrulus semenowi">C. g. semenowi</taxonName> Loudon and Tschusi</taxon>, breeds from Persia eastward. The typical form migrates through western as well as eastern Africa and reaches Cape Province; but it is comparatively rare in the forested equatorial regions, over which it must pass rapidly and in no great numbers.  The main migration route is doubtless through East Africa.</p>
				<p>In all our stay in the Congo we saw it twice.  The bird collected at Medje was sitting on a large dead tree in a clearing, its posture very crowlike; that from Faradje was in bushy pastureland.  Father Callewaert has sent us one immature example from Luluabourg, Kasai district, taken on November 3.  The European roller is much more common in southern Africa, where it winters, than it is in any part of the Congo.</p>

				<p>SPECIMENS.&mdash;Dungu, &male;, Feb. 1. Faradje, 3 &male;, Jan. 28, Feb. 22, Mar. 10; &female;, Nov. 22.  Aba, &female; im., Dec. 21.</p>
				<p>MALE.&mdash;Iris brown, bill blackish, feet greenish brown.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;From Southern Arabia and Abyssinia across the whole Sudan to the coast of Senegal.  On the south it reaches northern Uganda and the savannas immediately north of the equatorial forest belt.  In my opinion <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Coracias abyssinica arabica">arabica</taxonName> Reichenow</taxon> and <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Coracias abyssinica arabica minor">minor</taxonName> Neumann</taxon> are not valid races.</p>
				<p>Within our limits the Abyssinian roller has been found only in the Uelle district.  Dubois&apos;s &quot;Ituri&quot; specimen must have come from there or from the Lado district.  From Dungu to Aba we found these rollers each year, arriving in November to spend the dry season, and retiring northward in March.  The internal condition of all our specimens showed that they did not breed there; and they are known to nest in the northern part of the range, in the French Niger Colony, the region of Lake Chad,<note n="1">Bates, 1927, Ibis, p. 25; 1934," idem, p. 224.</note> and Darfur,<note n="2">Lynes, 1925, Ibis, p. 385.</note> from April to June.  Nests are in natural cavities in trees, or sometimes in holes in mud walls.  The normal set of eggs is four, plain white, measuring around 30.3 &times; 25 mm.</p>
				<p>While in the Uelle the birds are not truly gregarious, and usually found here and there on the trees of the open savanna, preferably where it has been burned.  About a grass-fire, however, as many as eight were seen to gather.  Their flight is graceful, but no courting antics are indulged in at this season, and the only note heard was a hoarse, rasping &quot;kah-k-k-k-k-k&quot; that bore a faint resemblance only to that of <taxonName>Eurystomus afer</taxonName>.</p>
				<p>Four out of five stomachs examined held grasshoppers of varying sizes, and large winged ants were present once.  One bird at least had eaten slender green grasshoppers of the genus <taxonName>Homocoryphus</taxonName>, which were being captured that same day for food by Logo natives, while a small flock of kites (<taxonName>Milvus</taxonName>) hovered over them in the same pursuit.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;British Somaliland and Shoa, south through East Africa to the Vaal River, and west to Angola.  The northeastern part of the range is occupied by <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Coracias caudata lorti">C. c. lorti</taxonName> Shelley</taxon>, with lilac color restricted to fore-neck and ear-region, which has been taken as far south as Mombasa, Tsavo, and Naivasha in Kenya Colony.  There it is within the area occupied by <taxonName idx_name="Coracias caudata caudata">C. c. caudata</taxonName>, ranging from Natal north to Lamu, the Laikipia Plateau, Mt. Elgon, Kager and Ruzizi valleys, Kongolo on the Lualaba, Luluabourg in the Kasai district, and Ambriz in northern Angola.  The overlapping of <taxonName idx_name="Coracias caudata lorti">lorti</taxonName> and <taxonName idx_name="Coracias caudata caudata">caudata</taxonName> may be due to migration, but the former is a very distinct race, showing some approach to <taxonName idx_name="Coracias abyssinica">C. abyssinica</taxonName>.</p>
				<p>The lilac-chested roller is a rather common bird in the southeastern savannas of the Congo, from the Ruzizi Valley to the Katanga and the Kasai.  The record from Lake Kivu may be questioned, for in all this region it inhabits especially the river-valleys and low ground, being rare or wanting on the higher plateaus.  A noisy, quarrelsome bird, it perches on the tops of the taller trees and flies out to pursue smaller birds and even the brown kite.</p>
				<p>B&ouml;hm and Alexander regarded the species as somewhat migratory in Tanganyika Territory and on the Zambesi.  The specimens we received from Luluabourg were all taken between June 30 and August 23, yet at Kongolo H.C. Raven secured five in February.  Breeding is reported from Kenya Colony as well as from southern Africa.  While so engaged, the males are said to mount high in the air, and then with an abrupt somersault to shoot straight down to earth again.</p>
				<p>In Nyasaland and Southern Rhodesia nesting is carried on from September to November in holes in trees, where two or three white eggs are laid.  Belcher gave the average dimensions of eggs as 32.2 &times; 26.5 mm.</p>
				<pb n="256" id="t000120-p00262c.tif"/>
				<p>The food consists largely of insects such as beetles and grasshoppers, often captured at grass-fires, but sometimes includes small snakes, lizards, or small birds.</p>

The Congo Museum has four skins from Tembwe on Lake Tanganyika, one each from Elisabethville, Nieuwdorp, Kanzenze, and the Kando River, and two from Dilolo.</p>
				<p>The racquet-tailed roller was found by Neave to be a common bird on the Katanga Plateau, less numerous on the low ground of that district. During the latter half of the rains it was usually in family parties, a pair of adults with three or four younger birds.  Marshall found that it perched on the lower branches in woods close to watercourses, not on the summits of trees in more open places.  While courting, it &quot;will fly with a very rapid zig-zag for some distance, and then suddenly shoot straight up into the air for fifteen or twenty feet with closed wings, curving gently over and down again head foremost, screaming all the while.&quot; Marshall compared its cries to the yelping of a litter of puppies.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;From Senegambia across the whole Sudan to Eritrea, Abyssinia, and Somaliland.  Then south through Kenya Colony and Tanganyika Territory to Natal and the Orange River. From the vicinity of Lake Bangweolo the range also extends westward to Damaraland and Angola north to Ambriz.</p>

				<p><taxonName idx_name="Coracias n&aelig;via mosambica">Coracias n. mosambica</taxonName> invades our territory only in the Upper Katanga and Lomami district.  It is a rare bird&mdash;according to Neave&mdash; west of the Mchinga Escarpment.  There is no record from the Kasai, or even from Lake Tanganyika.</p>
				<p>The purple roller is usually less sociable than most members of the genus <taxonName>Coracias</taxonName>, and seen singly or in pairs, keeping a lookout from trees and then flying down upon its small prey of insects, other arthropods, and occasional small reptiles.  It has harsh, grating notes, and during the breeding season&mdash;the beginning of the rains&mdash;rises in the air with a sidewise rocking or rolling, as though the wings were beaten unequally. The descending part of this flight was compared by Andersson to the movements of a paper kite after the string has been broken.</p>
				<p>The nest is a hollow in a tree, often an old woodpecker&apos;s nest; and the eggs are white, approximately 34 &times; 28 mm.</p>

				<p>ADULT MALE.&mdash;Iris dark brown; bill yellow; feet dark greenish brown, claws black.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;Supposedly from Senegal, but more probably from Sierra Leone, east to Uganda and south to northern Angola. <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Eurystomus gularis gularis">E. g. gularis</taxonName> Vieillot</taxon> is restricted to the Upper Guinea forests, intergrading with <taxonName idx_name="Eurystomus gularis neglectus">E. g. neglectus</taxonName> in Nigeria.  The latter race, which is more strongly washed with violet beneath and has violet-blue upper tail-coverts, occupies the Lower Guinea forest, and reaches the Bugoma forest in Uganda.  It seems not to range north into the gallery forests of the Uelle, though on the south it is found in the forest patches of the Kasai and northern Angola, and the Congo Museum has one specimen from Luvungi in the Ruzizi Valley.</p>
				<p>The blue-throated roller is essentially a forest bird, only occasionally seen near clearings or villages.  It perches on the tallest forest trees and
<pb n="259" id="t000120-p00265c.tif"/> flies over them with a shrill &quot;kwe, kwe, kwe,&mdash;&quot; or &quot;kwi, kwi, kwi,&quot; very different from the calls of <taxonName idx_name="Eurystomus afer">E. afer</taxonName>.  Pairs, or family parties of four or five are the rule.  While neither <taxonName idx_name="Eurystomus gularis">gularis</taxonName> nor <taxonName idx_name="Eurystomus afer">afer</taxonName> really rolls or tumbles in the air, both make long swooping flights.  I have watched <taxonName idx_name="Eurystomus gularis">gularis</taxonName> holding its wings rigid, pointing considerably below the horizontal, while it sped obliquely downward.</p>
				<p>At Medje a nestling was obtained from natives in early May, and at Lukolela I saw a pair on November 22, coming to their nest in a hole in the top of a dead tree-trunk, at the edge of a clearing.  A few days later one of their young was brought to me.  So breeding takes place at the beginning of the rains, and possibly at other times as well.  The young of <taxonName idx_name="Eurystomus gularis">gularis</taxonName> can be distinguished from those of <taxonName idx_name="Eurystomus afer">afer</taxonName> by their deeper rufous color on upperparts, with greater upper tail-coverts black.</p>
				<p>The food of this roller is taken on the wing, and consists almost entirely of insects.  In the four stomachs examined, beetles were commonest, among them one elater, but many large winged ants were noted in one case.  A young bird in captivity ate a small mouse.</p>

				<p><taxon><taxonName idx_name="Eurystomus afer pulcherrimus">E. a. pulcherrimus</taxonName> Neumann</taxon>, of Angola and the southern Kasai district, is like <taxonName idx_name="Eurystomus afer suahelicus">suahelicus</taxonName> but darker rufous above, upper tail-coverts often deeper blue, and the lilac wash of the underparts more pronounced.</p>
				<p>Examination of about one hundred and fifty specimens in the Congo Museum shows that <taxonName idx_name="Eurystomus afer afer">E. a. afer</taxonName> occupies the whole western part of the colony eastward probably to Bumba, and south to the Lower Congo, Leverville in the Kwango district, and Luebo in the Kasai.  In the eastern Congo forest <taxonName idx_name="Eurystomus afer rufobuccalis">rufobuccalis</taxonName> takes its place.  Some specimens from the Uelle are supposedly <taxonName idx_name="Eurystomus afer &aelig;thiopicus">&aelig;thiopicus</taxonName>.  The southeastern Congo is occupied by <taxonName idx_name="Eurystomus afer suahelicus">suahelicus</taxonName>, and the only specimens which seem surely referable to <taxonName idx_name="Eurystomus afer pulcherrimus">pulcherrimus</taxonName> are from the southern Kasai and Dilolo.  Those from near Lusambo are mostly intermediates.</p>
				<p>The typical race is common throughout the area mentioned above,
<pb n="261" id="t000120-p00267c.tif"/> in forests and savannas alike.  Since its habits are the same as those of <taxonName idx_name="Eurystomus afer rufobuccalis">rufobuccalis</taxonName>, they need not be discussed here.</p>

				<p>SPECIMENS.&mdash;Avakubi, &male;, Oct. 7; &female;, Nov. 10; &male; im., Apr. 14; &female; im., June 8.  Bafwabaka, &male;, Jan. 6; &male; im., Dec. 28.  Medje, 3 &male;, Jan. 17, Mar. &mdash;, May 10; &female;, &female; juv., May 10.  Niangara, &male;, May 18.  Nzoro, &male;, Apr. 10.</p>
				<p>ADULTS.&mdash;Iris brownish gray to dark brown, rim of eyelids dark brown; bill yellow; feet brownish green or greenish brown.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;From Uganda westward into the northeastern Congo, to the southern Uelle and Ituri districts, and probably to the lower Aruwimi and the forests to the southward.  Sassi has reported young individuals of this race from the northern end of Lake Tanganyika, but the race to be expected there is <taxonName idx_name="Eurystomus afer suahelicus">suahelicus</taxonName>.  Although common along the eastern edge of the Congo forest near Irumu and the Semliki Valley, <taxonName idx_name="Eurystomus afer rufobuccalis">rufobuccalis</taxonName> is a bird of the lowlands, and does not ascend much above 4500 feet.</p>
				<p>Otherwise this race of the cinnamon roller is a very adaptable bird, making its home on the higher trees near watercourses or swamps in the more open savanna countries, and then in heavily forested districts becoming
<pb n="262" id="t000120-p00268c.tif"/> a bird of clearings.  At certain places in the Cameroon, situated in almost unbroken forest, Bates<note n="1">1911, Ibis, p. 511.</note> notes that <taxonName>Eurystomus afer</taxonName> was not to be found.  Similarly along the road from Stanleyville to Bafwasende, in 1909, <taxonName idx_name="Eurystomus afer">E. afer</taxonName> was scarcely to be noticed, and <taxonName idx_name="Eurystomus gularis">E. gularis</taxonName> the only common roller.</p>
				<p>At Avakubi, Ngayu, and Medje, however, the present species became rather common about clearings, usually taking station on higher branches, whence it could fly after passing insects, or give chase to any large bird that approached.  Its loud, harsh &quot;ra-a-ack&mdash;ra-a-ack&mdash;ra-a-ack-k-k-k-k&quot; became one of the commonest noises, a rather parrot-like sound when heard the first time.  The broad-mouthed rollers become more active toward sunset, and it was surprising at times to see how late in the twilight the present species continued hawking for insects over open plots near villages.  Sometimes a second look was needed to be sure they were not large bats.</p>
				<p>In the Ituri district and northward to Niangara in the Uelle, <taxonName idx_name="Eurystomus afer rufobuccalis">E. a. rufobuccalis</taxonName> is to be seen throughout the year.  In savannas it frequents only the taller trees near water.  The breeding season comes apparently during the early part of the rains, for specimens taken at Avakubi in October and November were not breeding, slight enlargement of the gonads was noticeable in January, and in May a nestling was secured from a cavity high up in a tree.  The eggs of this race seem never to have been collected; but those of <taxonName idx_name="Eurystomus afer afer">E. a. afer</taxonName> are described by Shuel<note n="2">1938, Ibis, pp. 469, 470.</note> as glossy and pure white, 32&ndash;38 mm. &times; 27&ndash;28.  He found a set of three near Kano, Northern Nigeria, on June 22.</p>
				<p>Few careful notes were kept of the insects I found in stomachs of this roller.  On two occasions, however, I did record winged ants: once a full meal of them, the other time a single individual of unusually large size. The food of the species in other regions is known to include beetles, grasshoppers, moths, and hymenoptera.</p>

				<p>SPECIMEN.&mdash;Faradje, &male;, Apr. 11.</p>
				<pb n="263" id="t000120-p00269c.tif"/>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;From Eritrea and southern Abyssinia to Darfur, where it is said to begin to intergrade with <taxonName idx_name="Eurystomus afer afer">afer</taxonName>, to the Uelle district, where it approaches <taxonName idx_name="Eurystomus afer rufobuccalis">rufobuccalis</taxonName>, and to northern Uganda.</p>
				<p>Some specimens from the Uelle are certainly not <taxonName idx_name="Eurystomus afer rufobuccalis">rufubuccalis</taxonName>, for they have more violet on cheeks and underparts, and their upper tail-coverts are entirely greenish blue.  The median rectrices are not wholly black, but more or less bluish over the basal two-third.  Wings of nine such Uelle specimens, 174&ndash;183 mm.</p>
				<p>While I follow Sclater and Praed in calling them <taxonName idx_name="Eurystomus afer &aelig;thiopicus">&aelig;thiopicus</taxonName>, I am not sure that they would not better be referred to <taxonName idx_name="Eurystomus afer suahelicus">suahelicus</taxonName>.  The same is true of Christy&apos;s specimens from Yambio, which I have seen.</p>
				<p>Rollers of this species, while common at all seasons near Niangara, seemed regularly migratory in the vicinity of Faradje and Garamba. Entirely wanting there in the dry season, they reappeared in March, in 1912, at least, on the 26th.  From then on they were frequently seen, as along the Dungu River near Faradje, until about October, and disappeared before the rains had ceased.  Where they go is difficult to guess, for to the north in the Sudan they are likewise seldom seen except from March to September, inclusive.<note n="1">See Sclater and M.-Praed, (1919), and Lynes, 1925, Ibis, pp. 386, 387.</note>  Lynes found a very young bird with its mother in Darfur on September 9.  It seems likely that they breed also in the Uelle.</p>
				<p>Specimens from Dramba and Mauda are more or less intermediate between <taxonName idx_name="Eurystomus afer &aelig;thiopicus">&aelig;thiopicus</taxonName> and <taxonName idx_name="Eurystomus afer rufobuccalis">rufobuccalis</taxonName>, while from Buta the Congo Museum has two skins with the rump as in <taxonName idx_name="Eurystomus afer &aelig;thiopicus">&aelig;thiopicus</taxonName>, and seven that are more like <taxonName idx_name="Eurystomus afer rufobuccalis">rufobuccalis</taxonName> or afer.  Three from Mahagi Port are <taxonName idx_name="Eurystomus afer &aelig;thiopicus">&aelig;thiopicus</taxonName>. In West Africa <taxonName idx_name="Eurystomus afer afer">E. a. afer</taxonName> is believed to move northward into the savannas during the rains, and southward to the forest during the drought; but this cannot be the case with the birds of the Uelle.  I believe that <taxonName idx_name="Eurystomus afer rufobuccalis">rufobuccalis</taxonName> is resident in the more wooded sections, and that the migrants are those here called tentatively <taxonName idx_name="Eurystomus afer &aelig;thiopicus">&aelig;thiopicus</taxonName>.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;From Lamu on the coast of Kenya Colony, the highlands near Nairobi, the vicinity of Lake Kivu, probably even the upper Semliki Valley, and the southeastern Congo to Southern Rhodesia and occasionally to the Transvaal.  A specimen from Kongolo, in the U. S. National Museum, shows how close this race comes to the southern edge of the forest belt.</p>
				<p>B&ouml;hm saw the cinnamon roller a number of times in Marungu and the Katanga during September, October, and November.  Neave, after longer experience, stated that it was apparently migratory in the Katanga, present only from about September to March.  Twenty-nine Katanga specimens in the Congo Museum were all collected between August and April, inclusive.  They come from Kinda, Funda Biabo, Lake Musolo, Kanzenze, Elisabethville, Nieuwdorp, and Lukafu. Wings of adults measure 169&ndash;187 mm., and of two that retain juvenal primaries, 164, 165.</p>

				<p>SPECIMEN.&mdash;Between Niangara and Dungu, &female; im., June 9.</p>
				<p>IMMATURE FEMALE.&mdash;Iris dark brown; bill yellow with a dusky brown patch on top of maxilla; feet dark brownish green.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;Madagascar and Anjuan Island, migrating to eastern Africa, the Katanga, the Kasai district, and even to the vicinity of Bolobo, Nouvelle Anvers, Buta, and the savannas of the Upper Uelle district.</p>
				<p>One rainy day in June, 1911, I came upon the largest flock of rollers I had ever seen, numbering at least two dozen, flying about over the open savanna, taking insects on the wing, and alighting occasionally in trees.  They uttered no sound, but impressed me by their size; and I went after them through the wet grass.  They were so wary that I could secure only one immature bird.  We never saw the species again. Three years later, Dr. Christy obtained three males at Poko, between July 8 and 13.</p>
				<p>Among the older specimens in the Congo Museum I have since found two <taxonName idx_name="Eurystomus glaucurus">glaucurus</taxonName> from Banalia (Nahan) and one from Nouvelle Anvers (de la K&eacute;thulle).  In addition to the published records, cited above, there are specimens now in the Congo Museum from Kansenia, Katanga (de Witte), Tembwe, L. Tanganyika (Dr. Schouteden), Tshipama, Kasai (Drion), and Elisabetha, upper Congo R. (Mme. Tinant).  Father Callewaert sent us three adults from Luluabourg.</p>
				<p>My migration map<note n="1">1932, Bull, A. M. N. H., LXV, p. 351, Fig. 168.</note> already needs revision, for this roller does invade
<pb n="266" id="t000120-p00272c.tif"/> the Upper Congo forest.  The period of occurrence in the Congo is also much longer than I supposed.  At Tembwe it was taken in February, at Kansenia on March 5, at Kabalo&mdash;two in complete juvenal dress&mdash; on March 30, and at Kunungu April 3.  The dates of occurrence in the Uelle are from May 14 to July 13, while in the Kasai one has been secured as late as November 13.</p>

				<p>SPECIMENS.&mdash;Lower Congo, &female;, July.  Boma, &female;, Jan. 16.  Rungu, 2 &female;, Oct, 30.  Niangara, &female;, June 19.  Nzoro, &female;, Aug. 6.  Faradje, 2 &female;, Feb. 2, Nov. 23.</p>
				<p>ADULT FEMALE.&mdash;Iris dark brown; maxilla dusky brownish, mandible orange-red with tip brown; feet orange-red, larger scales brown, claws blackish.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;From Senegal, Lake Chad, and Abyssinia south to the Orange and Vaal rivers, but unknown in the forest districts of both Upper and Lower Guinea.</p>
				<p>The species has been divided by Hartert<note n="1">1921, Nov. Zool., XXVIII, pp. 106, 107.</note> into three races, the palest of which, <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Halcyon chelicuti eremogiton">H. c. eremogiton</taxonName> Hartert</taxon>, has the wing about 75&ndash;82 mm. long, and lives along the southern margin of the Sahara from the neighborhood of Zinder and Lake Chad eastward to Akona and Kodok on the White Nile.  Specimens from southern Africa are largest, with wings 81&ndash;90 mm. and as a rule their coloration is dark.  For these the name <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Halcyon chelicuti damarensis">H. c. damarensis</taxonName> Strickland</taxon><note n="2">1852, Jardine&apos;s Contrib. Orn., p. 153 (Damara country).</note> may be used.  <taxonName idx_name="Halcyon chelicuti chelicuti">H. c. chelicuti</taxonName>, described from Abyssinia, is more or less intermediate in wing-length, and often in coloration.  Birds of this nature are found from Abyssinia and the Sudan west to Senegal, south through eastern Africa to the Zambesi, and westward across northern Angola and the southern Congo to Landana.</p>
				<p>Grote (1925) proposed the separation of birds from the whole equatorial belt near the Congo as <taxonName idx_name="Halcyon chelicuti hylobius">hylobius</taxonName>, but their characters are very elusive.  Some specimens from the Uelle seem a little dark on the breast, but the majority cannot be distinguished from Abyssinian specimens or from those of the Kasai.  Fifteen Uelle specimens have wings 79&ndash;85 mm., twelve from Luluabourg in the Kasai have them 76&ndash;82, and forty from the Upper Katanga 78&ndash;87.  Eight examples from Dangila and Maraco, Abyssinia, show wing-lengths varying exactly as in those from Luluabourg.  Skins from the eastern Congo have wings no longer than those of the Uelle or Kasai, and while this measurement is slightly greater in the Katanga, I do not regard <taxonName idx_name="Halcyon chelicuti damarensis">H. c. damarensis</taxonName> as reaching the Belgian Congo.</p>
				<pb n="269" id="t000120-p00275c.tif"/>
				<p>Even if <taxonName idx_name="Halcyon chelicuti hylobius">hylobius</taxonName> were valid, it is antedated by <taxon><taxonName>Alcedo variegata</taxonName> Vieillot</taxon> and <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Alcedo striolata">A. striolata</taxonName> Lichtenstein</taxon>.  From eastern Africa Stoneham also described <taxonName idx_name="Halcyon chelicuti ph&aelig;thon">ph&aelig;thon</taxonName> and <taxonName idx_name="Halcyon chelicuti zinjense">zinjense</taxonName>, on characters which seem insufficient.</p>
				<p>Throughout the lowland savannas of the whole Congo the little striped kingfisher is a common bird; and while it does not ascend the mountains of the eastern Congo border, as it does the highlands of Northeast Africa, two specimens have been taken at Kansenia, 5200 feet, on the Biano Plateau.  For river banks it has no liking whatever. It sits on the gnarled trees of the drier upland, or about native farms, silent most of the time, but ever on the lookout for passing insects.</p>
				<p>The voice is nevertheless one of the notable sounds of this type of country, and is characteristically divided in two parts, often repeated. Variable as to length, it may usually be written &quot;tirrrrrrr-rruh!&quot;  Two birds often call shrilly in unison, either perched together on the same branch&mdash;like <taxonName idx_name="Halcyon senegalensis">H. senegalensis</taxonName>&mdash;or from trees some distance apart, sitting stiffly upright with outspread wings during the reiterated trilling cries. There is a certain moment between sunset and dark when all the striped kingfishers within hearing call together.  Scattered birds on all sides take it up, like an evening prayer or a last good-night, which they relay every evening, weather permitting, right across the African continent. Then they are silent till dawn, when they again become noisy.</p>
				<p>The nest of <taxonName>Halcyon chelicuti</taxonName> is usually in holes in trees, sometimes in an old nest of a barbet or woodpecker, or even in a mud nest of a swallow like <taxonName>Hirundo abyssinica</taxonName>.<note n="1">Boxberger, 1910, O. Mb., pp. 63, 64.</note>  Its eggs are white, three to five in a set; and measurements from other parts of Africa have been given as 24&ndash;25 mm. &times; 20.5&ndash;22.</p>
				<p>The diet is of insects, grasshoppers especially; and in four stomachs we noted also a mantis, a cicada, and a green caterpillar.</p>

				<p>SPECIMENS.&mdash;Batama, &female;, Sept. 16.  Avakubi, 4 &male;, Feb. 11, Mar. 29, June 2, Nov. 1.  Bafwabaka, 2 &female;, Dec. 30, 31.  Medje, &male;, Jan. 19; &female; juv., Oct. 15. Pawa, &female;, July 14.  Niangara, &male;, Dec. 14.</p>

				<p>YOUNG FEMALE.&mdash;Iris gray, rim of eyelids buff; bill brownish black, its tip and the corners of mouth orange; feet blackish; back of metatarsus and soles brown.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;From Liberia through the forests of Upper Guinea to the southern Cameroon and Loango Coast, eastward across the Congo to Uganda.  Southward it reaches the southern Kasai district, although not yet collected in the Belgian Mayombe. <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Halcyon badia lopezi">H. b. lopezi</taxonName> Alexander</taxon> is an island race restricted to Fernando Po; and <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Halcyon badia budongoensis">H. b. budongoensis</taxonName> van Someren</taxon>, of large size (wing 100&ndash;105 mm.), with lighter chestnut crown and back, and blue on wings more greenish, inhabits the forests of western and central Uganda.  The remainder of the area is occupied by <taxonName idx_name="Halcyon badia badia">H. b. badia</taxonName>, with wings of Congo specimens usually 92&ndash;100 mm.  A female in the Congo Museum from Lesse in the Semliki Valley has the wing 105 mm. but is colored like <taxonName idx_name="Halcyon badia badia">badia</taxonName>.</p>
				<p>The chestnut-backed kingfisher is a common, characteristic forest bird of the Ituri, southern Uelle, and the other heavily wooded lowlands of the Congo.  Yet it is easily overlooked, for it seldom if ever visits gardens or other open spots.  Along river banks it is less in evidence than <taxonName idx_name="Halcyon senegalensis">H. senegalensis</taxonName>, and probably visits watercourses only to bathe, eating neither fish nor amphibia.</p>
				<p>In its beloved forests it usually keeps 20 or 30 feet above the ground, and often higher, where it would scarcely be noticed save for its voice. This is a characteristic sound of the forest, a prolonged series of rather slow whistles, lasting at least seven seconds.  Not shrill in tone, they descend the scale gradually and die away.  Their hollow quality makes it difficult to locate the bird, yet they carry a great distance, and scarcely suggest a kingfisher.  I believe it has also some more excited notes in its vocabulary.</p>
				<p>My dissections indicated a rather long and irregular breeding season. A female with ovary enlarged was obtained in September, and a young bird just out of the nest in October (at Medje).  Another young bird was seen at Barumbu in December, so I believe that north of the equator nesting is carried on from July to November, during the rains.</p>
				<pb n="271" id="t000120-p00277c.tif"/>
				<p>The nest has not been found in the Congo.  Bates&apos;s first set of two glossy white eggs was said to have come from a hole in a tree, but later he received two nestlings from a cavity in an arboreal ants' nest.  Finally another set of two eggs was brought with a male bird, and he was able to examine the solid hanging ant or termite structure in which the nest-hole had been excavated, possibly by woodpeckers.<note n="1">Bates, 1909, Ibis, p. 24; 1911," idem, pp. 513, 514.</note>  The eggs measured 26&ndash;29 mm. &times; 24&ndash;26.  The juvenal plumage in this species is surprisingly like that of the adult, but has a buffy wash on flanks and across chest, while the lower back is often more blackish.</p>
				<p>Every one of the nine stomachs examined held insects, among which orthoptera and coleoptera predominated.  There were grasshoppers in three cases, and I noted in particular a cricket, a mantis, an earwig, an elater, a hemipter, and a large cicada.  A single large spider had also been eaten.</p>

				<p>According to its describer, this race extends from Uganda to the Ituri forest.  It is true that a specimen from Lesse in the Semliki is large enough for <taxonName idx_name="Halcyon badia budongoensis">budongoensis</taxonName>, but unless there is also some difference in color I prefer not to recognize such a race.  The wings of fifteen other specimens from the Ituri and southern Uelle measure 92&ndash;100 mm., while two from the region of Bolobo have them 94 and 99 mm.</p>

				<p>ADULT MALE.&mdash;Iris dark brown; bill rather dark red becoming blackish at tip; feet red on softer parts, but scales and claws brown.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;Eastern Cape Province north to the Loango Coast, Lake Tanganyika, Mt. Kenya, and Southern Somaliland. <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Halcyon albiventris albiventris">H. a. albiventris</taxonName> (Scopoli)</taxon> occupies the southern part of the range, as far north as Southern Rhodesia.</p>
				<p><taxonName idx_name="Halcyon albiventris orientalis">H. a. orientalis</taxonName>, with less pronounced streaking on chest and usually shorter wings (97&ndash;106 mm.), ranges from Portuguese East Africa and Mashonaland to the Tana River, Lake Tanganyika, the Kasai district, and the coast of southern Gaboon.  A pair from Lukafu in the Katanga have wings 110 and 109 mm.  <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Halcyon albiventris erlangeri">H. a. erlangeri</taxonName> Neumann</taxon> of southern Somaliland is stated to have shorter wings, 92&ndash;97 mm.<note n="1"><taxon><taxonName idx_name="Halcyon albiventris prentissgrayi">H. a. prentissgrayi</taxonName> Bowen</taxon>, from Meru, Mt. Kenya, was based on a single very dark individual.</note>  The sexes are readily distinguishable in this kingfisher by the color of the back, which is blackish in males, brown in females.</p>
				<p>In the Congo <taxonName idx_name="Halcyon albiventris orientalis">H. a. orientalis</taxonName> does not occupy the whole of the southern savannas, for in the east it scarcely ranges north of Mpala and the limits of the Upper Katanga.  On the higher plateaus it is rare, though de Witte obtained a pair at Kansenia.  There is but a single record from the Kasai, yet the Congo Museum has a specimen from Eala, and I have seen it once at Lukolela.  Dybowski&apos;s specimen did not come from the Ubangi River, but from Loango.</p>
				<p>In the Lower Congo, on the other hand, I found this kingfisher rather common, frequenting open groves, as of Ceara rubber trees near Boma, on high ground.  They were quiet, though the species is said to have a loud voice like that of <taxonName idx_name="Halcyon leucocephala">H. leucocephala</taxonName>.  Breeding is probably carried on in the first half of the rains, the nest being in a tunnel in a bank, with four white eggs.  The measurements of an egg from Dar-es-Salaam were given by Nehrkorn as 26.5 &times; 24 mm.</p>

				<p>ADULTS.&mdash;Iris dark brown, bill and feet red.</p>
				<p>NESTLINGS (feathers just sprouting).&mdash;Skin of body flesh-color; iris brownish gray; tip of bill and corners of mouth dull orange-yellow, middle part of bill blackish; feet yellow below, scales above dusky brownish.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;From the Cape Verde Islands and Senegal east to Abyssinia and Southern Arabia; south through the eastern half of Africa to the Vaal River, and west again to the Kwango district, Angola, and Damaraland.  Very rare in the equatorial forest belt.</p>
				<p><taxonName idx_name="Halcyon leucocephala leucocephala">H. l. leucocephala</taxonName>, ranging from Senegal to Abyssinia, has the abdomen deep rufous and the blue of wings, rump, and tail tinged with green.  <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Halcyon leucocephala acteon">H. l. acteon</taxonName> (Lesson)</taxon> of the Cape Verde Islands is larger, and its blue feathers a little less greenish.  <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Halcyon leucocephala semic&aelig;rulea">H. l. semic&aelig;rulea</taxonName> (Gmelin)</taxon> of Yemen and the Aden Protectorate is also less greenish blue on wings and tail.</p>
				<p>The very different <taxonName idx_name="Halcyon leucocephala pallidiventris">H. l. pallidiventris</taxonName>, living south of the forest belt, has the abdomen pale rufous and the blue areas strikingly violaceous. In eastern Africa there is practical intergradation between <taxonName idx_name="Halcyon leucocephala pallidiventris">pallidiventris</taxonName> and <taxonName idx_name="Halcyon leucocephala leucocephala">leucocephala</taxonName>.  <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Halcyon leucocephala hyacinthina">H. l. hyacinthina</taxonName> Reichenow</taxon>, from Zanzibar to Lake Nyasa, is like the former, but with deeper rufous abdomen.  Farther north the blue parts become somewhat less violaceous, and <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Halcyon leucocephala centralis">H. l. centralis</taxonName> Neumann</taxon> is intermediate between <taxonName idx_name="Halcyon leucocephala hyacinthina">hyacinthina</taxonName> and <taxonName idx_name="Halcyon leucocephala leucocephala">leucocephala</taxonName>.</p>
				<p>In the Congo typical <taxonName idx_name="Halcyon leucocephala leucocephala">leucocephala</taxonName> is found only in the northern savannas, near the Ubangi and Uelle rivers, and in those near Lake Albert and Lake Edward.  In the Uelle it is migratory, appearing in November and leaving late in April.  At Kasenyi on Lake Albert it may be resident, I saw several in August.  Near the upper Semliki I collected two specimens in January and February, while de Witte took one in the Ruindi Plain in November.</p>
				<p>The birds of the Uelle must move northward into the Sudan, and while many of them nest in Congo territory in March and early April,
<pb n="274" id="t000120-p00280c.tif"/> Lynes found this kingfisher breeding also in Darfur in May and June. While in the southern part of their range, these gray-headed kingfishers scatter over the dry savannas, cultivated fields, and river banks.  They perch singly or in very small parties, and dart down on their insect prey with wings gleaming in the sun.  While sitting they raise and lower the head from time to time with a slight jerk.  The weak, dry voice has been written &quot;ji - ji - ji - chi,&quot; but it may also be a more prolonged chattering.</p>
				<p>Near Faradje, along the banks of the River Atua, numbers of pairs used to nest, digging tunnels about a yard long and laying two to four smooth white eggs, most often three.  My measurements of two sets of eggs are 24.1&ndash;24.5 mm. &times; 21.5&ndash;22.8.</p>
				<p>Of six stomachs examined every one contained insect remains, and one a spider.  The insects were mainly beetles and grasshoppers, but three crickets, one roach, and a hemipter were also noticed.</p>

				</p>
				<p>In the Congo Museum there is a dark-bellied specimen from Beni, which though labeled as female, has a little rufous on the border of the hind-neck and is more probably a male.  The blue on its wings and tail is much more violaceous than in typical <taxonName idx_name="Halcyon leucocephala leucocephala">leucocephala</taxonName>, agreeing with the color in males from Lake Baringo and the Turkwell River.  It may therefore be regarded provisionally as <taxonName idx_name="Halcyon leucocephala centralis">centralis</taxonName>.

				<p>SPECIMENS.&mdash;Medje, &male;, July 26; &female;, Aug. 3.</p>
				<p>ADULTS.&mdash;Iris dark brown; bill red, a little dusky at tip; feet red, with claws very dark brown.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;From Damaraland and the Vaal River north to the southern edge of the Upper Congo forest, but not in the Lower Congo.  It even crosses the forest in small numbers to Buta and Poko. To the east of the forest it ranges north to the vicinity of Beni; but its distribution in eastern Africa is uncertain north of Nyasaland.</p>
				<p><taxonName idx_name="Halcyon leucocephala pallidiventris">H. l. pallidiventris</taxonName> is a common bird in the savannas of the southern Congo, from Kwamouth and the Kwango district to the Upper Katanga, Lake Tanganyika, and the Manyema.  It appears to be migratory, and our fourteen specimens from Luluabourg were all collected by Father Callewaert between May 21 and August 14.  The Congo Museum specimens from the Manyema and vicinity were likewise taken between May 23 and September 14, and those reported from Mokia, Beni, and Moera, May 10 to August.  In the Upper Katanga dates of occurrence run from April 26 to October, with one sight record in December.</p>
				<p>This race nests in the northern part of its range during the dry season, for Dr. Schouteden collected three large nestlings at Luebo on August 28, and Lynes reported a male in breeding condition at Banda in the western Kasai, in October.  Nests have been found in Angola in September, in Northern Rhodesia from September to November, and in Nyasaland from October to December.  In Southern Rhodesia Priest says this kingfisher is most plentiful from October to March, the rainy season, and then breeds freely.</p>
				<p>The occurrence of <taxonName idx_name="Halcyon leucocephala pallidiventris">pallidiventris</taxonName> along the northern border of the
<pb n="276" id="t000120-p00282c.tif"/> forest is surprising.  I first collected two at Medje, then Christy found one at Poko, and Hutereau sent another from Ibembo.  In recent years Brother Hutsebaut has collected ten at Buta, of which only three are adults.  Adults with reliable dates from this northern area were all taken in April, July, and August, but immature birds are there also in January, March, April, and May.  <taxonName idx_name="Halcyon leucocephala leucocephala">H. l. leucocephala</taxonName> is likewise rather common at Buta in the dry season.  We do not know whether <taxonName idx_name="Halcyon leucocephala pallidiventris">pallidiventris</taxonName> nests at Buta.</p>
				<p>The habits and nests of the present form are similar to those of <taxonName idx_name="Halcyon leucocephala leucocephala">leucocephala</taxonName>.  The eggs occasionally number as many as six, though three or four are probably normal; and measurements have been given as 23.5&ndash;25.4 mm. &times; 20.0&ndash;22.3.</p>
				<p>The stomachs of our two birds from Medje contained a few large winged ants, two grasshoppers, a mole-cricket, and a hawk-moth. One examined by Marshall in South Africa had eaten a lizard, two &quot;slow-worms,&quot; grasshoppers, and beetles.</p>

				<p>NESTLINGS.&mdash;Iris gray; color of bill variable, in one case entirely blackish except at tip, in two others it was very largely orange, even below.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;From the Gambia and northern Abyssinia south to Damaraland and the Orange River.  Three races may be distinguished.  In the heavy forests of both Upper and Lower Guinea many birds have dusky crowns, even when fully adult.  These are rightly called <taxonName idx_name="Halcyon senegalensis fuscopilea">H. s. fuscopilea</taxonName>, but unfortunately one often finds in the same localities individuals with lighter gray crowns, the latter agreeing closely with <taxonName idx_name="Halcyon senegalensis senegalensis">H. s. senegalensis</taxonName>.  The typical race ranges from the Gambia to northern Cameroon, Khartoum, Abyssinia, western Kenya Colony, the eastern Congo border, the Lower Katanga, and central Angola.  Its home is largely in savannas with gallery forests, but it also inhabits clearings in the northern and eastern parts of the Congo forest, while on the southern border of the forest it is largely replaced by <taxonName idx_name="Halcyon senegalensis fuscopilea">fuscopilea</taxonName>.  In open country from the Transvaal and Damaraland north to southern Angola, the Upper Katanga, inner East Africa, and Eritrea, lives <taxonName idx_name="Halcyon senegalensis cyanoleuca">H. s. cyanoleuca</taxonName>.  This race is the lightest in color, and is best distinguished by a short black line behind the eye in the adult.</p>
				<p>The young of all three races have a black line there, and are apt to be washed with blue on the crown.  This has caused much confusion in the past.  In my synonymies an exact division between <taxonName idx_name="Halcyon senegalensis senegalensis">senegalensis</taxonName> and <taxonName idx_name="Halcyon senegalensis fuscopilea">fuscopilea</taxonName> is impossible, nor can any sharp line be drawn between their ranges.  The wing-length averages slightly less in <taxonName idx_name="Halcyon senegalensis fuscopilea">fuscopilea</taxonName> (94&ndash;101 mm.) than in <taxonName idx_name="Halcyon senegalensis senegalensis">senegalensis</taxonName> (97&ndash;108 mm.), and greatest in <taxonName idx_name="Halcyon senegalensis cyanoleuca">cyanoleuca</taxonName> (107&ndash;112 mm.).</p>
				<p>The behavior and voice of <taxonName idx_name="Halcyon senegalensis senegalensis">senegalensis</taxonName> and <taxonName idx_name="Halcyon senegalensis fuscopilea">fuscopilea</taxonName> are" identical.
<pb n="278" id="t000120-p00284c.tif"/> Throughout the forested lowlands of the Congo this kingfisher is the commonest bird of its family, frequenting the borders of clearings, native plantations, and even the vicinity of dwellings, whether near water or not.  Attention is continually attracted by its loud trilled call, starting with a single high note and then descending the scale.  The whole duration is about a second, and the call may be written &quot;ki&mdash; tir-r-r-r-r-rh!&quot;  In the savanna districts the birds are found about any dense shady woods, small though they be.  They never enter mountain forests, but have been found in the Kivu district as high as 6150 feet.</p>
				<p>Perching usually rather near the ground, they drop upon their insect prey with a sudden dash, return to a tree, and often beat their victim against a bough before attempting to swallow it.  Two birds will approach each other and give a duet, of repeated calls, as they sit with body erect and wings half spread.</p>
				<p>Most of our adult specimens were non-breeding, and nesting seems to be carried on during the rains.  At Medje on September 3, I watched a Senegal kingfisher carrying food into a hole probably excavated by <taxonName>Gymnobucco bonapartei</taxonName> in a tall tree.  The nestlings from Niangara were taken by a native from a similar cavity; and Reichenow, in the Cameroon, found a nest in a tree occupied also by several pairs of <taxonName>Gymnobucco</taxonName>.  This must be the normal manner of nesting in the Congo, even though nests in tunnels in banks have been reported from Bornu, and in arboreal termite nests in the Gold Coast.  No measurements of eggs are available.</p>
				<p>Seven stomach examinations disclosed nothing but insects: 4 large mantises, 2 grasshoppers, several beetles, and one dragon-fly.  It is probable that small lizards and frogs are occasionally eaten, but I doubt if this kingfisher ever fishes.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;Zululand and the Transvaal to southern Angola, Nyasaland, and the Upper Katanga; then northward through the interior of eastern Africa to the upper White Nile and Eritrea.</p>
				<p>All the earlier records from the Congo are doubtful or erroneous, referring usually to the young of the other races, which have a black line behind the eye.  Immaturity is easily recognized by the dark color of the mandible and the heavy vermiculation of the chest.</p>
				<p>We now know that <taxonName idx_name="Halcyon senegalensis cyanoleuca">cyanoleuca</taxonName> occurs in Congo territory in the Upper Katanga, possibly also in the Marungu highland, and even in Ruanda.  The Congo Museum has a very large series of <taxonName idx_name="Halcyon senegalensis">H. senegalensis</taxonName> from all parts of the Belgian colony, but the only specimens agreeing completely with <taxonName idx_name="Halcyon senegalensis cyanoleuca">cyanoleuca</taxonName> are from Kiambi on the Luvua River, Elisabethville, Kasenga, and Kakyelo on the Luombwa River.  Those from Lukafu and Kilwa are closer to <taxonName idx_name="Halcyon senegalensis senegalensis">senegalensis</taxonName> in color, though rather long-winged.  A single skin from Rwaza in Ruanda, another from Kaniki, near Lake Edward, are intermediate in color and wing-length
<pb n="280" id="t000120-p00286c.tif"/> between <taxonName idx_name="Halcyon senegalensis senegalensis">senegalensis</taxonName> and <taxonName idx_name="Halcyon senegalensis cyanoleuca">cyanoleuca</taxonName>.  I have also seen one skin of <taxonName idx_name="Halcyon senegalensis cyanoleuca">cyanoleuca</taxonName> from Butiaba on the east shore of Lake Albert, and it is supposed to reach the upper White Nile.  Specimens from the more wooded parts of Uganda are, however, typical <taxonName idx_name="Halcyon senegalensis senegalensis">senegalensis</taxonName>.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;Senegal to Uganda and Angola. The six races are distinguished by the color of the crown, the shade of blue on the other parts, and size.  The distinctions are best explained by Bannerman (1933).</p>
				<p><taxon><taxonName idx_name="Halcyon malimbica fortis">H. m. fortis</taxonName> Reichenow</taxon> is restricted to Senegal, <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Halcyon malimbica torquata">H. m. torquata</taxonName> Swainson</taxon> to the Gambia and Portuguese Guinea, <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Halcyon malimbica forbesi">H. m. forbesi</taxonName> Sharpe</taxon> ranges from French Guinea or Sierra Leone to Nigeria and the base of Mt. Cameroon.  <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Halcyon malimbica dryas">H. m. dryas</taxonName> Hartlaub</taxon> occupies Fernando Po, S&atilde;o Tom&eacute;, and Princes Island.  <taxonName idx_name="Halcyon malimbica malimbica">H. m. malimbica</taxonName> extends from southern Cameroon to southern Angola,<note n="1">Menegaux and Berlioz, 1923, `Mission Rohan-Chabot,' Ois., p. 19 [125].</note> intergrading in the Upper Congo with <taxonName idx_name="Halcyon malimbica prenticei">H. m. prenticei</taxonName>, while the latter reaches the southern Bahr-el-Ghazal Province, Uganda, and supposedly the Manyema district.</p>
				<p>Only the last two subspecies occur in the Belgian Congo, and they are not easy to tell apart.  The crown in both is gray overlaid with bluish, but the blue areas on body, wings, and tail are a trifle duller or more greenish blue in <taxonName idx_name="Halcyon malimbica prenticei">prenticei</taxonName>; and while the wings in <taxonName idx_name="Halcyon malimbica malimbica">malimbica</taxonName>, when adult, measure 107&ndash;114 mm., those of adults of <taxonName idx_name="Halcyon malimbica prenticei">prenticei</taxonName> vary from 111 to 119 mm.</p>
				<p>It is not a simple matter, therefore, to say just where in the Upper Congo <taxonName idx_name="Halcyon malimbica malimbica">malimbica</taxonName> gives way to <taxonName idx_name="Halcyon malimbica prenticei">prenticei</taxonName>.  Dr. Schouteden&apos;s specimens from Buta and Titule are best referred to <taxonName idx_name="Halcyon malimbica malimbica">malimbica</taxonName>, and so are two collected at Luluabourg by Father Callewaert.  My specimen from Banalia, on the other hand, seems a little closer to <taxonName idx_name="Halcyon malimbica prenticei">prenticei</taxonName>, indicating
<pb n="281" id="t000120-p00287c.tif"/> that the line of separation lies in about that longitude.  The habits and voice are exactly the same, as I know from personal experience.</p>

				<p>SPECIMENS.&mdash;Banalia, &male;, Sept. 26.  Avakubi, &male;, June 2.  Niangara, &male; Jan. 7; 3 &female;, June 1, 10, 15.  Dungu, &female;, Jan. 23.  Faradje, &female;, Apr. 26.</p>
				<p>ADULTS.&mdash;Iris dark brown; maxilla scarlet, but dark brown at very tip and along lower edge and black at sides of base, mandible black; softer skin of feet red, with larger scales and claws dark brown.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;Eastern Congo forest, gallery forests of the Uelle and of the country near lakes Albert and Edward, south to the vicinity of Rutshuru; probably also in the gallery forests of the Manyema, and possibly south to the lowlands near Bukama.  Likewise in the forest areas of Uganda, and on the Sesse Islands.  Our skins from the Upper Uelle do not differ appreciably from the type.</p>
				<p>This is unquestionably one of the most difficult of the wood-kingfishers to collect, and it may seem to be a very rare bird until its voice is recognized.  Then one finds that it is really not uncommon, both in the heavy forest and in the woods along streams in open country.  Its call may be compared with that of <taxonName>Halcyon senegalensis</taxonName>; but <taxonName idx_name="Halcyon malimbica">H. malimbica</taxonName>, instead of trilling, separates its four to six high-pitched syllables. The first note is highest, the others progressively lower.  Thus they are louder, more whistled, and uttered more slowly.  The bird calls usually from a perch, sometimes during flight.  Heard most often in the very early morning, these calls seem not altogether peculiar to the male, for I once shot a female that had given them.</p>
				<p>The extreme wariness of this kingfisher and its fondness for the tallest trees enable it to elude observation with ease.  Even in the heavy forest the blue-breasted kingfisher seems to be fond of the vicinity of streams.  Several times I have come upon single individuals perching low over forest brooks, where they doubtless capture small amphibia.</p>
				<pb n="282" id="t000120-p00288c.tif"/>
				<p>Concerning the nesting of the species I could learn nothing.  I supposed, like Bates, that it must use holes in trees.  Recently, however, two nests of <taxonName idx_name="Halcyon malimbica forbesi">H. m. forbesi</taxonName> have been discovered in arboreal termite nests, in Nigeria and the Gold Coast.  That race lays three to four glossy white eggs, about 28.5 &times; 26.7 mm.</p>
				<p>This is one of the few wood-kingfishers in Africa that regularly take vertebrate prey.  In five stomachs we noted one small frog, a young toad, and bones of two other small amphibians.  Four of the stomachs also held remains of insects, with a single spider.  The insects included beetles, a grasshopper, and winged termites, the latter completely filling one stomach.  In the Cameroon Bates found that <taxonName idx_name="Halcyon malimbica malimbica">H. m. malimbica</taxonName> was sometimes attracted by a column of driver ants, and Sj&ouml;stedt noted that <taxonName idx_name="Halcyon malimbica forbesi">H. m. forbesi</taxonName> preyed on the amphibious fish <taxonName>Periophthalmus</taxonName> among the mangroves.</p>

				<p>SPECIMEN.&mdash;Ngayu, &male;, July 24.</p>
				<p>ADULT MALE.&mdash;Iris dark brown; bill and feet vermilion, with a blackish mark on the upper side of the maxilla, toward its base.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;West Africa from Fanti to the Gaboon, and eastward through the equatorial lowland forest to the Ituri and Mabira in Uganda.  On the south it has been found at Kunungu, Lukolela, Luebo, Luluabourg, 40 miles north of Tshikapa, Lonkala, and Ponthierville.  Though inhabiting gallery forests in the Kasai, it has not yet been found in those of the Uelle, nor is it known from the Mayombe, despite the remark by Bannerman (1930).</p>
				<p><taxon><taxonName idx_name="Myioceyx lecontei ugand&aelig;">M. l. ugand&aelig;</taxonName> van Someren</taxon><note n="1">1921, B. B. O. C., XLI, p. 105 (Budongo Forest).</note> supposedly restricted to the isolated forests of Uganda, seems to me doubtfully valid.  The type has pronounced
<pb n="283" id="t000120-p00289c.tif"/> blue spots on the head, but perhaps this is only a sexual character.<note n="1">See, however, van Someren, 1932, Nov. Zool., XXXVII, p. 289.</note>
				</p>
				<p>Though never found outside forests, this tiny flat-billed kingfisher seems not to prefer the absolutely virgin forest.  The few that I saw myself were in places that either were being cleared or had previously been chopped over and were now badly grown up again.  There they could easily make their escape.  Besides two individuals seen near Medje, I found a pair in a recent clearing between Ngayu and the Ituri River, well away from water.  They were perching on the dry branches of a fallen tree, and these birds seem always to keep close to the ground.</p>

				<p>At first one is apt to confuse them with <taxonName>Ispidina picta</taxonName>, but they live in far more shady places, and are nowhere common.  Yet at Lukolela in 1930 a native hunter secured six specimens for me within three months. Three females taken there on September 18 and November 5 were in breeding condition, so they lay during the first half of the rains.  In the Cameroon Bates saw three of its small white eggs taken from a very short tunnel in the side of a pit.</p>
				<p>I have now examined the contents of four stomachs, all of which contained only insects.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;Senegal and Eritrea south to Natal and Pondoland.  Typical <taxonName idx_name="Ispidina picta picta">picta</taxonName> occupies the northern part of the range, from the Sudanese belt through the equatorial lowlands to Angola, the Katanga, and the coast of Kenya Colony.  <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Ispidina picta jubaensis">I. p. jubaensis</taxonName> van Someren</taxon>,<note n="1">1931, Journ. E. Afr. Ug. N. H. Soc., No. 37, p. 193 (Serenli).</note> known only from the middle Juba River in southern Somaliland, differs in having shorter wings, 43&ndash;50 mm.  Those of <taxonName idx_name="Ispidina picta picta">picta</taxonName> measure 48&ndash;57 mm.  <taxonName idx_name="Ispidina picta natalensis">I. p. natalensis</taxonName> of southeastern Africa differs from <taxonName idx_name="Ispidina picta picta">picta</taxonName> when adult in having a small patch of deep blue feathers just above the whitish spot behind the ear.  Its wings measure 52&ndash;57 mm.  This race extends northward to Northern Rhodesia, the vicinity of Dar-es-Salaam, and apparently to the Kivu highlands.</p>
				<p>The typical race of the pygmy kingfisher is found in every part of the Congo save the mountains rising above 5000 feet and, it seems probable, the highlands of the Kivu and Upper Katanga.  While seen occasionally close to streams and even nesting in river banks, it is really a land kingfisher, which I have never seen dive in the water.  In savanna country it is seen far out in the dry bush, though more commonly
<pb n="285" id="t000120-p00291c.tif"/> in shady spots about the borders of villages.  In dense virgin forest it is never encountered, yet it occurs commonly throughout the forest belt in clearings and in open spots near river banks.</p>
				<p>This gleaming blue-backed sprite of a bird, with disproportionate red bill, prefers a low perch in the shade.  From time to time it raises and lowers its head nervously, and may give a single sharp chirp or &quot;chip,&quot; uttered also in flight.  I have never seen it catch insects in the air, they are usually picked up from the ground.</p>
				<p>Earthen banks of almost any description serve as nesting sites, whether along rivers or far from water, as in game-pits or even the burrows of ant-bears.  Near the equator nesting may continue throughout the year, but to the north it probably takes place from March to May or June.  In the south, likewise, it is to be expected in the early part of the rains.  Tunnels are drilled of very small bore, only 18 or 20 inches long, with enlarged terminal chamber.  A nest at Faradje on March 4 contained three white eggs, one of them 16.2 &times; 14.3 mm.  Bates has given measurements up to 19 &times; 15.5 mm.</p>
				<p>Eight stomachs contained only insects, including grasshoppers, and (in one case) 3 of the crustaceans known as &quot;pill-bugs.&quot;  Bates has noted also spiders and a few small frogs.</p>

				<p>Care must always be taken with the young of <taxonName idx_name="Ispidina picta picta">I. p. picta</taxonName>, which are bluer on the cheeks than adults.

				<p>SPECIMEN.&mdash;Avakubi, &female;, Nov. 3.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;Forests from Portuguese Guinea to the Ituri River, and south to northern Angola and Lake Leopold II. Four subspecies are known.  <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Corythornis leucogaster leucogaster">C. l. leucogaster</taxonName> (Fraser)</taxon> of Fernando Po and <taxonName idx_name="Corythornis leucogaster batesi">C. l. batesi</taxonName> of the mainland in southern Cameroon, Gaboon, and northern Angola, have a rather large patch of rufous at each side of the forehead, as well as a rufous supercilium usually glossed with lilac.  But the insular race has a slightly longer wing and distinctly thicker bill than <taxonName idx_name="Corythornis leucogaster batesi">batesi</taxonName>.  In <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Corythornis leucogaster bowdleri">C. l. bowdleri</taxonName> (Neumann)</taxon> of Upper Guinea, from the Gold Coast to Portuguese Guinea, the rufous of forehead and sides of head is still more extensive, leaving only the middle of the crown black barred
<pb n="287" id="t000120-p00293c.tif"/> with blue.  The opposite extreme of coloration is seen in <taxonName idx_name="Corythornis leucogaster leopoldi">C. l. leopoldi</taxonName>, where only the loral region is rufous, the supercilium and temporal region deep blue.  The blue bars on the crown-feathers are narrower and of a lighter, more greenish blue than in the other races.</p>
				<p>Dubois&apos;s type was plainly immature, with a dark-colored bill; but even adults of <taxonName idx_name="Corythornis leucogaster leopoldi">leopoldi</taxonName>, such as ours from Avakubi, seem to have the bills largely dark brown, not wholly red as in <taxonName idx_name="Corythornis leucogaster batesi">batesi</taxonName> and the other western races.  From the compressed form of the bill it is clear that the present species does not belong in <taxonName>Ispidina</taxonName>, and I prefer not to unite <taxonName>Corythornis</taxonName> with <taxonName>Alcedo</taxonName>, as Professor Neumann (1908) and Dr. Laubmann<note n="1">1924, Archiv f. Naturg., LXXXIX, Abt. A, pp. 190&ndash;196.</note> have done.  It is certainly superfluous to recognize <taxon><taxonName>Ispidella</taxonName> Mathews</taxon><note n="2">1918, `Birds of Australia,' VII, p. 97.</note> for this one species.</p>
				<p>The range of <taxonName idx_name="Corythornis leucogaster leopoldi">leopoldi</taxonName> probably includes most of the forest of the Upper Congo, but so far very few specimens have been obtained, from the middle Congo to the Ituri.  Our single example&mdash;the only one seen&mdash; was found along a small forest brook.  I do not know why it was never encountered along the heavily forested banks of the Ituri or Aruwimi, although Dr. Schouteden believes he saw it on the Itimbiri. It may be of interest to add that in this region of dense woodland, unbroken save for the clearings of man, <taxonName>Corythornis cristata</taxonName> is extremely rare even along the banks of large rivers.</p>
				<p>In August, 1930, a native at Lukolela brought me the flat skin of an adult which he had captured but a day or two before.  Prolonged search failed to reveal any more.  Whitman&apos;s example from Bumba was seen to fly up from the river bank into a shop, where it was captured.</p>
				<p>In its ways of life this kingfisher no doubt resembles <taxonName idx_name="Corythornis cristata">C. cristata</taxonName>, though living exclusively along water in the heavy forest.  It seems to be a very rare bird everywhere.</p>

				<p>As Grote<note n="2">1932, O.

Transvaal Mus., XV, p. 25 (Kabulabula, Chobe R.) seems uncertain.</note>  In the Congo the shortest-winged birds (52.5&ndash;53 mm.) are found near Lukolela and Eala, the longest-winged (58&ndash;61 mm.) in the highlands of the Kivu and

				<p>The malachite kingfisher is extremely rare in the forested southern Cameroon and in the central Ituri forest.  Along the Ituri and Aruwimi rivers, from Penge to Banalia, I noted it only once, at Avakubi.  Along the forested section of the Congo River it is rather frequent; and in all the savanna districts it is common near water, even up to 6500 feet in the Kivu.  A favorite perch is a twig or a reed directly over the water, from which it can dive suddenly with a splash as diminutive as itself, or fly off low over the water with fast-beating wings.  It has the same habit as <taxonName>Ispidina</taxonName> of raising its head with a slight jerk.  One seldom sees the crest erected save in wounded birds.  Instead of rising in the median plane it is spread into a circular tuft, some feathers at the sides of the forehead even pointing forward over the nostrils.</p>
				<pb n="290" id="t000120-p00296u.tif"/>
				<p>In the savanna districts breeding probably takes place during the rains.  At Bumba on July 29 I found a nesting-tunnel about two feet in length, in the side of a small ditch.  The white eggs of this kingfisher are known to number four to six, and measurements have been given as 18.5&ndash;19.3 mm. &times; 14.9&ndash;15.5.</p>
				<p><taxonName>Corythornis cristata</taxonName> occasionally eats small frogs and fish; but in the six stomachs I examined there were only pieces of fresh-water shrimps or prawns, in four instances, and bits of beetles and a grasshopper, in the other two.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;From the Gambia to Uganda and northern Angola.  <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Alcedo quadribrachys quadribrachys">A. q. quadribrachys</taxonName> Bonaparte</taxon> inhabits forested Upper Guinea, and is replaced by <taxonName idx_name="Alcedo quadribrachys guentheri">A. q. guentheri</taxonName> from Southern Nigeria eastward to the Upper Uelle district, Entebbe in Uganda, Lake Edward, and no doubt the Manyema district.  On the south this latter race reaches the Lower Congo, the Kwango River in Angola, the southern Kasai, and the vicinity of Lake Kisale.  The Lower Guinea race is distinguished by the cobalt blue, instead of violet blue, on its back and rump.</p>
				<p>Though primarily a forest bird, <taxonName idx_name="Alcedo quadribrachys guentheri">A. q. guentheri</taxonName> ranges far out along rivers or brooks in gallery forests.  It is not uncommon throughout the forest belt, including the Mayombe, and I have found it at Boma.  I was surprised to see one in a vast papyrus marsh at Kiyuyu on the Lualaba River, in August, 1927.  A canoc-traveler on rivers like the Ituri may expect to encounter one or two almost every day, though they are not conspicuous, perching rather on low branches over the water shielded by foliage.  Their call, rarely heard, is a fine chirp or peep.  They do not hesitate to follow the smaller watercourses far into the virgin forest, and live there along brooks only a few yards wide.</p>
				<p>At Avakubi, a little north of the equator, dissections indicated a short breeding season, beginning toward October when the streams were high.  Nests are in tunnels dug in shady banks near water.  A female was trapped at Avakubi on October 4 in her unfinished home.  The eggs seem to be unknown; but a brood of five young was obtained by Bates in southern Cameroon in December.  A single nestling would produce a continuous &quot;fizzling&quot; sound; and when it was removed, another always began to make the same noise.</p>
				<p>Of seven stomachs examined by me, one was empty, six held single small fish or fish-bones, and two of these also contained pieces of small crabs.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;The half-collared kingfisher ranges from Cape Province north to Damaraland and Angola, and through eastern Africa to Abyssinia.  Laubmann<note n="1">1925, Anz. Orn. Ges. Bayern, No. 9, p. 74.</note> claimed that Abyssinian
<pb n="292" id="t000120-p00298c.tif"/> specimens had wings averaging 86 mm. in length, those of southern Africa only 80.6.  His Abyssinian form, <taxonName idx_name="Alcedo semitorquata heuglini">A. s. heuglini</taxonName>, seems however not to be tenable.</p>
				<p>This kingfisher was known to reach the Urungu district of Tanganyika Territory, near the southern end of Lake Tanganyika, and then was discovered in the Upper Katanga by De Riemaecker.  Additional specimens have been taken by de Witte at Kakyelo on the Luombwa R., and at the confluence of that river with the Luapula.  Their wings measure 84 and 86 mm.</p>
				<p>There is a possibility that the species will be found in the Kivu district or Ruanda.  At Lake Bunyoni, for instance, I saw a kingfisher flying over which seemed to be <taxonName idx_name="Alcedo semitorquata">semitorquata</taxonName>; and this highland lake is not far beyond the Congo border.</p>
				<p>In South Africa the half-collared kingfisher frequents the edges of rivers, where it nests in October and November in tunnels in the banks and lays three or four glossy white eggs, 22.8&ndash;25.4 mm. &times; 19.8&ndash;20.3.</p>

				<p>ADULTS.&mdash;Iris dark brown, bill and feet black.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;Africa to southern China.  <taxonName idx_name="Ceryle rudis rudis">C. r. rudis</taxonName> occupies all Africa south of the Sahara, Egypt, Syria, and Asia Minor, thence eastward to the Persian Gulf.  <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Ceryle rudis leucomelanura">C. r. leucomelanura</taxonName> Reichenbach</taxon> continues the range to India, Ceylon, and perhaps Siam; and <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Ceryle rudis insignis">C. r. insignis</taxonName> Hartert</taxon>, to Hainan and southern China.</p>
				<p>Females of this kingfisher never show the second, narrower breast-band; but it may be lacking also in some males, presumably immature.<note n="1">See Miller, 1912, Bull. A. M. N. H., XXXI, p. 302.</note>
				</p>
				<p>The pied kingfisher extends over the entire area of the Congo, wherever there are fair-sized rivers or lakes, except in the forested highlands. In more open countries it occurs up to 6500 feet in the eastern Congo, or 7500 feet in Abyssinia.  It is not common on the lesser rivers in the forest belt; on the Ituri I saw few, never more than a pair, and only in April, May, and September.  They may not breed there.  On the Congo River, and most streams and lakes in the savannas, this characteristic bird is seen frequently, perching along the shore, hovering over the water, or diving for fish.  The voice is rather weak, a rattle or dry chirping sound, very unlike that of <taxonName>Megaceryle maxima</taxonName>.</p>
				<p>The method of hovering over the same spot is different from that of kestrels.  Instead of flapping against the wind, it holds the axis of the body so nearly vertical that gravity alone keeps it stationary.  Meanwhile the head is bent forward and the bird watches the water below.<note n="2">See diagrams in Hankin, 1913, `Animal Flight,' pp. 152-155.</note>
				</p>
				<p>About the lakes of the eastern Congo considerable numbers are sometimes seen together.  As many as forty or fifty pairs may nest in one place, and a bank only a foot high may furnish a suitable site for excavating their tunnels, 3 to 10 feet long.  The white eggs number four to six, 26&ndash;30 mm. &times; 21&ndash;24.</p>

				<p>SPECIMEN.&mdash;Dungu, &male;, June 5.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;From the Gambia, Sudan, and Abyssinia to the Cape.  Almost the whole of this area is occupied by <taxonName idx_name="Megaceryle maxima maxima">M. m. maxima</taxonName>, with conspicuous white spots on crown and back.  But in forested Upper and Lower Guinea, and some adjacent regions, the majority of birds are darker above, with much finer spotting, and the middle of the upper back often unspotted.  These dark birds constitute a valid race, <taxonName idx_name="Megaceryle maxima gigantea">M. m. gigantea</taxonName>, although in the border regions they may be found together with <taxonName idx_name="Megaceryle maxima maxima">maxima</taxonName>.</p>
				<p>In the Congo the species is found everywhere, with the exception of the mountains, but <taxonName idx_name="Megaceryle maxima maxima">M. m. maxima</taxonName> is relatively rare except in the Katanga and perhaps along the eastern border.  Only one of our specimens from the Upper Uelle can be referred to that race; and of the Congo specimens in Tervueren only a small minority are sufficiently spotted for <taxonName idx_name="Megaceryle maxima maxima">maxima</taxonName>.  They come from Bukama and Lukafu.  I have seen one skin of <taxonName idx_name="Megaceryle maxima maxima">maxima</taxonName> from Nyanza on Lake Tanganyika; but most specimens from Lake Kivu and Lake Edward are closer to <taxonName idx_name="Megaceryle maxima gigantea">gigantea</taxonName>, though somewhat intermediate.  One from Mahagi Port is unexpectedly dark.</p>
				<p>In view of these facts, no attempt to arrange synonymies can be successful without examination of every specimen.  Further details of distribution and habits will be found under the following subspecies.<note n="1">For plumages see Laubmann, 1929, J. f. O., Festschr. E. Hartert, pp. 83&ndash;92.</note>

				<p>ADULTS.&mdash;Iris dark brown; bill black (often gray beneath base of mandible); feet blackish with upper portion, near tarsal joint, grayish green.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;Rather rare in forested Upper Guinea, though occurring in Liberia; common and widely distributed in Lower Guinea, from the Benue River east to Lake Albert, Lake Kivu, and Baraka on Lake Tanganyika.  Its limit on the south is not well known, but may be expected to include the Kasai district and northern Angola.  Within the borders of its range specimens of <taxonName idx_name="Megaceryle maxima maxima">maxima</taxonName> are also found, as well as intermediate examples.  Swainson&apos;s figure and description both fit this darker form, and many of his &quot;Senegal&quot; birds do not occur there. Having myself examined a specimen of <taxonName idx_name="Megaceryle maxima gigantea">gigantea</taxonName> from the Dukwia River, Liberia, I see no need to use the name <taxonName idx_name="Megaceryle maxima sharpii">sharpii</taxonName> of Gould.</p>
				<p><taxonName idx_name="Megaceryle maxima gigantea">M. m. gigantea</taxonName> is not restricted to the region of solid forest, for it is common in the Upper Uelle and beyond the southern edge of the forest belt.  Specimens from Lake Kivu are a little more spotted than those of the Central Congo, but are mostly not typical <taxonName idx_name="Megaceryle maxima maxima">maxima</taxonName>.  The species has not been found much above 5000 feet in the Kivu.</p>
				<p>This giant kingfisher is not sociable, and frequently attracts attention by flying about high over the trees with a loud complaining &quot;kek-kek-kek-kek&mdash;,&quot; uttered by both sexes.  It perches along the river banks, warily preferring boughs concealed in the foliage.  Even
<pb n="296" id="t000120-p00302c.tif"/> from a canoe it is often hard to see the bird until it flies out low over the stream.  Along heavily forested rivers it is more numerous than <taxonName>Ceryle rudis</taxonName>, and does not hover like that species.</p>
				<p>In the northeastern Congo the breeding season coincides with the drought, when perhaps fishing is easier.  Nests are solitary, in banks near water; and one which I saw at Gamangui in February had its tunnel sloping downward at nearly 45 degrees to a distance of four feet. It contained three young.  A female with ovary enlarged was secured at Faradje on December 6 and a young bird just out of the nest on March 1.  At Bolobo Dr. Schouteden collected two half-grown nestlings on March 24, when the water is still low in the river there.  In southern Africa nesting takes place in August and September.  Eggs of this species are glossy white with very fine pitting, 44&ndash;46 mm. &times; 34.5&ndash; 37.3, in sets of three to five.</p>
				<p>In the stomachs of six individuals I found only fish and their scales and bones, although they are credited elsewhere with eating crabs, frogs, reptiles, insects, and even a centipede.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;Africa south of the Sahara, but not in forests of west and center.  The three subspecies are distinguished by color-characters.  <taxonName idx_name="Dicrocercus hirundineus hirundineus">D. h. hirundineus</taxonName>, with the forehead green, extends from Natal and the Orange River northward to Dar-es-Salaam, the west shore of Lake Tanganyika, and the Cuanza River in Angola. Within our limits it inhabits the southern savannas from the Upper Katanga to the Manyema, the Kasai, and probably the Kwango district.</p>
				<p><taxon><taxonName idx_name="Dicrocercus hirundineus chrysolaimus">D. h. chrysolaimus</taxonName> (Jardine and Selby)</taxon> occupies the savannas of Upper Guinea, from Senegal to northern Cameroon and Lake Chad.<note n="1">A mounted specimen of <taxonName idx_name="Dicrocercus hirundineus chrysolaimus">D. h. chrysolaimus</taxonName>, in the American Museum purchased from Verreaux Fr&egrave;res, is labeled &quot;Gabon&quot;; but the locality is evidently erroneous.  It seems possible that the race may reach the Ubangi district of the Congo.</note> The forehead and a supraloral stripe are light bluish.  In the intermediate region, near the eastern Sudan, lives <taxonName idx_name="Dicrocercus hirundineus heuglini">D. h. heuglini</taxonName>, differing from <taxonName idx_name="Dicrocercus hirundineus chrysolaimus">chrysolaimus</taxonName> mainly in the darker blue of its chest-band and upper tail-coverts.  Young birds of this species have the whole throat greenish and lack the chest-band.</p>
				<p>Neave (1910) noted that <taxonName idx_name="Dicrocercus hirundineus hirundineus">Dicrocercus h. hirundineus</taxonName> in the Upper Katanga frequented the savanna woods.  Though usually solitary, it forms family parties of as many as five in the wet season.  The Congo Museum has specimens also from Kinda, Lake Musolo, and Kabalo. This bee-eater probably nests in the southeastern Congo in the latter part of the dry season, toward August or September.  Nests have been found in Damaraland and in Portuguese East Africa in October. They are horizontal tunnels in soft earthen banks, about three feet long, and contain three or four eggs.  The latter are white and glossy, oval or nearly spherical, measuring 20&ndash;21.3 mm. &times; 18&ndash;19.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;Senegal to Nubia and the Danakil coast, south to Natal, but wanting in the heavy forests of Upper and Lower Guinea.  Four subspecies are recognized.  <taxonName idx_name="Melittophagus pusillus pusillus">M. p. pusillus</taxonName> extends from Senegal to the Lake Chad district, and just along the northern edge of the Lower Guinea forest east to the northern Ituri.  In this race there is usually no blue superciliary line, a narrow one being present in <taxonName idx_name="Melittophagus pusillus ocularis">M. p. ocularis</taxonName> of the eastern Sudan and Uelle.  <taxonName idx_name="Melittophagus pusillus meridionalis">M. p. meridionalis</taxonName> of eastern and southern Africa has a well-marked blue supercilium; and in <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Melittophagus pusillus cyanostictus">M. p. cyanostictus</taxonName> Cabanis</taxon>, from southern Abyssinia and Somaliland to the Pangani River, the blue eyebrow is even more striking.<note n="1">The validity of <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Melittophagus pusillus sharpei">M. p. sharpei</taxonName> Hartert</taxon>, from Somaliland and southern Abyssinia, is doubtful.</note>
				</p>
				<p>In the Congo <taxonName idx_name="Melittophagus pusillus pusillus">M. p. pusillus</taxonName> is apparently confined to the northern edge of the lowland forest, coming into suitable clearings, as at Medje. Our specimens from that locality are certainly not <taxonName idx_name="Melittophagus pusillus ocularis">ocularis</taxonName>, nor are those collected at Buta by Brother Hutsebaut.  The Medje specimens were in breeding condition in January, their feet soiled with red earth.  This
<pb n="300" id="t000120-p00306c.tif"/> is an excellent example of a strictly insectivorous bird nesting in the dry season.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;From Eritrea and Nubia to the Bahr-el-Ghazal and the savannas of the northern Uelle.  The two males from Faradje have a blue line over the posterior part of the eye; it is far less noticeable in the female.  The male from Nzoro looks almost like typical <taxonName idx_name="Melittophagus pusillus pusillus">pusillus</taxonName>.</p>
				<p>From Niangara to Faradje we found it rather common, and especially fond of grassy marshes, where it would perch on the reed stems and circle out in pursuit of flying insects.  Its note is a short weak chirp.</p>
				<p>A young bird in the greenish juvenal plumage was taken in June; and a male in March had the testes somewhat enlarged, its bill being worn at the tip from digging the nest.  We may count the months from March to May perhaps as the breeding season, this being the end of the drought and commencement of rains.  Specimens taken from August to December were certainly in no condition to breed.</p>

				<p>ADULTS.&mdash;Iris bright red, bill and feet black.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;Natal and Lake Ngami northward to Dar-es-Salaam, Uganda, and Lake Albert.  On the west coast it reaches Landana, and in the Congo occupies all the southern and eastern savannas north to Kwamouth and Kasongo, the Kivu grasslands, the Semliki Valley, and the savannas west of Lake Albert.</p>
				<p>They do not go in flocks, but about Leopoldville were common enough for a half-dozen to be seen in a few hours' walk.  Not infrequently two will perch side by side on some dry branch, watching intently for insects.  Even though they fly off from five to ten yards, they are apt to return to the same perch to eat their prize.</p>
				<p>Dissection showed that they were breeding at Leopoldville and Kwamouth in July, the southern dry season.  The nests of this bee-eater are small tunnels in banks or in the walls of ant-bear burrows. The glossy white eggs, four or five in number, measure 18.5&ndash;19.8 mm. &times; 15.3&ndash;17.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;Cameroon east to the Kavirondo district, south to Lake Bangweolo, and west to Benguella and the Gaboon coast.  Rare in the area of heavy forest, though occurring in large clearings, as at Bumba and near Coquilhatville.  It lives mainly in the savannas bordering the forest area.</p>
				<p><taxonName idx_name="Melittophagus variegatus variegatus">Melittophagus v. variegatus</taxonName>, usually with only a blue-green line above the eye, or none at all, is restricted mainly to the southern side of the forest belt, and extends from the Gaboon southward to Benguella, and eastward to the Ruzizi Valley.  Its breast-band is deep blue.</p>
				<p><taxon><taxonName idx_name="Melittophagus variegatus loringi">M. v. loringi</taxonName> Mearns</taxon>, with a bluer superciliary line, ranges from Uganda westward to the Cameroon.  Southward this race probably extends to the Kivu highlands, but it differs very slightly from <taxonName idx_name="Melittophagus variegatus variegatus">variegatus</taxonName>.</p>
				<p><taxon><taxonName idx_name="Melittophagus variegatus bangweoloensis">M. v. bangweoloensis</taxonName> Grant</taxon>, without distinct superciliary line, and with blue-black chest-band, is known from Lake Bangweolo, the Katanga, and possibly the middle Kwango River.</p>
				<p>Typical <taxonName idx_name="Melittophagus variegatus variegatus">variegatus</taxonName> seems to be fairly common near the Congo mouth, about Kunungu near Bolobo, and in the northern Kasai.  Thence it extends to the Manyema, Uvira, and the Ruzizi Valley.  Three specimens from near Eala have rather conspicuous bluish eyebrows, while those of the Lower Congo are the dullest and greenest there.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;From the Kavirondo district and Uganda westward through the savannas just north of the Congo forest as far as the Cameroon, also southward along the eastern border of the Congo forest to Rutshuru and Ruanda.  Cameroon specimens have a narrow stripe of blue over the eye, not quite so conspicuous as in those from Uganda. The validity of this race may certainly be debated.  The differences are slight, the birds variable, but in a series of some fifty skins in the Congo Museum those of <taxonName idx_name="Melittophagus variegatus">variegatus</taxonName> from the Lower Congo have very little blue-green on the supercilium.  This strip becomes better marked toward the middle Congo River and Kasai, and specimens from Uvira are hard to distinguish from those taken just north of Lake Kivu.  If a line can be drawn anywhere, it is best placed to the south of that lake.  There is a slight average difference in wing-length, 82&ndash;89.5 mm. in birds from the Lower and Middle Congo, 88&ndash;93 mm. in those I have measured from the Uelle, Lake Edward, and northern Kivu.</p>
				<p>The blue-banded bee-eater is not very common in the northern Congo.  Alexander secured specimens in the vicinity of the upper Kibali River and it does occur here and there, westward to Bangui.  I probably confused it with <taxonName idx_name="Melittophagus pusillus">M. pusillus</taxonName> in life.  But along the western shore of Lake Albert in 1926 I found it common at Kasenyi, especially near the water, perching on tall grass-stalks and darting out in pursuit of insects. It also lives in drier grassy spots near Irumu and Katwe, and was noted at Kasindi Landing, at Luofu, and along the Rutshuru River.  Then at Lake Bunyoni (6700 feet) several were seen along the reedy shores. The white angle at the side of the neck enables one to distinguish it from <taxonName idx_name="Melittophagus pusillus">pusillus</taxonName> in life.  To confuse it with <taxonName idx_name="Melittophagus lafresnayii oreobates">M. l. oreobates</taxonName> would be easy, but from my experience on the slopes of the mountains I feel sure that <taxonName idx_name="Melittophagus variegatus">M. variegatus</taxonName> does not ascend above 5000 feet unless the vegetation is unusually open and grassy.</p>
				<p>Its nesting habits have not been investigated.  At Bumba, Christy obtained two young in complete juvenal dress on June 6, indicating that they breed toward the beginning of the rains.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;From the country east of Lake Bangweolo to the Upper Katanga and probably the southern Lomami district.  The British Museum has an adult female from Nasondoye.  In the Congo Museum there are seven adults and two young from &quot;Katanga,&quot; Biano Plateau, Kando River near Tenke, and Mukula Gombe, as well as one from &quot;Lomami,&quot; which agrees with the others.  A young bird from Dilolo has an incomplete chest-band that seems a little bluer.  Two examples from the middle Kwango River show considerable resemblance to Katanga birds.</p>
				<p><taxonName idx_name="Melittophagus variegatus bangweoloensis">M. v. bangweoloensis</taxonName> is best recognized by its very blackish chest-band and the lack of any bluish supercilium.  The rufous just below the chest-band seems more restricted than in the other races, and the blackish tips of the outer rectrices likewise a little less extensive.  The wings measure 81&ndash;87 mm.  This race is probably not rare in the Katanga, but it is more easily mistaken for <taxonName idx_name="Melittophagus pusillus">M. pusillus</taxonName> than is either of the others.</p>

Occasionally it has been taken as high as 8000 feet on Ruwenzori, but it is more common from 6000 to 7000 feet.  Here it goes in pairs or small parties, perching on thin branches of trees, often dead ones, and flying out after insects.  On the west slope of Ruwenzori 4950 feet was the lowest level at which they were observed.  We found them feeding largely on bees similar to the ordinary honey bee.</p>
				<p>In the mountains northwest of Lake Edward they were found as low as 4350 feet along the Biakobe River.  On the Kivu Volcanoes the species seemed scarce, but it frequented the eucalyptus trees in the post of Kisenyi.  The breeding season apparently commenced in March near Lake Edward, and a young bird in juvenal dress was taken at Kisenyi in July.</p>
				<p>Near Phillipshof, at 5500 feet in the Usambara Mountains, Loveridge<note n="1">1928, P. Z. S. Lond., pp. 73, 74.  See also Peters and Loveridge, 1936, Bull. Mus. Comp. Zo&ouml;l., LXXIX, pp. 165, 166.</note> found nests between December 20 and 30.  They were tunnels in banks, making a sharp turn just before the nest-chamber, two to two and a half feet in.  The eggs were in sets of three, white, but often stained by reddish earth, and measured 22 &times; 18 mm.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;Senegal to Sennar and northern Uganda.  <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Melittophagus bullocki bullocki">M. b. bullocki</taxonName> (Vieillot)</taxon> ranges from Senegal to northern
<pb n="306" id="t000120-p00312c.tif"/> Cameroon and the Shari River, while <taxonName idx_name="Melittophagus bullocki frenatus">M. b. frenatus</taxonName>, with a blue line under the black stripe through the eye region, replaces it to the eastward. Both races live in savannas north of the forest belt, and do not quite reach the edge of the solid forest.  We first saw <taxonName idx_name="Melittophagus bullocki frenatus">frenatus</taxonName> at Niangara, and then found it common along the upper Uelle and Dungu rivers.  It seemed to prefer the vicinity of watercourses, where it found suitable nesting sites and convenient places to hawk for insects. The ordinary call may be written &quot;quip!&quot; or &quot;whip!&quot;; but about the nest or when going to roost it gives several shorter, lower notes, rapidly repeated, &quot;quip-p-p!&quot; At Faradje the species is resident throughout the year.</p>
				<p>Breeding takes place in the dry season, when the rivers are low. At different places on the Dungu River nesting colonies were seen from December to March, inclusive, some with upwards of 80 holes in a steep sandy bank.  Sometimes only a quarter of them contained eggs, in sets of two to four, pure white, 19.6&ndash;21.1 mm. &times; 17&ndash;17.2.  These tunnels were about two feet in length with enlarged terminal chamber; and bee-eaters, like kingfishers, use no nesting material.  Their feet wear two grooves in the floor; and before entering the birds often cling below the entrance, resting on their tails.  Nestlings obtained at Faradje in March had heels with conspicuous swollen pads of translucent yellowish color, upon which they rest practically their whole weight.</p>
				<p>Stomach examinations showed wasps, bees, and other insects.  These included large wasps of the genus <taxonName>Belonogaster</taxonName>, which are beaten against the perch before being swallowed.</p>

				<p>SPECIMEN.&mdash;Boma, &female;, Jan. 24.</p>
				<p>ADULT FEMALE.&mdash;Iris dark brown, bill black, feet blackish.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;From Natal northward to the Mau Escarpment and the Turkwell River in East Africa, the Kivu district, savannas of the Manyema, the Lower Congo, the savannas of the Gaboon, and even Cape Lopez.  In the Congo therefore, it inhabits the southern savannas, coming close to the border of the forest belt, except in the Kasai district.  Reichenow (1902) was mistaken in listing this species from the Ubangi, and it is certainly very rare on the plateaus of the Katanga and Kivu.  The Congo Museum has three skins from Kasenga on the Luapula River.</p>
				<p>The specimen we collected at Boma in January was in non-breeding condition and fresh plumage.  It was one of three perching on a baobab; the species was not abundant there.  A male which I obtained in the Ruzizi Valley on July 18 showed only slight enlargement of the testes, and I believe the breeding season in the southern Congo to be in September. In the Zambesi district Millar collected two sets of four eggs, on October 4.  They were pure white and glossy, 22.6&ndash;24.1 mm. &times; 18.3&ndash;19.8.<note n="1">Chubb, 1914, Ann Durban Mus., I, p. 60.</note>  The nests are in colonies, in tunnels in banks, and have also been found in Southern Rhodesia in September and in Kenya Colony in October.</p>

				<p>The black bee-eater is a fairly common bird in the forests of the Lower and Upper Congo, and extends out farther into the gallery forests on the south than on the north.  I have seen several specimens from Luluabourg.  Nevertheless, it does not live in the depths of the forest, but is found in pairs usually sitting in tall trees near some open spot, partially cleared land, or the border of a plantation.  Thence they fly out in pursuit of passing insects, but do not give any loud call.  Among the insects eaten I noted one dragon-fly.</p>
				<p>Dissections indicated that in the Ituri, just north of the equator, the breeding season lasts only from January to April.  At Lukolela, just south of the equator, on September 19, I saw a bird fly from its nest, a tunnel sloping slightly downward into the base of an old termite hill.  At Basongo, Dr. Schouteden obtained a well-grown nestling on July 19.  In the southern Cameroon Bates<note n="1">1909, Ibis, p. 24; 1927," idem, p. 25.</note> found two nests that were solitary holes in banks, containing two white eggs, 24&ndash;26 mm. &times; 20&ndash;21.</p>

It is not known from the Mayombe.  <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Melittophagus m&uuml;lleri yalensis">M. m. yalensis</taxonName> van Someren</taxon> is supposedly a paler race from Elgon, Suk, and North Kavirondo; but two specimens from Kakamega look to me very like <taxonName idx_name="Melittophagus m&uuml;lleri m&uuml;lleri">m&uuml;lleri</taxonName> from the Ituri.</p>
				<p>This dark-colored bee-eater from the forest region is a little less common than <taxonName idx_name="Melittophagus gularis">M. gularis</taxonName> in the Upper Congo, and likewise almost never found in the undergrowth of virgin forest.  It prefers the edges of small openings in the forest, along roads or at the borders of old clearings. Three was the largest number I ever saw together, and no sound was heard from them.  Rarely observed in the tops of high trees, they usually select lower perches on either dead or leafy branches.  Adults taken at Medje from July to September were non-breeding, and the immature specimens indicate nesting there toward February or March, at the end of the dry period.  In the Cameroon Bates obtained two nestlings from a two-foot tunnel in a bank.</p>

				<p>SPECIMEN.&mdash;Banalia, &female;, Sept. 21.</p>
				<p>ADULT FEMALE.&mdash;Iris bright crimson, bill black, feet dark greenish gray.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;From the northern edge of the forest belt between the Sanga and Ubangi rivers south to the northern Kwango and central Kasai districts; westward to the Ogowe River in the Gaboon, and the coast south to the Congo mouth; eastward to Angu on the Uelle, Buta on the Itimbiri, and Banalia on the Aruwimi.  Still unknown in the Cameroon proper, as it is in the whole eastern borderland of the Congo forest.</p>
				<p>Evidently non-migratory, the species is mainly restricted to rivers. Father Callewaert sent us two males from Kabiseba on the Lulua River, 6&Degree; 30&prime; S.  The Congo Museum contains eight specimens from Buta, and in addition to those recorded by Dr. Schouteden, others from Kiniati in the Mayombe, Kunungu near Bolobo, Mongombo near Lisala, and the Kwilu River.  Neither in the Ituri nor at Lukolela did I see this large black-headed bee-eater.  Nowhere does it seem abundant, and perhaps it escapes observation because it so often perches in the trees along wooded rivers instead of flying out over the water.  I have seen it only twice, first at a village just above Banalia and later on a wooded islet below Stanleyville.  The voice is very weak, not apt to attract attention.  Our specimen had eaten a beetle and a wasp. Wings of thirty-one skins from the Congo measure 117&ndash;125 mm.  The sexes cannot always be distinguished by tail-length.  Our female from Banalia has the attenuate median rectrices 171 mm.  There may be an average difference, for six sexed as males in the Congo Museum have tails 151&ndash;179 mm. (next-to-median rectrices 42&ndash;64 mm. shorter) and five females 145&ndash;155 mm. (other rectrices 32&ndash;41 mm. shorter).  In the juvenal plumage the crown-feathers are very broadly tipped with green.  The nesting habits are unknown, but at Kotili, on January 3, Dr. Schouteden collected a female with an egg in her oviduct.  At that time the river there would be low.  The egg is white, not glossy, and measures 27.2 &times; 22.7 mm.</p>

				<p>ADULTS.&mdash;Iris bright red, bill black, feet light brownish green.</p>
				<p>IMMATURE.&mdash;Iris brownish red, changing to dark brown on outer edge.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;Senegal to Eritrea and southern Arabia, migrating southward to the Upper Guinea coast, Angola, Lake Leopold II, the Kivu district, and Tanganyika Territory to Dar-es-Salaam.</p>
				<p>Specimens of the black-crowned bee-eater from East Africa and Southern Arabia have slightly longer wings than those from West Africa, the longest-winged specimen measuring 108 mm.  The averages, as computed by Sclater and Mackworth-Praed<note n="1">1919, Ibis, p. 662.</note> from 60 specimens evenly
<pb n="312" id="t000120-p00318c.tif"/> distributed as to region, are: northern West Africa, 97.7; Sudan and Uganda, 99.7; northeast Africa and Arabia, 102.7.  Our series of 10 adult males from the Ituri and Uelle gives an average wing-length of 100.25 mm., whereas the average for 8 adult males from the Mayombe, in the Congo Museum, is actually 101 mm.  Friedmann (1930) finds the bill to be longer in eastern birds.  Females have wings some 5 mm. shorter than the males.  While it may be possible to distinguish between typical <taxonName idx_name="Aerops albicollis">albicollis</taxonName>, breeding in the southern Sahara, and <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Aerops albicollis major">A. a. major</taxonName> Parrot</taxon>, breeding in northeastern Africa and southern Arabia, the migrants to the Congo are mostly intermediates, and here the distinction becomes impractical.</p>
				<p>This species nests nowhere in the Congo.  Its old tunnels have been found by Bates in the southern Sahara, and its eggs were taken by Antinori in Abyssinia.  It is a lowland bird, said to breed also near Khartoum and even in northern Kenya Colony.</p>
				<p>Every year these bee-eaters revisit the greater part of the Congo except the southeast, in flocks composed of young and old.  They become common in the Lower and Middle Congo, but seem not to reach the Kasai or Manyema districts.  In the Uelle they make their appearance regularly soon after October 20, and at Avakubi in the Ituri forest were first observed on November 16 and 18 in two different years. There they very soon became numerous, and being fond of the large trees about clearings, were sure to be noticed.  Toward nightfall they go to roost in large flocks, with pleasant twittering notes, composed mainly of a syllable sounding like &quot;kleer&quot; or &quot;k-l-l-leer-r.&quot;  The same calls are heard from birds migrating high overhead.</p>
				<p>During the middle of the dry season they have all deserted the Uelle district for the moister forest to the south.  In April they are still to be seen at Avakubi, and are common at Medje in mid-May.  By the first week in June, however, the last have left the Uelle River.  At Garamba I heard the unmistakable note of the last stragglers on June 12 and 15.  I have seen a specimen collected at Berbera, Somaliland, on April 29, and there are others from the western border of Abyssinia on March 3 and 4.  The breeding season is supposedly from July to September.</p>
				<p>Like all bee-eaters, <taxonName>Aerops albicollis</taxonName> is entirely insectivorous.  We examined five stomachs with such food, and noted winged ants in one of them.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;From Usambara and western Tanganyika Territory south to the lower Shire River and Tete on the Zambesi River. The one published record from Congo territory is that by Mouritz, possibly only a sight" identification.  But Rockefeller and Murphy secured three adult specimens in March, 1929, at Lake Suse, 3850 feet, in southern Marungu.  They report the species as common there.  Two adults were also collected by de Witte at Kakyelo on the Luombwa River.</p>
				<p>Neave met with it only in the Lofu valley, south of Lake Tanganyika. &quot;It has the habits of a <taxonName>Melittophagus</taxonName>,&quot; he wrote,<note n="1">1910, Ibis, p. 113.</note> &quot;rather than of a <taxonName>Merops</taxonName>, making short flights and constantly returning to the same perch.

				<p>ADULTS.&mdash;Iris red, bill black, feet brownish gray.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;Southern Europe and North Africa to central Asia, migrating southward to Cape Province and India.  It is positively known to nest in South Africa, during the southern summer.<note n="1">Sclater, 1903, `Birds S. Afr.,' III, p. 59; Betham, 1927, Ibis, p. 93; Vincent, 1934, Ibis, p. 779.</note>  In most of the Congo area, especially the forest, the European bee-eater has not been reported, though the fact that it has been taken on the lower Congo makes it seem likely that some few individuals migrate across the equatorial forest.  Many more of them, however, go around its eastern end, as proved by the far more numerous records from East Africa and the adjoining Congo border.  In the southeastern Congo the species is fairly common, and there are unpublished records from Tembwe, Kabalo, Kinda, and Nieuwdorp.</p>
				<p>I was at first unable to distinguish <taxonName idx_name="Merops apiaster">M. apiaster</taxonName> and <taxonName idx_name="Merops persicus">M. persicus</taxonName> by their calls, and the general resemblance in size made it difficult to say just how common <taxonName idx_name="Merops apiaster">apiaster</taxonName> was in the Uelle.  Only at Nzoro and Faradje did we" identify it with certainty.  From April 7 to 14, 1912, we found it common near Nzoro, and rather sociable, six or a dozen in a loose flock.  On October 12 and 13 of the same year, many were again observed at Faradje, flying about over the station.  Among the insects eaten by our specimens we noted a cicada.</p>
				<p>From the published records, it would seem that some individuals remain during their winter sojourn as far north as Togoland, Ruwenzori, and Lake Kivu, although the great majority pass on farther to the south.  On January 15, 1927, at the south end of the Ruwenzori Range I shot a female, and on February 12 saw another example on the Semliki River near Beni.  In the highlands west of Lake Edward they were common in March, flocks of as many as 30 being noted.  Here there was a chance to compare their notes with those of <taxonName idx_name="Merops persicus">M. persicus</taxonName>, and the
<pb n="315" id="t000120-p00321c.tif"/> latter proved to be recognizably hoarser.  Our last specimen of <taxonName idx_name="Merops apiaster">apiaster</taxonName> was taken at Rutshuru on April 1.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;Southern Algeria to northwest India, migrating into Africa.  <taxonName idx_name="Merops persicus persicus">M. p. persicus</taxonName> breeds from the Caspian Sea and Persia to Palestine, Egypt, Baluchistan, and northwest India. It migrates through northeastern Africa, crosses the whole of the Congo and reaches Cape Province.  <taxonName idx_name="Merops persicus chrysocercus">M. p. chrysocercus</taxonName>, differing from <taxonName idx_name="Merops persicus persicus">persicus</taxonName> by the more golden sheen of its upperparts and by the longer tips of its median rectrices, breeds from southern Tunisia to Morocco, as well as near Lake Chad.  It migrates to Senegal, Sierra Leone, S&atilde;o Tom&eacute;, and the Cameroon.  In adult males of <taxonName idx_name="Merops persicus persicus">persicus</taxonName> the median rectrices usually exceed the others by 45&ndash;65 mm., and in <taxonName idx_name="Merops persicus chrysocercus">chrysocercus</taxonName> by 70&ndash;115 mm.</p>
				<p>It may be that <taxonName idx_name="Merops persicus persicus">persicus</taxonName> does not visit Upper Guinea, but it certainly does occur commonly even in the Lower Congo.  At Malela in December and January Lance collected four adult males with tail-tips of
<pb n="316" id="t000120-p00322c.tif"/> average dimensions for <taxonName idx_name="Merops persicus persicus">persicus</taxonName>; and I have seen other adults of <taxonName idx_name="Merops persicus persicus">persicus</taxonName> from Kidada, Leopoldville, Bolobo, and Lake Leopold.  All specimens from the eastern Congo belong to this same race.</p>
				<p>These large green bee-eaters do not winter in any great numbers in the Ituri forest, and in the Uelle they are still more strictly birds of passage.  In both districts they are commonly observed, often in large flocks, in September and October and again from the middle of March through April.  The earliest date of arrival at Faradje was September 3, and at Avakubi September 16.  At Faradje they were last seen on April 27 in the spring of 1911.  An exceptional female was collected at Garamba in early July.</p>
				<p>About Lake Edward, and from there to the eastern Katanga, these birds winter in numbers; yet none seem to have been collected in the Kasai district.  I have seen specimens from the Sankuru district, Katobwe on the Lualaba, Kilwa on Lake Moero, and the Luombwa River.  The calls of <taxonName idx_name="Merops apiaster">M. apiaster</taxonName> and <taxonName idx_name="Merops persicus">M. persicus</taxonName> are very similar, and may be written &quot;kweer!&quot; though often rolled toward the end, &quot;kweer-r-r-r!&quot;  That of <taxonName idx_name="Merops apiaster">apiaster</taxonName> is more resonant and pleasing, that of <taxonName idx_name="Merops persicus">persicus</taxonName> hoarser.</p>
				<p>In the eastern Congo savannas <taxonName idx_name="Merops persicus persicus">Merops p. persicus</taxonName> takes its departure about the first of April.  A few weeks later <taxonName idx_name="Merops superciliosus">M. superciliosus</taxonName> arrives from the southward, to remain almost until the return of <taxonName idx_name="Merops persicus">persicus</taxonName> from the north.</p>
				<p>Four stomachs of <taxonName idx_name="Merops persicus persicus">persicus</taxonName> were examined; and among the insects they contained we noted dragon-flies in two cases and winged termites once.  The latter were being captured by a flock of bee-eaters at sunset, during their nuptial flight.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;Madagascar, Cormoro Islands, and eastern Africa from Portuguese East Africa northward to Eritrea, Lake Albert, and the Manyema district, west to southern Angola.  This bee-eater is known to breed in Madagascar, on Pemba Island, and near Beira, on the mainland.  In the eastern Congo it is clearly a migrant, spending its off-season there.  I have supposed that birds found in the Congo came from Madagascar, but it is possible that they are those of the southeastern coast.</p>
				<p><taxonName idx_name="Merops superciliosus">M. superciliosus</taxonName> is so closely allied to <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Merops philippinus">M. philippinus</taxonName> Linn&aelig;us</taxon> of the Oriental Region and to <taxonName idx_name="Merops persicus">M. persicus</taxonName> that many authorities regard them as races of one species.</p>
				<p>The Madagascar bee-eater has been found in the Congo only in savanna countries from Lake Upemba and Lake Tanganyika to the Manyema, the Kivu district, and Lake Albert.  I first saw it at Entebbe, Uganda, on July 21, then at Butiaba on August 9.  At Kasenyi the species was numerous until early September, perching in the tops of the larger trees and flying gracefully in pursuit of insects.  The voice is similar to that of <taxonName idx_name="Merops persicus">persicus</taxonName>.</p>
				<p>So partial is this bird to lake shores that I never saw it above the escarpment to the west of Lake Albert.  Specimens all proved to be non-breeding, and by September 10 no more were to be seen.  It was not until May 16 of the next year, at Rutshuru, that <taxonName idx_name="Merops superciliosus">superciliosus</taxonName> reappeared.</p>
				<p>Adults were now in fresh plumage, molting their primaries, with gonads reduced.  They soon became numerous, and it was clear that they had just returned from their breeding grounds.  At Uvira on July 23, I counted eight, and collected a non-breeding male, still molting its outermost primaries.</p>

				<p>SPECIMENS.&mdash;Coquilhatville, &male;, Dec. 16.  Near Monsembe, on upper Congo, 3 &male;, 5 &female;, July 22.</p>
				<p>ADULTS.&mdash;Iris bright crimson, bill black, feet dusky brown.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;Gold Coast Colony to northern and southern Nigeria, the Gaboon, Lower Congo, northern Kwango and Kasai districts, and the upper Congo to lower Itimbiri River and Basoko.  It must occur on the lower Ubangi River, though Dybowski&apos;s specimen was not taken there; and none has been collected on the Aruwimi River. Unpublished localities from specimens in the Congo Museum are Dima, Lisala, Moenge, Barumbu, and Elisabetha.</p>
				<p>The lack of a Cameroon record, thus far, shows that it is not a true forest bird.  All the localities where it has been taken are in savannas or along sea-coasts or wide rivers.  In ascending the Congo River, in July 1909, we first noticed this rosy-breasted bee-eater a little way above Kwamouth, and from there to the neighborhood of Monsembe we saw a few, at least, almost every day.  They fly about gracefully over the water, dipping occasionally in it as swallows do.  One evening at the village of Malele, near Monsembe, we found a flock of fully 175 sitting in the top of a large dead tree near the river bank.  Of eight specimens secured on this occasion, every one had its gizzard well filled with large brown winged ants.</p>
				<p>During my return trip down the Congo from Stanleyville in December, 1914, <taxonName>Merops malimbicus</taxonName> was seen commonly in flocks of 30 or more from Bumba to Kunzulu, just below Kwamouth.  The call-note
<pb n="319" id="t000120-p00325c.tif"/> has bee-eater characteristics, but is unusually hoarse and sounds to my ear like &quot;chick-k.&quot;</p>
				<p>Specimens taken by me on the Congo River between Lukolela and Monsembe in July, August, September, and December were all non-breeding.  The behavior of the birds about shelving sand-bars during the low-water period from February to early April left no doubt that this was their breeding season.  Examples in juvenal plumage are surprisingly few.  One was taken at Lukolela as late as August 10; it must have been hatched about four months earlier, unless possibly a few pairs nest in July.  Certainly this bee-eater is not migratory on the upper Congo River, but along the coast it may be.  In the Fernand Vaz district of the Gaboon they are seen especially from September 15 to November, Aschemeier told me<note n="1">Maclatchy, 1937, Ois. R. F. O., (N. S.) VII, pp. 323, 324, reports a nesting colony there in December.</note>; whereas at Landana they arrive in May, and nest in the bluffs at Malimba a little later.<note n="2">Pechu&euml;l-Loesche, 1888, `Loango Expedition,' III, pt. 1, p. 266; Petit, 1899, Mem. Soc. Zool. France, XII, p. 72.</note>  They remain in the region at least until August, but are said to be absent in February and March.  North of the forest, in Nigeria, the breeding season is known to be in April and May.  Large nesting colonies are the rule.</p>

				<p>ADULTS.&mdash;Iris crimson, bill black, feet dark brownish.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;Sudanese belt from Senegal to Abyssinia, south almost to the edge of the equatorial forests, and in East Africa to the Rufiji River.  The breeding area is in the northern section of the range from West Africa to the Blue Nile and other parts of the eastern Sudan. Large nesting colonies tunneled in the banks of rivers are occupied mostly from April to June.  After breeding, thought Heuglin, the birds of the more easterly regions first wandered northward; but later the majority migrate southward, although some go to the Abyssinian plateau.</p>
				<pb n="320" id="t000120-p00326c.tif"/>
				<p>The southward movement brings numbers of Nubian carmine bee-eaters to the northern border of the Belgian Congo, and even down to the coastal region of East Africa.  During most of the rainy season they desert the Upper Uelle district, but return usually in October and by December are very common there.  An exceptional bird-of-the-year was once taken on September 9.</p>
				<p>The carmine bee-eaters are among the most striking birds of the dry season in the Uelle.  Their strong, direct flight changes to graceful swoops in pursuit of prey.  The call is rather loud with something metallic about its single-syllabled &quot;kimp!&quot;  Frequently seen along rivers in parties, they also range out over the grasslands and are quick to take advantage of any grass-fire, shooting in and out of the clouds of smoke in company with kites, swallows, and sometimes blue rollers, all catching bewildered grasshoppers and other insects fleeing the fire. &quot;Oiseaux de feu,&quot; as our Belgian friends called them, seemed doubly appropriate for these highly colored birds.</p>
				<p>They left the vicinity of the Dungu River in early March; and I do not believe they breed there, although a basketful of live individuals, on February 21, were said by natives to have been captured in nests. Our dissections showed no real evidence of breeding; and these birds may have been roosting in tunnels made by <taxonName>Melittophagus bullocki</taxonName>. The white eggs of <taxonName>Merops nubicus</taxonName> from the Sudan measure 24.5&ndash;26.5 mm. &times; 20&ndash;21.</p>
				<p>Insects were the sole food in the five stomachs I examined, and included grasshoppers, large wasps, and one dragon-fly.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;From Damaraland, the Transvaal, and possibly
<pb n="321" id="t000120-p00327c.tif"/> Natal northward to Nyasaland, the Ruzizi Valley, savannas of the Manyema, Lomami and Kwango districts.  There are specimens in the Congo Museum from Mutumbo Mukulu (Lomami), Baaba and Chutes Guillaume (Kwango), in addition to those in publications cited above, but none from the Katanga plateaus.  Not yet known from the Kasai or the Lower Congo, unless Johnston&apos;s reference to M. &quot;<taxonName idx_name="Merops rubicoides">rubicoides</taxonName>&quot; from Vivi was really based on this species.  More likely he meant <taxonName idx_name="Merops malimbicus">M. malimbicus</taxonName>.</p>
				<p>Although <taxonName idx_name="Merops nubicus">nubicus</taxonName> and <taxonName idx_name="Merops nubicoides">nubicoides</taxonName> are very closely allied, and the young of <taxonName idx_name="Merops nubicoides">nubicoides</taxonName> has at the very first a pale bluish throat, the adults of the two species differ not only in the color of the throat, but also that of the iris, which is dark brown in <taxonName idx_name="Merops nubicoides">nubicoides</taxonName>, crimson in <taxonName idx_name="Merops nubicus">nubicus</taxonName>.</p>
				<p>All the Congo records with dates fall within the months from April to August, inclusive.  This is just the part of the year, according to Sclater,<note n="1">1903, `Birds S. Afr.,' III, p. 63.</note> when the southern carmine bee-eater is absent from South Africa, so we may be certain that these birds are simply &quot;winter&quot; visitors to the southern Congo.  They were found breeding by Alexander on the Zambesi River in early November, by Belcher in southern Nyasaland in late September, and by Millar in Portuguese East Africa in the first half of October.</p>
				<p>In habits and voice this species is exactly like its northern counterpart. At Luvungi in the Ruzizi Valley I saw them in parties of four and six in early July, flying about high in the air, seemingly attracted by smoke from a grass-fire, and alighting on large acacia trees near a brook.  My two specimens were non-breeding adults in fresh plumage, and had been eating beetles and other insects, including several grasshoppers. A beautiful adult male was collected at Buta in the Lower Uelle by Brother Hutsebaut on July 15, 1934, but its occurrence there is purely accidental.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;Cape Province north to Angola and Lake Tanganyika, then through eastern Africa to the Sudan, and westward again to Senegal.  Not found in the equatorial forests, or in the savannas from the Lower Congo east almost to the Lualaba River, or in the Kivu highlands.  From Cape Province north to the Sudan the white bar across the primaries increases in width from 10 mm. to 31 mm.  The tail, likewise, grows longer; but its white spots do not enlarge with the same regularity in eastern Africa.  The largest white tail-spots are found in Angola.</p>
				<p><taxon><taxonName idx_name="Ph&oelig;niculus purpureus purpureus">P. p. purpureus</taxonName> (Miller)</taxon> is restricted to eastern Cape Colony, and from Zululand Austin Roberts has recently described <taxonName idx_name="Ph&oelig;niculus purpureus zuluensis">P. p. zuluensis</taxonName>.<note n="1">1936, Ann. Transvaal Mus., XVIII, p. 190 (Mkusi R.).</note> <taxonName idx_name="Ph&oelig;niculus purpureus marwitzi">P. p. marwitzi</taxonName> differs from the two foregoing by the larger spots on its wings and tail, the tail being longer and more purplish above.  It ranges from Natal to Kenya Colony.  <taxonName idx_name="Ph&oelig;niculus purpureus angolensis">P. p. angolensis</taxonName> is similar to <taxonName idx_name="Ph&oelig;niculus purpureus marwitzi">marwitzi</taxonName>, but usually longer-winged, bluer on the crown, and with larger spots on the tail.  <taxonName idx_name="Ph&oelig;niculus purpureus niloticus">P. p. niloticus</taxonName> is also like <taxonName idx_name="Ph&oelig;niculus purpureus marwitzi">marwitzi</taxonName>, but with slightly smaller spots on the tail, which is less purplish above, and gloss on body a little less brassy green.  It occupies most of the Anglo-Egyptian
<pb n="323" id="t000120-p00329c.tif"/> Sudan and the savannas of the Uelle.  <taxonName idx_name="Ph&oelig;niculus purpureus purpureus">P. p. guineensis</taxonName> is close to <taxonName idx_name="Ph&oelig;niculus purpureus niloticus">niloticus</taxonName> but a little more bluish green on nape and back and with more white on the tail.  From French Equatorial Africa it extends to the Gold Coast hinterland.  <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Ph&oelig;niculus purpureus senegalensis">P. p. senegalensis</taxonName> (Vieillot)</taxon>, a duller bird, with bill never becoming entirely red, occupies the region west of Sierra Leone.</p>
				<p>The distinctions between these races are often very slight, and individual variation considerable.  My measurements of <taxonName idx_name="Ph&oelig;niculus purpureus marwitzi">marwitzi</taxonName> from regions outside the Congo are: Wing in males, 141&ndash;145, in females, 138&ndash;142; tails 200&ndash;255.  This race is usually stated to reach the southeastern Congo.  The few specimens I have seen from Elisabethville and Lukafu are certainly very like <taxonName idx_name="Ph&oelig;niculus purpureus marwitzi">marwitzi</taxonName>.  A series of seven males and three females from Kiambi in the Congo Museum may also be placed here, though the wings of two of the males measure 148 and 151 mm.  At Tembwe on Lake Tanganyika Dr. Schouteden collected three males and two females which have rather broader white bars on the tail, and one of the males has the wing 151 mm.  Two males from Kabalo and a pair from Manakwa in the Manyema likewise show a great deal of white on the tail-feathers.  The wings of the three males measure 154&ndash;156 mm., that of the female 141.  None of these Congo specimens has a bluish crown, but their wing-length approaches that of <taxonName idx_name="Ph&oelig;niculus purpureus angolensis">angolensis</taxonName>.</p>
				<p>In the Upper Katanga, according to Neave and De Riemaecker these wood-hoopoes are usually seen in parties in the savanna woods. They have loud chattering notes, emphatic when alarmed.  Before taking flight they commonly go through a see-sawing motion on the bough.  Nests of <taxonName idx_name="Ph&oelig;niculus purpureus marwitzi">marwitzi</taxonName> have been found in Tanganyika Territory by Schuster<note n="1">1913, J. f. O., p. 542; 1926," idem, p. 539.</note> in May, September, and October, in old woodpecker holes or in a deep natural cavity in a dead tree.  The eggs were green, one set of three measuring 26.5&ndash;27.2 mm. &times; 17.7&ndash;18.5.</p>

				<p>ADULTS.&mdash;Iris dark brown, bill scarlet, feet scarlet with dusky claws.</p>
				<p>IMMATURE.&mdash;Iris dark brown; bill dusky with pink base; feet orange-red, claws blackish.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, south to the savannas of the Upper Uelle district and those near Lake Albert and Lake Edward. <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Ph&oelig;niculus purpureus ruwenzor&aelig;">P. p. ruwenzor&aelig;</taxonName> (Grant)</taxon>, based on a single female from Mokia, seems not to differ from the form found in the Uelle district.  Two of our females from Faradje and Aba have spots on only two of the outer tail-feathers. Dr. Bayer&apos;s specimen from Karemi in the upper Semliki Valley, not yet adult and apparently a male, has a white spot on the third rectrix on the left side, none on that on the right.</p>
				<p>Specimens from the Upper Uelle and Mahagi Port, as well as others from the vicinity of Mt. Elgon, differ from <taxonName idx_name="Ph&oelig;niculus purpureus marwitzi">marwitzi</taxonName> in the smaller size of the white areas on the tail.  The measurements of seven adult males and seven adult females from the Uelle and the vicinity of Mahagi are: wings of males, 131&ndash;151 mm., of females, 127&ndash;141; tails of males, 201&ndash; 228 mm., of females, 193&ndash;214; exposed culmen of males, 47&ndash;54 mm., of females, 38&ndash;42.  If these birds are not <taxonName idx_name="Ph&oelig;niculus purpureus niloticus">niloticus</taxonName>, then they may all be called <taxonName idx_name="Ph&oelig;niculus purpureus ruwenzor&aelig;">ruwenzor&aelig;</taxonName>.</p>
				<p>This race is more common in the northern part of the Uelle savannas than close to the forest border.  It frequents grasslands thickly grown up with trees, and crawls about on the boughs or even the trunks.
<pb n="325" id="t000120-p00331c.tif"/> Pairs or small parties up to six are the rule, flitting from tree to tree, and often attracting attention by their calls.  Besides a hoarse &quot;kuck&quot; they utter protracted chattering sounds of varying quality, like &quot;kek-ek-ek-ek-ek&mdash;&quot; or &quot;ka-k-k-k-k-k&mdash;.&quot;  Both adults and young have a disgusting odor like that of asafoetida, due probably to the secretion of the oil-gland.</p>
				<p>Dark-billed young seemed more numerous than adults from April to August, indicating that they had been reared in the dry season. At Niangara on November 12 a female had the ovary enlarged, while one from Faradje, December 22, seemed just to have laid.  She was snared at dusk as she entered a deep narrow cavity in a small tree, but her eggs could not be found.  Incubating females of this species are said to be very loath to abandon their eggs, a significant fact because of the close relationship of hoopoes and hornbills.</p>
				<p>Eleven stomachs all contained insect remains, of beetles, termites, a few caterpillars, ants, hemiptera, and a grasshopper.  One individual had eaten some small round millipedes, and three stomachs held stones from small fruits.</p>

				<p>Ranging from the interior of the Gold Coast Colony to Nigeria and the Lake Chad region, this subspecies has been reported from Bozum in French Equatorial Africa and may occur within our limits near the Ubangi River.  On the upper Kemo River, just north of the Ubangi, Dybowski collected a male and a female, both not quite adult, and three young in juvenal plumage.  The older specimens look somewhat like <taxonName idx_name="Ph&oelig;niculus purpureus niloticus">niloticus</taxonName> of the Uelle, perhaps because of their immaturity; the others do not help in determining the race.  An adult male from Beso and an adult female from Kousri, both obtained by Decorse, differ from the birds of the Uelle and seem to represent <taxonName idx_name="Ph&oelig;niculus purpureus guineensis">guineensis</taxonName>.  No specimen is yet known from the neighboring part of the Belgian Congo.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;From the Gold Coast eastward to the northern edge of the Cameroon forest, the Ituri, Uganda, and some of the forested highlands of Kenya Colony.  <taxonName idx_name="Ph&oelig;niculus bollei bollei">P. b. bollei</taxonName> occupies the forests of the Gold Coast and Southern Nigeria, and extends westward at least to the Ubangi River.  <taxonName idx_name="Ph&oelig;niculus bollei jacksoni">P. b. jacksoni</taxonName> of the highlands near Mt. Kenya is slightly larger, but only in average measurements, with longer bill, and supposedly purer white on the head.  Specimens from the Mau Escarpment and Mt. Elgon are closely similar to those of Kenya, and those of the highlands of the eastern Congo differ only in having slightly shorter bills.  So the range of <taxonName idx_name="Ph&oelig;niculus bollei jacksoni">jacksoni</taxonName> extends to the montane forests of the eastern Congo.  Strangely enough this wood-hoopoe seems not to ascend the slopes of Ruwenzori or the Kivu Volcanoes.</p>
				<p>Thus far it has been customary to use the name <taxonName idx_name="Ph&oelig;niculus bollei jacksoni">jacksoni</taxonName> also for specimens from the lowlands of the northeastern Congo.  These are all but indistinguishable from <taxonName idx_name="Ph&oelig;niculus bollei bollei">P. b. bollei</taxonName>, the wings of which, according to Bannerman, vary from 118 to 136 mm.  In nineteen specimens from the Congo lowlands the wings vary from 116 to 134 mm.,<note n="1">Those of the lowland forests of Uganda have wings 123&ndash;131 mm., according to van Someren, 1922, Nov. Zool., XXIX, p. 82.</note> and in nineteen from the Congo highlands from 123&ndash;140 mm.  The same measurement in <taxonName idx_name="Ph&oelig;niculus bollei jacksoni">jacksoni</taxonName> from Kenya Colony is 120&ndash;143 mm. While I shall call the lowland specimens from the Ituri <taxonName idx_name="Ph&oelig;niculus bollei jacksoni">jacksoni</taxonName>, further comparison may show this to be incorrect.  The few that are known from the neighborhood of the Ubangi River are <taxonName idx_name="Ph&oelig;niculus bollei bollei">P. b. bollei</taxonName>.  There they are found only near the northern edge of the forest belt, as they are in the Cameroon.</p>

				<p>SPECIMENS.&mdash;Bafwabaka, &female;, July 25.  Babonde, 2&male;, July 16, 19; &female;, July 19.  Medje, 2 &male;, Jan. 13, 17; &female;, Aug. 22; &female; im., Jan. 13.  Pawa, &male;, July 15.</p>
				<p>ADULTS.&mdash;Iris dark brown, rim of eyelids and bill scarlet, with cutting edges of both mandibles blackish; feet scarlet, claws dusky brown.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;Forested highlands of Kenya Colony from the Kikuyu district and Mt. Kenya to the Mau, Elgeyu, Mt. Elgon, and the highlands of the eastern Congo from the plateau west of Lake Albert south to that on the northwest side of Lake Tanganyika.  In the lowlands of the northeastern Congo and those of Uganda live similar but slightly smaller birds.  They are found in the forested Semliki Valley and along the edge of the great forest from the new post of Beni to Kilo, Arebi, the vicinity of Medje, and probably farther west.</p>
				<p>It is astonishing in how narrow a band this species ranges across the northern Congo.  From north to south it seems not more than fifty miles wide and it extends but little beyond the limit of unbroken forest.  The distribution in the Cameroon must be similarly restricted. Though frequenting heavy forest and keeping much higher above the ground, <taxonName idx_name="Ph&oelig;niculus bollei">P. bollei</taxonName> resembles <taxonName idx_name="Ph&oelig;niculus purpureus">P. purpureus</taxonName> in behavior and voice.  It travels in small parties, exploring the boughs and trunks of large trees, and has a prolonged chattering call not quite so loud as that of the savanna species.  I wrote it &quot;ch-k-k-k-k-k&mdash;&quot; and noted that it sometimes became more resonant toward the end.  Females seem to call like males, but more weakly.</p>
				<p>Dissections indicated a prolonged and perhaps irregular season for reproduction, probably during the rains; but no specimen was actually breeding.  The young are reared in cavities in trees.  Granvik<note n="1">1923, J. f. O., Sonderheft. p. 112.</note> found a nest in a decayed tree on Mt. Elgon, July 22, in which one nestling was still sitting.  The juvenal plumage lacks all trace of white on the face, the crown and back being glossed with green.</p>
				<p>Insects were noted by us in seven out of the eight stomachs inspected. These included naked caterpillars (in three cases), small beetles, a bug, and one earwig.  A spider with its egg-cocoon had also been eaten, as well as small berries and seeds (probably from fruit) which we found in five of the stomachs.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;Grasslands north of the equatorial forest, from Senegal to Abyssinia, Lake Albert, and Uganda. Also in grasslands south of the forest belt, from the lower Congo River to southern Angola.  <taxonName idx_name="Scoptelus aterrimus aterrimus">S. a. aterrimus</taxonName>, glossed with purple above, and with tail unspotted, ranges from Senegal to Lake Chad and the Ubangi River.  <taxonName idx_name="Scoptelus aterrimus emini">S. a. emini</taxonName> of the Nile region differs only in having the luster of nape and back a little less purplish.  <taxonName idx_name="Scoptelus aterrimus notatus">S. a. notatus</taxonName> of Eritrea and Abyssinia is still more bluish than <taxonName idx_name="Scoptelus aterrimus emini">emini</taxonName>, and usually has white spotting on its outermost tail-feathers.  These tail-spots are rare in <taxonName idx_name="Scoptelus aterrimus emini">emini</taxonName>, save in the young.  <taxonName idx_name="Scoptelus aterrimus anchiet&aelig;">S. a. anchiet&aelig;</taxonName> of the region south of the Congo forest has a longer, more graduated tail, with an irregular white band near the tips of two outer rectrices.</p>
				<p>The typical race is believed to occur in savannas near the great bend of the Ubangi River.  Dybowski&apos;s single female specimen, Mr. Berlioz writes me, was taken on the upper Kemo River, a little north of the Ubangi; and he cannot see that it differs from West African examples. Dr. Bannerman tells me that Alexander&apos;s immature specimen from the Ubangi River near Boduna likewise appears to be typical <taxonName idx_name="Scoptelus aterrimus aterrimus">aterrimus</taxonName>.</p>

				<p>ADULT MALE.&mdash;Iris dark brown; bill dark gray, corners of mouth yellow; feet blackish, soles green.</p>
				<p>ADULT FEMALE.&mdash;Similar, but bill gray with dusky base and culmen.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;From Sennar and Kordofan south to the savannas of the Uelle and to lakes Albert and Chioga.  We first observed this small wood-hoopoe between Niangara and Dungu, and then found it rather common from Faradje to the Sudan frontier.  Later I saw it also at Kasenyi on Lake Albert.</p>
				<p>It is a far less conspicuous bird than <taxonName>Ph&oelig;niculus purpureus</taxonName>, and goes about in smaller groups, usually indeed in pairs, feeding amid the leafy branches of trees and bushes.  The only notes I heard were a monotonous &quot;wh&abreve;, wh&abreve;, wh&abreve;, wh&abreve;,&mdash;&quot; repeated slowly by the males and most apt to be heard in the morning.</p>
				<p>Practically all the adults taken from April to December showed a slight enlargement of the reproductive organs.  A non-breeding female was examined in March, and I conclude that the breeding season in the Uelle may extend over a large part of the rainy season.</p>
				<p>Every one of the seven stomachs examined contained insect-remains. These seemed often to be of beetles; but four small caterpillars were noted, as well as a chrysalis and a spider.  One bird had also swallowed several berries.</p>

				<p>ADULT MALE (with black head).&mdash;Iris very dark brown; bill gray, shading to black at base, the yellow of the corners of the mouth running out along the sides of the bill; feet black.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;Gold Coast and Southern Nigeria to Cameroon, northern Congo, and Uganda.  <taxonName idx_name="Scoptelus castaneiceps castaneiceps">S. c. castaneiceps (Sharpe)</taxonName>, from Nigeria westward, has head and neck rufous in both sexes.  Wings of males 100&ndash;107 mm., of females 99&ndash;101.  Tails of males 165&ndash;170 mm., of females 154&ndash;160.  Exposed culmen in males 31&ndash;31.5, in females 26.</p>
				<p><taxonName idx_name="Scoptelus castaneiceps brunneiceps">S. c. brunneiceps</taxonName>, ranging from forested Southern Cameroon to the Ituri River, is dimorphic in color for adult males.  Some have heads black glossed with green, others have them pale brown or whitish. Females are always brown-headed.  Wings of males 94&ndash;105 mm., of females 92&ndash;95.  Tails of males 141&ndash;165 mm., of females 130&ndash;142. Exposed culmen in males 26.5&ndash;30 mm., in females 22&ndash;25.3.</p>
				<p><taxonName idx_name="Scoptelus castaneiceps adolfi-friederici">S. c. adolfi-friederici</taxonName> of Uganda and the borders of the Ituri forest is always pale brownish or whitish on the head in both sexes and apparently a little larger than <taxonName idx_name="Scoptelus castaneiceps brunneiceps">brunneiceps</taxonName>.  Wings of males 101&ndash;110 mm., of females 94&ndash;102.  Tails of males 162&ndash;186 mm., of females 146&ndash;185. Exposed culmen in males 27&ndash;30 mm., in females 24.5&ndash;26.4.  Not much importance can be attached to the exact shade of the head-feathering, for new feathers just growing out are darker and browner than the older worn ones.</p>
				<p>Because of their dimorphism and smaller size I call my specimens from Avakubi <taxonName idx_name="Scoptelus castaneiceps brunneiceps">brunneiceps</taxonName>.  This race may be expected to the westward in the Congo forest, but no form of this species has been found along the southern margin of the forest.</p>
				<p>In the vicinity of Avakubi these birds may be regular inhabitants of the tops of the tallest forest trees, but we never had an opportunity to see them save where some little clearing opened the field of vision. My first specimen, a black-headed adult male, sat alone in the upper branches of a large tree overlooking an abandoned plantation.  Over and over it repeated its &quot;wh&abreve;, wh&abreve;, wh&abreve;, wh&abreve;,&mdash;&quot; very similar to the call of <taxonName idx_name="Scoptelus aterrimus">S. aterrimus</taxonName>.  Later on we came across a small party in some forest trees still standing in a new clearing.  Near Avakubi breeding probably begins about May.</p>
				<p>One stomach that I examined held only insect-remains, another had some tiny fruits as well.</p>

				<p>ADULT MALE.&mdash;Iris dark brown; outer portion of bill light gray, base of mandible and sides of maxilla at base lemon-yellow, basal portion of culmen black; feet black.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;Northern and eastern margins of the Ituri forest, southward at least to Beni, and eastward through the forest patches of Uganda to the vicinity of Mt. Elgon and northern Kavirondo.  In the Ituri we found this race far more common near Babonde than was <taxonName idx_name="Scoptelus castaneiceps brunneiceps">brunneiceps</taxonName> near Avakubi.</p>
				<p>Its voice, audible for several hundred yards, is like that of <taxonName idx_name="Scoptelus castaneiceps brunneiceps">brunneiceps</taxonName>. This species is apt to call from a much more conspicuous perch, such as a dead branch in a tree-top, than <taxonName idx_name="Scoptelus aterrimus">S. aterrimus</taxonName> of the savannas. The specimens taken in July were noisy but not breeding.  Along the eastern edge of the forest, between Irumu and the Semliki Valley, this wood-hoopoe is fairly numerous.  Four specimens taken there from September 30 to October 11 were all non-breeding, and one female on November 8 showed only slight enlargement of the ovary.  So nesting seems to take place either in the dry season or early in the rains.</p>
				<p>Three stomachs of this wood-hoopoe all contained insect-remains, including winged ants.  One bird had also eaten three berries.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;From Natal north to the Juba River, Mt. Elgon, the upper Semliki Valley, and northern Angola. <taxonName idx_name="Rhinopomastus cyanomelas cyanomelas">R. c. cyanomelas</taxonName>, with tail in males 121&ndash;145 mm., and in females 113&ndash; 136, is found from Natal to Angola, while the longer-tailed <taxonName idx_name="Rhinopomastus cyanomelas schalowi">R. c. schalowi</taxonName> replaces it from the northeastern Transvaal<note n="1">Birds of intermediate dimensions from eastern South Africa may be taken to constitute a third race, <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Rhinopomastus cyanomelas intermedius">R. c. intermedius</taxonName> Roberts</taxon>.</note> through the greater part of Rhodesia and eastern Africa to Kenya Colony and the eastern Congo. In <taxonName idx_name="Rhinopomastus cyanomelas schalowi">schalowi</taxonName> the tails of males measure 147&ndash;185 mm., those of females 137&ndash;175.  Its white tail-spots are better developed.  In both races females have distinctly shorter bills than males, and are brownish on head and chest.</p>
				<p>In the Congo <taxonName idx_name="Rhinopomastus cyanomelas schalowi">schalowi</taxonName> is found below 5000 feet in the Upper Katanga, along the shore of Lake Tanganyika, in the Kivu district, and about Lake Edward.  Savannas with rather fine grass and numerous trees are its favorite haunts.  There the birds are seen singly or in pairs, the males occasionally repeating a &quot;wha, wha, wha, wha,&mdash;&quot; almost exactly like the voice of <taxonName>Scoptelus</taxonName>.  Calling continues at seasons when they are not breeding.</p>
				<p>Even at the extremity of its range, in the upper Semliki Valley, this wood-hoopoe is common.  Climbing about the boughs and tree-trunks in search of insects it shows surprising acrobatic skill.  Neave noted
<pb n="333" id="t000120-p00339c.tif"/> that in the Katanga it was often a member of a mixed bird party.  Its breeding season there is likely to be from September to December.</p>
				<p>In Southern Rhodesia, on October 7, Priest found a nest in a natural cavity only four feet up in a tree.  The three eggs, of a deeper blue-green than those of <taxonName>Ph&oelig;niculus purpureus</taxonName> and more definitely pitted with fine whitish dots, measured 24 &times; 18 mm.  The development of the young in <taxonName idx_name="Rhinopomastus cyanomelas cyanomelas">R. c. cyanomelas</taxonName> has been described by Hoesch<note n="1">1933, O.

				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;Western Europe to eastern Asia, south to tropical Africa, Ceylon, and Indo-China.  Seven races are commonly recognized, in addition to closely allied species in Madagascar and eastern and southern Africa.  The only Palaearctic race which migrates to Africa is <taxonName idx_name="Upupa epops epops">U. e. epops</taxonName>.  It breeds from western Europe to western Asia and northern Africa with the exception of Egypt.  Its southern limits in winter have been described above.  Egypt has a resident race, <taxonName idx_name="Upupa epops major">U. e. major</taxonName>, and the representative of this species breeding in tropical Africa is <taxonName idx_name="Upupa epops senegalensis">U. e. senegalensis</taxonName>, found from Somaliland and Abyssinia across the Sudan and Guinean savannas to Senegal.<note n="1"><taxon><taxonName idx_name="Upupa waibeli">U. waibeli</taxonName> Reichenow</taxon>, described from northern Cameroon, appears not to be even a valid race.</note>  In western and central Africa its range is limited on the south by the forest, to the east it reaches northern Uganda and occasionally Nairobi in Kenya Colony.  This race is distinguished from <taxonName idx_name="Upupa epops epops">epops</taxonName> by its slightly smaller size, richer body-coloration, greater area of white on the secondaries, and the lack of any whitish subterminal band on the crest.  Ten adult males from the Uelle have wings 133.5&ndash;145 mm., six females 127&ndash;136 mm.</p>
				<p>The Sudanese hoopoe is found during part of the year in the savannas of the Uelle and doubtless also along the upper Ubangi.  We saw it near Niangara in November, also at Dungu in February, while about Faradje we made certain that it disappeared completely during most of the rainy season.  The first date of appearance there in 1911 was November 9,
<pb n="335" id="t000120-p00341c.tif"/> in 1912, November 18.  At that time the rains have ceased in the Sudan, but not in the Uelle.  These hoopoes became more common in December, and departed again to the northward in April, at the first sign of the rains.  During their stay they nested.</p>
				<p>In appearance and behavior these hoopoes are like the European race, and they perch on the small trees, although their food is taken mainly on the ground.  Bare spots in pastures, cultivated land, and roadsides attract them, as well as freshly burned grassland.  Their flight is often undulating like a woodpecker&apos;s, the crest meanwhile depressed, though it is more often elevated when they perch.  Males utter a soft &quot;hoo-poo&quot; or &quot;hoo-poo-poo,&quot; very like the call of <taxonName>Cuculus gularis</taxonName>, and a hoarse &quot;hawing&quot; noise.</p>
				<p>Egg-laying probably begins in the latter half of December, and nests are either in holes in trees or in cavities in banks or termite hills.  The eggs are usually in sets of six or seven, according to Sir Geoffroy Archer, varying from pale blue or light sage-green to olive-brown, and measuring 23&ndash;26 mm. &times; 17&ndash;18.  Three eggs, apparently of this species, which Lang found to the north of Faradje on March 16, were whitish.  The nest was in a deep crack in a termite hill.  At Faradje on January 29, four rather large nestlings were brought by natives from a hollow in a tree, and on March 12 I found a nest with four half-grown young in a hollow limb of a savanna tree.  A half egg-shell remaining in this nest was grayish in color with a slight tinge of green.  The nestlings held their crests erect most of the time and their tails pointing upward, like young hornbills.</p>
				<p>In four of the eight stomachs examined I found ant-lions, apparently one of this hoopoe&apos;s favorite foods during the dry season.  Six spiders and a cocoon full of their young had been eaten by one bird.  Beetles and beetle-larvae were found in three of the stomachs, crickets also in three and just one small caterpillar.  In Asben, Captain Buchanan found that caterpillars were their principal food during May.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;From Cape Province to Landana, the lower and middle Congo River, Kasai district, Lake Tanganyika, Lake Kivu, the plains around Lake Edward, Kenya Colony, and occasionally to southern Abyssinia.</p>
				<p>Thus it occurs widely in the southern and eastern grasslands of the Congo, and I have seen specimens taken in every month except March. In Southern Rhodesia Priest saw very few hoopoes during the months from April to July, and farther south they are believed to be partially migratory.</p>
				<p>Though often regarded as a race of <taxonName idx_name="Upupa epops">U. epops</taxonName>, and only a little more rufous than brightly colored examples of <taxonName idx_name="Upupa epops senegalensis">senegalensis</taxonName>, <taxonName idx_name="Upupa africana">U. africana</taxonName> lacks the white bar across the primaries and is not known to interbreed with the more northern form.  On the west they are separated by the equatorial forest, but in the eastern Congo their ranges do not meet, and <taxonName idx_name="Upupa africana">africana</taxonName> is scarce near Lake Edward.</p>
				<p>In habits the South African hoopoe is exactly like <taxonName idx_name="Upupa epops senegalensis">senegalensis</taxonName>, feeding largely on the ground and flying with lightness and grace.  Its call is usually of three syllables, but two or four notes may also be given together. In the Katanga Neave called it a rather shy bird, generally most in evidence during June and July, when fires have passed through the savanna woods.  It seems to nest there in July.  A pair which I collected on the northeast shore of Lake Tanganyika, July 26, seemed almost ready to breed, so nesting probably begins there in the latter part of the dry season.  In the Congo Museum there are well-grown nestlings from Kitobola (February) and Paso-Konit&eacute; (August).  In the Lower Congo, at least, they would seem to breed twice a year.</p>
				<pb n="337" id="t000120-p00343c.tif"/>
				<p>Nests have been found in Natal and eastern Cape Province between late September and January, and in Nyasaland toward the end of September. Four to six eggs, bluish white, bluish green, or pale fawn-brown, are laid in cavities of trees or in crevices in termite mounds or stone walls.  Nesting material is not used.  Dimensions of eggs are 24.6&ndash;26.7 mm. &times; 16.2&ndash;18.3.</p>
				<p>Incubating birds, according to Captain Priest, often sit so tight that they can be caught in the hand.  This characteristic of hoopoes and wood-hoopoes is of special interest in view of their close relationship to the hornbills.</p>

				<p>SPECIMENS.&mdash;Batama, &male;, &female;, Sept. 18.  Avakubi, 3 &male;, Jan. 29, Aug. 26, Oct. 8; &female;, June 8; &male; im., Nov. 9; &female; im., Jan. 29.  Bafwabaka, &male;, Jan. 6.  Rungu, &male;, June 24.  Niangara, 2 &male;, May 9, Nov. 9.</p>
				<p>ADULT MALE.&mdash;Iris grayish brown or dark brown, naked orbit dark grayish blue; tip of beak and upper half of maxilla brownish red, rest of beak black; feet bluish gray, with soles yellowish gray, claws blackish.  Beneath the angle of the jaw is a triangular patch of naked, purplish-pink skin, which hanges rather loosely.</p>
				<p>ADULT FEMALE.&mdash;Bill blackish save for a brownish-red line on culmen, and skin at angle of jaw grayer, less noticeable.  Young birds have no red on beak, which is dark gray, with buff at tip, and sides of mandible whitish below.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;Lowland forests from the vicinity of Bolobo east to the Semliki Valley, north to the Upper Uelle, and south to Luluabourg in the Kasai.  It is a fairly common bird in the unbroken forest area, and not rare in the heavier forest galleries on the north and south.</p>
				<p>The dwarf hornbill is usually found amid the boughs of the forest trees, never very close to the ground.  Once I saw an adult female in the center of the post of Avakubi, but as a rule it does not venture beyond the shade of the forest.  This is the most silent as well as the smallest of African hornbills, and seldom are more than two or three seen together. The youngest bird collected, with tail not yet fully grown, was sitting with one of its parents close to some trees where a band of monkeys (<taxonName>Cercopithecus</taxonName>) was feeding.  According to natives with me, the dwarf hornbill accompanies monkeys, but much less often than <taxonName>Tropicranus</taxonName>.</p>
				<p>The breeding season is during the rains.  Only two of the specimens listed above were in condition for reproduction: at Rungu, June 24, and at Avakubi, August 22.  Near Avakubi on August 3 I saw an adult bird fly to a knot-hole in a dead limb high in a forest tree and cling there as though feeding its mate.  The young bird taken at Avakubi on November 9 could not have left the nest more than two weeks before.</p>
				<p>South of the equator, at Lukolela, I found a nest on January 30, likewise in a knot-hole high up in a limb of a tree in heavy forest.  The male bird made frequent but very brief visits to the nest, carrying what seemed to be insects, not fruit.  It appeared to be gathering all its food within 100 yards of the nest, and I have seen it visit the nest twice within a quarter of an hour.</p>
				<p>Fruit forms but a very small part of the food of this species.  Only two out of twelve stomachs contained fruits, and not more than one or two in each.  The others held only insects: bettle-remains in eight, caterpillars in four, grasshoppers in three, and mantises likewise in three. Winged termites, winged ants, a cicada, and a spider were each noted in only one case.</p>

				<p>ADULT MALE.&mdash;Iris light yellowish gray, or light yellow, naked orbit dull brown; bill red; feet dark brown, light greenish or yellowish on soles.</p>
				<p>ADULT FEMALE.&mdash;Similar, but with a black stripe along anterior half of culmen, and tip of mandible black.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;Forests of Upper and Lower Guinea, from Liberia to the Semliki Valley.  From Southern Nigeria westward it is represented by <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Lophoceros camurus pulchrirostris">L. c. pulchrirostris</taxonName> (Schlegel)</taxon>, which is darker brown above, particularly on the crown, than <taxonName idx_name="Lophoceros camurus camurus">L. c. camurus</taxonName> of Lower Guinea.  The range of the latter race extends from the Cameroon southward to the Mayombe forest and eastward to the Uelle district, the Semliki Valley, and no doubt the Manyema.  In the Kasai district it has been taken near Luebo, but not at Luluabourg.</p>
				<p>Specimens of <taxonName idx_name="Lophoceros camurus camurus">camurus</taxonName> from the Cameroon, Gaboon, and western Congo are a little more apt to have small light spots on the lesser wing-coverts than are those from the eastern Congo.  This is especially true of females.</p>
				<p>We found this small brownish hornbill much less common near Avakubi in the central Ituri forest than in the border regions of the forest, as at Nala or at Lukolela.  It is seen most often in groups of three or four, especially in second-growth woods and near the borders of clearings.  It would be a very inconspicuous bird if it did not have a surprisingly loud
<pb n="341" id="t000120-p00347c.tif"/> voice, audible for a quarter of a mile.  It repeats a descending series of rather mournful notes which I would write &quot;kwarru.&quot;  There is a slight quaver in the tone, and the number of notes is sometimes as many as ten.</p>
				<p>Breeding may be carried on through a large part of the year during the rains.  Near Niangara two nestlings were secured through natives in November, toward the end of the rains; and at Lukolela I collected a breeding male on October 10, at the beginning of the rains there.  Dryseason specimens are non-breeding.  The nest is undoubtedly in a hole in a tree.  Young nestlings have the body-skin pale flesh-color, the iris gray, and the skin of the orbit grayish white, the bill being reddish orange.</p>
				<p>In eleven stomachs examined there was not a trace of fruit, only insect-remains. Beetles were noted in at least four, grasshoppers in three, wasps twice, hemiptera twice, and caterpillars twice.  There were also one mantis and a cocoon containing a pupa.</p>

Aba, &male;, Dec. 31.</p>
				<p>ADULT MALE.&mdash;Iris dark brown, bare orbit and skin at angle of jaw black.  The greater part of the bill is covered with a horny layer of cream-buff.  At the tip of both mandibles the deeper coloration of the bill is exposed, dark red, and this color often runs backward beneath the lower mandible and along each side of the culmen. The tomia are largely blackish, mingled with dark red.  Feet blackish, under surface of toes gray.</p>
				<p>ADULT FEMALE.&mdash;Differs only in having the basal half of the gonys black instead of red, and the skin at the angle of the jaw orange.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;From the Lower Guinea Coast eastward across the Cameroon, Gaboon, and Congo to Jinja in Uganda.  From the northern edge of the Congo at Semio and Doruma it extends south to northern Angola, the upper Kwango River, and Kinda in the Lulua district.  On the borders of its range it keeps very much to gallery forests, so that its abundance varies locally.  Close to the post of Faradje we did not encounter it, yet toward Aba it is not uncommon.  Similarly along the lower Congo it is generally rare, save where there are considerable woods.</p>
				<p>In the central parts of the Congo these common hornbills are not found in the undergrowth of the virgin forest, but usually amid second growth and about clearings.  They gather in flocks often of five to ten individuals, and roam especially about old plantations.  The flight is slow, several hard wing-beats raising the bird a little, only to be followed by a descending swoop.  In such alternating fashion an adjacent tree is reached, where a short stop may be made.  Members of the party will leave a tree one at a time, often proceeding in single file, and are not at all wary.  The flight is practically noiseless, unlike that of the large hornbills. The voice is shrill but weak, and the short notes intermediate between a whistle and a yelp are repeated rapidly.  They are imitated in the Mangbetu name, &quot;Nakw&eacute;akw&eacute;a.&quot;</p>
				<p>The majority of specimens were found to be non-breeding, and nesting takes place during the rains.  A nestling with tail not half-grown was brought to Lang at Akenge in the southern Uelle in September, and
<pb n="343" id="t000120-p00349c.tif"/> a nest was examined near Medje on July 13, At Aba a breeding male was taken as late as December 31.</p>
				<p>The nest at Medje was discovered by watching the male bringing food to a knot-hole in a tall tree standing in an old plantation.  The hole was about 90 feet up, and from it a native climber removed the female and one egg.  The female had not yet shed any of her remiges; and her tail, though badly worn, had only some of the outer rectrices growing in. Dissection showed that she would probably have laid three more eggs. The one collected was white, with slightly roughened surface, 40.1 &times; 28.6 mm.</p>
				<p>The entrance to the nest was just large enough to admit the female, and from around it our climber removed some pieces of dried dung.  Examination of the foliage below showed that fecal matter was being ejected from the hole.<note n="1">An excellent summary of the breeding habits of the genus <taxonName>Lophoceros</taxonName> is given by Moreau, 1937, P. Z. S. Lond., (A) pt. 3, pp. 331&ndash;346.</note>  The stomach of the female contained some large beetles, brought to her by the male.</p>
				<p>The food of this hornbill is approximately half fruit, half insects.  Of sixteen stomachs, nine contained fruits of various sorts; and four more held palm-nuts, usually of small size.  Eight had remains of hard-bodied insects, including beetles; four more, grasshoppers; and caterpillars and hemiptera were each noted once.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;From southwestern Abyssinia through eastern Africa to eastern Cape Province, and to Angola and the Portuguese Congo.  <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Lophoceros melanoleucos melanoleucos">L. m. melanoleucos</taxonName> (Lichtenstein)</taxon><note n="1">Austin Roberts (1936, Ann. Transvaal Mus., XVIII, p. 268) believes that Lichtenstein&apos;s description was not based on a bird of this species.  In that case the species will have to be called <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Lophoceros suahelicus">L. suahelicus</taxonName> Neumann</taxon>, and the South African race <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Lophoceros suahelicus australis">australis</taxonName> (Roberts)</taxon>.</note> of South Africa, north to the Zambesi Valley, is rather dark and large.  <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Lophoceros melanoleucos suahelicus">L. m. suahelicus</taxonName> Neumann</taxon>, ranging from southern Tanganyika Territory to the Tana River, is somewhat smaller, with wings of males 235&ndash;245 mm., those of females 205&ndash;232.  <taxonName idx_name="Lophoceros melanoleucos geloensis">L. m. geloensis</taxonName>, extending from southern Abyssinia to the Katanga, is the blackest of all the races, and has the wings of males 239&ndash;270 mm., of females 220&ndash;251.  <taxonName idx_name="Lophoceros melanoleucos alboterminatus">L. m. alboterminatus</taxonName> of western Angola and the Lower Congo is lighter and more brownish than any of the foregoing, with wings of males about 226&ndash;232, and of females 215&ndash; 220.</p>
				<p>Neumann&apos;s <taxonName idx_name="Lophoceros melanoleucos stegmanni">stegmanni</taxonName> is supposedly synonymous with his <taxonName idx_name="Lophoceros melanoleucos geloensis">geloensis</taxonName>, through specimens from the vicinity of Mt. Elgon seem to have wings averaging slightly longer than those from the eastern and southeastern Congo.  Within our limits <taxonName idx_name="Lophoceros melanoleucos geloensis">geloensis</taxonName> is a rather common bird in savannas from the west shore of Lake Albert and the Semliki Valley to the Kivu district, the Upper Katanga, and west to the Sankuru district, Luluabourg, and Dilolo.  It frequents open savannas with fair-sized trees, in the eastern Congo, and while it does not ascend the western slopes of Ruwenzori, it may be seen in the Kivu district at 6700 feet near the bases of the volcanoes.  On the mountains west of the Ruzizi Valley I have noted one individual as high as 7500 feet.  In the Upper Katanga it makes its home in the savanna woods.</p>
				<p>In life this pied hornbill resembles <taxonName idx_name="Lophoceros fasciatus">L. fasciatus</taxonName>, but it less sociable, going usually in pairs, and is more silent.  Its alarm note is said to be shrill and rather squeaky.  The buoyant, undulating flight also resembles that of <taxonName idx_name="Lophoceros fasciatus">fasciatus</taxonName>.</p>
				<p>The nesting of <taxonName idx_name="Lophoceros melanoleucos melanoleucos">L. m. melanoleucos</taxonName> has been observed frequently in South Africa where the eggs, three to five in number, are laid in December
<pb n="345" id="t000120-p00351c.tif"/> or January.  They are creamy-white, rather rough, and measure 39.8&ndash;40.9 mm. &times; 29.2&ndash;30.4.  The nest is in a hollow tree, and the entrance is plastered up with dung&mdash;probably that of the female&mdash;so as to leave only a narrow slit for the delivery of food by the male.  The female molts while incubating, but remains fat during her voluntary imprisonment, which may last seven or eight weeks.  It is believed that the female may leave the nest after the young are partly fledged, and that they are again walled in until ready to fly.<note n="1">Sch&ouml;nland, 1897, Trans. S. Afr. Phil. Soc., IX, pp. 1&ndash;7.  See also Cowles, 1926, S. Afr. Journ. Nat. Hist., XI, pp. 20&ndash;24, 3 photos.</note>  Such a procedure has recently been observed with nests of <taxonName idx_name="Lophoceros erythrorhynchus">L. erythrorhynchus</taxonName> in the Frankfort Zoological Garden.</p>
				<p>In the Upper Katanga nesting takes place toward October, for in the following month Mouritz saw a female which had been taken from her nest, and which had nearly finished molting.  An adult male which I collected near Elisabethville in August had gonads undeveloped.  Near Lake Edward I suspect that the breeding season commences about September.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;Western Angola north to the Lower Congo and Landana.  Specimens from northern Angola and the Lower Congo are much lighter brown than the other races, but a male from Mombolo on the Benguella Plateau is only a little lighter than most South African specimens and has the wing markedly longer than in birds from the Lower Congo.  Perhaps <taxonName idx_name="Lophoceros melanoleucos angolensis">angolensis</taxonName> would be the correct name for the paler birds of northern Angola.  B&uuml;ttikofer described <taxonName idx_name="Lophoceros melanoleucos alboterminatus">alboterminatus</taxonName> as similar in general coloration to typical <taxonName idx_name="Lophoceros melanoleucos melanoleucos">melanoleucos</taxonName>, and the white tips on the median rectrices of three of his specimens are not a racial character.</p>
				<p>In the Lower Congo this lighter brown subspecies is rather common. I have seen it near Matadi and Boma about patches of woods, singly or in pairs.  In that region it lives almost side by side with L. fasciatus.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;From Angola and Northern Rhodesia to Nyasaland and Tanganyika Territory, north to Taveta.  The typical race extends from the Kwango River, Malanje, and Mossamedes east to the Katanga, Lake Bangweolo, and the southwest corner of Lake Tanganyika.  <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Lophoceros pallidirostris neumanni">L. p. neumanni</taxonName> Reichenow</taxon><note n="1">1894, `V&ouml;g.

				<p><taxonName idx_name="Lophoceros pallidirostris pallidirostris">L. p. pallidirostris</taxonName> seems scarcely to enter the Kasai, although Dr. Schouteden secured two specimens at Tshisika, in the southern part of the district.  In the Upper Katanga it is found commonly, in pairs, in the savanna woods.  The male repeats a shrill whistled note, not so thin and high-pitched as that of L. nasutus.  Nesting takes place during the dry season; a male shot near Elisabethville on August 13 was in condition to breed, but still accompanied by its mate.  From Chitau, Angola, I have seen two females, taken on September 6 and 10, evidently from nests. Their remiges and rectrices are all growing in.</p>

				<p>ADULT FEMALE.&mdash;The tip of the beak is dark red, and the skin at the angle of the jaw very light green, instead of gray.</p>
				<pb n="347" id="t000120-p00353c.tif"/>
				<p>NESTLING.&mdash;Iris gray, orbit yellowish white.  Bill dusky with greenish tip and streaks on maxilla.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;Senegambia and Nigeria to the eastern Sudan and Arabia, southward through eastern Africa to Zululand, and westward again to Angola.</p>
				<p><taxonName idx_name="Lophoceros nasutus nasutus">L. n. nasutus</taxonName>, without raised casque and with outer secondaries usually tipped with white, ranges from Senegal to Abyssinia, northern Uganda, and northern Kenya Colony.  In the eastern part of the range, the bill seems to grow longer than in West Africa.  <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Lophoceros nasutus forskalii">L. n. forskalii</taxonName> (Hemprich and Ehrenberg)</taxon> of western and southwestern Arabia is slightly larger and has whitish edgings on the feathers of the whole back.  <taxonName idx_name="Lophoceros nasutus epirhinus">L. n. epirhinus</taxonName> is distinguished in the males by having a higher ridge to the culmen, pointed or truncate anteriorly so as to form a slight casque.  The bill of the female differs little from that of <taxonName idx_name="Lophoceros nasutus nasutus">nasutus</taxonName>, but the secondaries are darker at their tips.  This last race occupies most of southern tropical Africa.</p>
				<p>Within our limits <taxonName idx_name="Lophoceros nasutus nasutus">L. n. nasutus</taxonName> is restricted to the northern savannas, from the Ubangi east to Mahagi Port, and it has not been found in the vicinity of Lake Edward or Lake Kivu.  Thus in the Congo it is a lowland bird, though plentiful in Abyssinia at 4000 to 6000 feet.  In the Upper Uelle we found <taxonName idx_name="Lophoceros nasutus nasutus">nasutus</taxonName> a rather solitary bird, perching in the larger trees of the upland savannas.  It owes its Azande names, &quot;Swanga&quot; and &quot;Pi&abreve;ga,&quot; to its piping voice, often heard during the dry season.  The notes are uttered from a perch, the bird raising its beak, opening it slightly, and commencing with a weak, high-pitched &quot;pee, pee, pee&mdash;.&quot;  After a while the syllables become longer and louder, &quot;pi&abreve;ng-a, pi&abreve;ng-a, pi&abreve;ng-a&mdash;,&quot; until the performance ends, perhaps twenty seconds from the start.  Though hardly loud enough to attract much attention, these notes can be heard for several hundred yards.</p>
				<p>This hornbill spends only the drier months in the Uelle, withdrawing thereafter to the Sudan.  Lynes<note n="1">1925, Ibis, p. 380.</note> noted a northward migration in Darfur during the latter half of June, though some remained there throughout the year.  In 1911 we noted its return near Faradje on November 22, and during two years there found that they disappeared about the first of May.</p>
				<p>Before that, nesting had been completed in holes in trees.  A brood of four nestlings was brought to Lang at Garamba on March 14; and a young bird, about large enough to leave the nest, was shown to us between
<pb n="348" id="t000120-p00354c.tif"/> Faradje and Nzoro on April 25.  At Mauda Dr. Schouteden obtained two very young birds on March 22.<note n="1">The female molts all her wing- and tail-quills while in the nest.  Records of nesting in other regions will be found in Millet-Horsin, 1923.  Rev. Fr. O., XV, p. 234; Pitman, 1930, Ool. Rec., X, pp. 75, 76; and Cheesman, 1935, Ibis, pp. 316, 317.</note>
				</p>
				<p>Fruit is a small item in the diet of this species, for it was found in but one of the five stomachs examined.  All of them contained insect-remains, which included nine large grasshoppers, some beetles, and a large bug.  One old male bird had even eaten a chameleon.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;From the vicinity of Mombasa in East Africa, and the region west of Lake Victoria, southward to Zululand and Bechuanaland, westward to Mossamedes.  The range extends to the Ruzizi Valley, down the west shore of Lake Tanganyika, and across the Katanga; but I know of no record from the Kasai or Lower Congo.</p>
				<p>This southern race, with a better developed ridge surmounting the culmen, has a shorter bill than the typical form.  In males of <taxonName idx_name="Lophoceros nasutus nasutus">L. n. nasutus</taxonName> the culmen varies from 86 to 105 mm., in females from 75 to 83 mm. A series of measurements by Austin Roberts<note n="2">1917, Ann. Transvaal Mus., V, p. 250.</note> shows that the culmen of <taxonName idx_name="Lophoceros nasutus epirhinus">epirhinus</taxonName> in South Africa varies from 82.5 to 88.5 mm. in males, and from 66 to 70.5 mm. in females.  Five adult males from the southeastern Congo have the culmen 78&ndash;86 mm.  In one male from the Ruzizi Valley this measurement is 93 mm., yet the rudimentary casque is a little more developed than in males from the Uelle.  Secondaries and inner primaries are narrowly tipped with white.  It is thus somewhat intermediate between <taxonName idx_name="Lophoceros nasutus epirhinus">epirhinus</taxonName> and <taxonName idx_name="Lophoceros nasutus nasutus">nasutus</taxonName>.  Berlioz has reported another example of <taxonName idx_name="Lophoceros nasutus epirhinus">epirhinus</taxonName> from the same locality.  Two females from Tembwe have the culmen 70 and 75 mm. long.</p>
				<p>In the region of Lake Tanganyika the period of reproduction comes evidently in the southern dry season, for my Ruzizi Valley male on July
<pb n="349" id="t000120-p00355c.tif"/> 18 was in condition to breed.  In western Tanganyika Territory a brood of four young of <taxonName idx_name="Lophoceros nasutus epirhinus">L. n. epirhinus</taxonName>, taken by a black from the inclosed nest, was brought to B&ouml;hm on September 26.

Niangara, 2 &male;, May 10, 16; 2 &female;, May 20, Dec. 8; &female; juv., May 20.</p>
				<p>ADULT MALE.&mdash;Iris yellowish white, often with dark brown inner rim, orbit blackish.  Bill black with a creamy line along the middle part of the cutting edge of maxilla, and another light stripe tinged with rufous, running forward from the nostril to meet it.  Skin at angle of jaw flesh-color or reddish, colored by the blood in it. Feet light blue, claws black.</p>
				<p>ADULT FEMALE.&mdash;Differs in lacking the light stripe on the bill in front of the nostril, though it does have the whitish lower edge to the maxilla.  Skin at angle of jaw as in male.</p>
				<p>NESTLINGS.&mdash;Have the iris at first light brownish, the bill pale greenish gray, feet whitish faintly tinged with yellow, and the skin of whole body flesh-color. Half-grown young show bluish-gray or grayish-white irises.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;Whole forest area of Upper and Lower Guinea.  <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Tropicranus albocristatus albocristatus">T. a. albocristatus</taxonName> (Cassin)</taxon> of Sierra Leone, Liberia, and
<pb n="351" id="t000120-p00357c.tif"/> the Ivory Coast has throat black and wing-quills without white tips. <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Tropicranus albocristatus macrourus">T. a. macrourus</taxonName> (Bonaparte)</taxon> of the Gold Coast has the chin white and a mixture of white on the throat, and its primaries are sometimes narrowly tipped with white.  <taxonName idx_name="Tropicranus albocristatus cassini">T. a. cassini</taxonName> of the Lower Guinea forest differs from both of the preceding by the conspicuous white tips on all its remiges, and all the greater wing-coverts show spots at their tips.  Chin and throat are black.</p>
				<p>This race of the long-tailed hornbill ranges from the vicinity of Lagos in Southern Nigeria eastward to the Upper Uelle district and the Semliki Valley, southward to Banana, the Mayombe forest, Kasanga near the Kwango River, and the southern Kasai district.  It inhabits the larger gallery forests north and south of the solid forest belt, and is a rather common bird in the area of solid forest.  While not restricted to the virgin growth, it is less conspicuous than one might expect, and does not come out into clearings.</p>
				<p>In the Uelle and Ituri districts, as in West Africa, the natives all tell of its habit of following bands of monkeys.  The comradeship is shared by a large squirrel, <taxonName>Protoxerus stangeri</taxonName>.  One might assume that the monkeys and the hornbills were simply attracted to the same trees by fruit, but this is not borne out by our stomach examinations.  Insects compose the greater part of the birds' food.  More probably the monkeys drive insects from their concealment, and these are preyed upon by the hornbills.  Such a habit is attributed by Ridley<note n="1">1901, Straits Branch Journ. Roy. Asiatic Soc., No. 36, p. 105. See also Shelford, 1917, `A Naturalist in Borneo,' p. 56.</note> to a drongo of Borneo, <taxonName>Dissemurus paradiseus</taxonName>, which follows macaques.  H. C. Raven tells me that in Celebes <taxonName>Dicruropsis leucops</taxonName> accompanies <taxonName>Cynopithecus</taxonName> in the same manner.</p>
				<p>Usually found in pairs or family parties, the long-tailed hornbills haunt the lower boughs of forest trees, frequently coming close to the ground.  When they pursue each other the long rectrices flutter as they dodge and turn, yet the birds are agile enough to catch insects habitually on the wing.  One of their usual notes is a peculiar &quot;&umacron; &umacron; &umacron; &umacron;&mdash;ah!,&quot; not loud, but suggesting a human imitation of a hy&aelig;na&apos;s wail.  The same hollow quality characterizes the birds' other shorter notes.</p>
				<p>In the Iturr district the breeding season appears to last from July to December, while at Niangara on May 20 we found an adult female accompanied by a young bird with tail but half-grown.  They could not have left the nest more than a week before.  At Lukolela I was shown a
<pb n="352" id="t000120-p00358c.tif"/> nest on January 15, and at Luluabourg in the Kasai Father Callewaert secured a young bird, about ready to leave the nest, on November 6.</p>
				<p>The nest found near Avakubi on August 3 was about 35 feet from the ground in the hollow trunk of a fair-sized tree along the border of a banana patch.  The male bird was catching insects on the wing in the vicinity and carrying them to the minute aperture, where he clung against the bark, supported by his tail.  A native climber broke out the little dung-like material which had been stuck to the edges of the hole, and pulled out two young birds, still nearly naked, with eyes closed.  To secure their mother we had to cut down the tree.  During her confinement she had shed all her wing and tail-quills.  These littered the nest, and her new rectrices were still less than half their full length.  She was well fed, actually fat; and while there were few stones from fruit in the nest, remains of insects were numerous, especially the wings of a large cicada, <taxonName>Ugada grandicollis</taxonName>.  There were also a few feathers of a small bird, evidently eaten by the hornbills.</p>
				<p>Of the twenty-two stomachs examined, only eleven contained any remains of fruit.  Four of them held a half dozen small palm-nuts, and seven others wild fruits.  Every stomach disclosed some remains of insects, while one shrew and a young passerine bird like a weaver were found in addition.  Beetles were present in 13 stomachs, grasshoppers in 6, caterpillars in 3, cicadas in 2, a large leaf-hopper once, and a large bug once.  Several insect-larv&aelig; other than caterpillars were noted, and the insects in 6 stomachs were not" identified.  The shrew had been eaten by an immature hornbill, and the small bird by a female imprisoned in her nest.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;Forests of Lower Guinea, from the vicinity of Lagos to the Semliki Valley, and south to northern Angola, the Kasai district, and probably the Manyema.  <taxonName idx_name="Bycanistes sharpii sharpii">B. s. sharpii</taxonName> ranges from Southern Nigeria to western Cameroon, Lower Congo, and northern Angola.  Males of this race have at most only a suggestion of a casque, and in both sexes at least six outer primaries are nearly or quite black. <taxonName idx_name="Bycanistes sharpii duboisi">B. s. duboisi</taxonName> of southeastern Cameroon and the Upper Congo has a fairly well developed casque in males, and the outer primaries with a considerable amount of white.  Females have the mandible less deeply corrugated than those of <taxonName idx_name="Bycanistes sharpii sharpii">sharpii</taxonName>.  <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Bycanistes fistulator">B. fistulator</taxonName> (Cassin)</taxon> of Upper Guinea is closely allied to <taxonName idx_name="Bycanistes sharpii">B. sharpii</taxonName>, but has much more black on secondaries and rectrices.</p>
				<p>Within our limits <taxonName idx_name="Bycanistes sharpii sharpii">B. s. sharpii</taxonName> occurs rather commonly in the Lower Congo, and probably up to Leopoldville.  Intermediates between <taxonName idx_name="Bycanistes sharpii sharpii">sharpii</taxonName> and <taxonName idx_name="Bycanistes sharpii duboisi">duboisi</taxonName> are found along a line running from the vicinity of Stanley Pool to the middle Kwango River and Luluabourg in the Kasai district. A specimen from Luluabourg may be referable to <taxonName idx_name="Bycanistes sharpii sharpii">sharpii</taxonName>, though having some white on the outer primaries.</p>
				<p>In habits this typical race is exactly like <taxonName idx_name="Bycanistes sharpii duboisi">duboisi</taxonName>.</p>

				<p>SPECIMENS.&mdash;Avakubi, 2 &male;, Feb. 23, Apr. 3.  Gamangui, &male;, Jan. 29.  Niangara, 4 &male;, Apr. 8, 25, June 7; 2 &female;, Apr. 8, May 25; &male; juv., May 27.</p>
				<p>ADULT MALE.&mdash;Iris dark brown, sometimes slightly reddish, orbit black.  Bill generally whitish, shading to dull light yellowish at base, with large areas of blackish on the mandible and on the lower portion of the sides of the maxilla.  Claws and large scales on feet greenish black, softer skin blue-gray.</p>
				<p>ADULT FEMALE.&mdash;Iris dark brown, orbit and skin near base of beak greenish gray.  Bill without any black patches, its sheath more deeply corrugated basally than the male&apos;s.</p>
				<p>MALE NESTLING.&mdash;Iris light gray exteriorly, blackish on inner edge, orbit dark gray.  Bill light greenish, feet bluish gray, claws black.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;Lowland forests from the neighborhood of Stanley Pool and the River Ja, Cameroon, eastward to the Upper Uelle, the valley of the Semliki, the vicinity of Kasongo, and southward to the northern Kasai.  In the Uelle its range extends out along the gallery forests to the border of the Sudan, though we never saw it close to Faradje. Males from Kwamouth and Kunungu have casques averaging shorter than those of the northeastern Congo.</p>
				<p>At Niangara, where two species of <taxonName>Bycanistes</taxonName> occur, this one was commoner than <taxonName idx_name="Bycanistes subcylindricus">B. subcylindricus</taxonName>.  In the Ituri forest it is not unusual,
<pb n="355" id="t000120-p00361c.tif"/> going in pairs or trios, but far more difficult to secure than <taxonName idx_name="Bycanistes albotibialis">B. albotibialis</taxonName>; and on the Congo River we noted it but a few times, whereas <taxonName idx_name="Bycanistes albotibialis">albotibialis</taxonName> was seen frequently flying across the stream.  The flight of <taxonName>Bycanistes sharpii</taxonName> produces only a slight swishing, and its voice differs from that of <taxonName idx_name="Bycanistes albotibialis">albotibialis</taxonName>, being usually a loud &quot;kah-k-k-k-k-,&quot; almost like raucous laughter.  Both <taxonName idx_name="Bycanistes sharpii">sharpii</taxonName> and <taxonName idx_name="Bycanistes albotibialis">albotibialis</taxonName> have shorter and less mournful calls than those of <taxonName>Ceratogymna atrata</taxonName> or <taxonName>Bycanistes subcylindricus</taxonName>.</p>
				<p>The nesting season, in the northern Ituri, probably commences in January, for the male taken at Gamangui was in condition to breed; but at Niangara it may be retarded by the drought until March.  On May 27, a native brought us a nestling of <taxonName idx_name="Bycanistes sharpii duboisi">duboisi</taxonName>, with wing-quills scarcely two-thirds grown, which he had taken from a hollow in a tall tree, discovered through the visits of the male, bearing food.  As the man climbed the tree, the female bird heard him and flew out, leaving her single offspring.  That the female had molted during her confinement was shown by the presence of more than 20 of her large flight-feathers in the nest.  The young bird did not hold its tail erect, hopped awkwardly on the ground, and flew with great effort a couple of yards.</p>
				<p>At Lukolela, on July 29, I visited a nest in a hollow of a live forest tree.  The entrance was a knot-hole some 28 feet up, and natives had already captured the female and cracked her two white eggs.  These were partially incubated, and seemed to have measured about 50 &times; 35 mm.  The hole was said to have been walled in with clay, but I saw none of the material.</p>
				<p>When brought to me the incubating female lacked all her rectrices. They may have been pulled out, and none was yet being renewed.  A gradual molt of the remiges had just begun, for the two innermost primaries of each wing were growing out, while the third had just been shed.</p>
				<p>Adult female birds may also molt wing- and tail-quills in the open, for one I collected at Niangara on May 25, and which seemed from the condition of ovary and oviduct to have finished breeding recently, was renewing the middle and outer rectrices, and a gradual molt was taking place in the wings.  Perhaps she had just left a nest.</p>
				<p>Every one of the nine stomachs examined contained fruit of some sort.  In 3 cases there were also insects: a large beetle, about 30 very large winged ants, and 2 small black wasps (<taxonName>Polybioides melaina</taxonName>).  On one occasion, toward sundown, I watched three hornbills of this species catching termites on the wing.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;From eastern Cape Province north to the coastal area of East Africa as far as the Tana River, the interior of Tanganyika Territory, the Katanga, Angola, and the middle Kwango River, near 7&Degree; 30&prime; S. latitude.  There are specimens in the Congo Museum from Pweto on Lake Moero, Elisabethville, Kinda in the Lulua district, and the falls of the Kwango River.  At Sankisia Dr. J. Bequaert shot an example and preserved careful notes of its coloration.</p>
				<p>The Kwango River specimens are smaller in every way than those from the region of the Katanga.  The adult males from Wilhelm Falls have wings 273 and 275 mm., culmen to base 120 mm. in both, length of casque 93 and 89.5 mm.  Three males from the southeastern Congo have wings 283, 290, 299 mm., culmen 124, 130, 133 mm., casque 111, 112, 128 mm.  Females differ in much the same degree.  An adult male from the Lumi River, Kenya Colony, has a larger casque than those of the southeastern Congo, 133 mm. long, and is much more streaked with silvery on malar region and ear-coverts.  The Kwango birds would certainly deserve separation from the typical form if it were possible to define geographic limits for such a race.</p>
				<p>Of the habits of <taxonName idx_name="Bycanistes bucinator">B. bucinator</taxonName> in Northwest Rhodesia, Neave said that it is almost invariably to be found in dense woods in the neighborhood of water, where the number of fruit trees would appear to be the attraction. In life the pinkish-red orbital skin is very conspicuous, even when the birds are flying over.  Belcher described their varied cries as suggesting the bray of some animal, or perhaps the noise of a toy trumpet, or even the crying of a child.</p>
				<p>From Gazaland Swynnerton<note n="1">1908, Ibis, pp. 405, 406.</note> reported a nest in a large hollow tree-trunk, at a height of 25 feet, entered through a narrow slit which was further walled in with a mixture of red forest earth and the bird&apos;s own droppings.  It was located in the last days of December, and held four unfledged young.  Evidently the eggs were laid at intervals, for one of the nestlings was far more advanced than its fellows.  In Natal, A. G.
<pb n="357" id="t000120-p00363c.tif"/> Millar<note n="1">1921, S. Afr. Journ. Nat. Hist., III, pp. 217&ndash;219.</note> found that sets of two pale cream-colored eggs were laid, and that the same hollows in trees were used from year to year, the entrance being plastered up completely during the time that it was vacant.  There can be no doubt that the male does gather wet clay to plaster up the sides of the opening, for I have seen this in a film taken in the London Zoo.</p>
				<p>Nesting may be expected to begin in the Katanga toward October. Mouritz<note n="2">1914, Ibis, p. 35.</note> had two young <taxonName>Bycanistes</taxonName> from a nest brought to him at Sibokwa&apos;s kraal in November, and there is good reason to suppose that they were of this species.</p>

				<p>SPECIMENS.&mdash;Lukolela, &male;, July 18.  Risimu, near Stanleyville, &male;, Sept. 8. Bafwaboli, &male;, Sept. 12.  Bafwasende, &male;, Sept. 24.

				<p>ADULT MALE.&mdash;Iris dark brown, rim of eyelids blackish, but naked orbit creamy or yellowish white.  Bill largely blackish brown, but with the tips of both mandibles, and most of the casque, light greenish gray.  Larger scales on feet, like the claws, greenish black, but the softer skin bluish gray.</p>
				<pb n="358" id="t000120-p00364c.tif"/>
				<p>ADULT FEMALE.&mdash;Iris grayish brown, feet often lighter than male&apos;s: greenish gray, and tip of bill may be greenish white.</p>
				<p>MALE NESTLING.&mdash;Iris bluish gray with dusky inner rim; bill grayish green; feet bluish gray, with larger scales and claws blackish.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;From the district just north of Lagos in Southern Nigeria, eastward across the Cameroon to the Upper Congo, and southward to Landana, middle Kwango River, and southern Kasai.  There is no published record from the Belgian Mayombe, and during my own brief visit there I never saw it.  In the Congo its range coincides in general with the area of heavy forests, extending northward to the Bomokandi River, eastward to the Semliki, and southward to Tshikapa in the Kasai.  The southernmost point at which we noted it on the Congo River was a telegraph post just below Lukolela.  Only in the Kasai and Kwango districts does it range far out into gallery forests.</p>
				<p>Specimens from the eastern Congo forest average slightly larger, in wing, tail, and beak, than those from Kunungu, Lukolela, and Eala.  In the central Upper Congo and the Kasai the size is more or less intermediate. With such gradual intergradation it is hopeless to recognize any races.</p>
				<p>On the upper Congo, between Lukolela and Stanleyville, this is the commonest large hornbill seen from the steamer.  The flight is not at all swift, but gives the impression of extreme lightness.  Their course is a leisurely undulation, for several beats of the wings are followed by a descending glide, and before alighting the birds often sail for a considerable distance.  The wing-beats produce a loud &quot;ch-ch-ch&mdash;.&quot;  In the Ituri the species is very common, as it appears to be in nearly all areas of unbroken lowland forest.</p>
				<p>They seek the highest trees, and attract attention by their raucous voices, as well as by the commotion when they take wing.  Flocks of five or six are common, gathering in trees that bear their favorite fruits. A descending series of harsh notes, &quot;Rack, kack, kak-kak-kak-&hellip;.,&quot; is given frequently, or a single &quot;kack!&quot;</p>
				<p>Among the Wabali and the Bandaka of the Ituri forest, <taxonName>Bycanistes albotibialis</taxonName> is of prime importance in their superstitious customs.  It might be called their totem, for although the natives of the Congo usually have no scruple against eating any bird whatever, these tribes hold the black-and-white hornbill (called by them &quot;Nasasa&quot;) in such reverence that none of the tribe save young boys may eat it.  The taboo is further extended to all hornbills, large and small, each species of which bears its distinctive name.  The large black <taxonName>Ceratogymna</taxonName>, for instance,
<pb n="359" id="t000120-p00365c.tif"/> is known as &quot;Ambumbu.&quot;  For some obscure reason the black-and-white monkey (<taxonName>Colobus abyssinicus ituricus</taxonName>) is likewise not eaten by men of the tribe, although monkeys of the genus <taxonName>Cercopithecus</taxonName> are highly esteemed, and continually hunted.</p>
				<p>The importance of the hornbill was explained by Fariala, a Mobali chief near Avakubi, as follows: The bird cannot be eaten because of its connection with the peculiar scars which decorate the chest and abdomen of almost every Mobali man, crescentic marks usually placed symmetrically in two vertical lines.  <figure/> These decorations denoting manhood are acquired at about the age of fifteen, after an elaborate ceremony.<note n="1">The rite is known as &quot;Mambela,&quot; and a good description of it will be found in T. A. Barns, 1922, `Wonderland of the Eastern Congo,' pp. 196&ndash;203.  See also F. W. H. Migeod, 1923, `Across Equatorial Africa,' pp. 191, 199, 200.</note>
				</p>
				<p>A nest of the &quot;Nasasa&quot; must first be found, and the female taken out and placed in a basket.  No other hornbill will do.  A great reunion is now held, and the boys to be initiated receive a prolonged thrashing from the grown men of the community, who are provided with switches eight feet long.  After this test of courage, they are taken out into the forest, the hornbill is brought forth, and is alleged to bite the marks on the skin of their bodies.  To hide the wounds from the sight of women, they are covered with leaves, and the boys return to their village.  The rite has no relation with that of circumcision, usually undergone at a much earlier age.</p>
				<p>All this is as Fariala told it.  One cannot believe that the bird, however vigorous its bite, can actually cut such regular wounds, and other Wabali have admitted that they are made with a knife.  Yet all show the same respect for the hornbill, and refuse to eat it.  After the &quot;Mambela&quot; the boys wear a heavy collar made of raphia fibre and pieces of wood, which is only discarded when completely frayed out.  It must then be cast into a river.</p>
				<p>In a village on the Ituri River, I witnessed the whipping portion of the &quot;Mambela&quot; on January 2; but at that time of year we found no proof of the birds' nesting.  Specimens with enlarged gonads were taken at Medje on April 26, and at Rungu, June 30; and at Poko Dr. Christy collected a half-grown nestling on July 8.  Nesting must last through a still greater period of the year, for at Medje on October 2 we also secured from natives a young bird with tail but half grown.  It was hardly big enough to have left the nest.</p>
				<p>At Lukolela, just south of the equator, I have collected males in
<pb n="360" id="t000120-p00366c.tif"/> breeding condition on July 18 and August 24, and found a nest on December 12, in heavy forest not far from my house.  This was in the hollow trunk of a large, rough-barked tree (<taxonName>Petersia africana</taxonName>), opening by a knot-hole 81 feet above the ground.  For thirty-four days we watched the male bringing food to the opening, which had been closed in to a slit just the size of his beak.  On December 22 he made eighteen visits in less than ten and a half hours, on January 12 fourteen in about ten and three-quarters hours.</p>
				<p>Finally on January 14 the tree was felled, and the adult female with her single offspring captured.  The mother was molting her wing- and tail-quills gradually, so that at any time she would have been able to fly. The nestling&apos;s wings and tail were not fully grown, and it made no attempt to fly.  The partition at the entrance to the nest was composed entirely of dung.  The nest was perfectly clean, so I suppose that both female and young defecate toward the opening, and the beaks of both male and female model the edge of the slit that remains open.</p>
				<p>At this same season another pair of <taxonName idx_name="Bycanistes albotibialis">B. albotibialis</taxonName> had a nest in one of four large trees standing well out in a clearing, a mile and a half away from the first nest.  By January 4 the female seemed already to have emerged, leaving a young bird in the nest.  On February 14, I visited still another nest which had been despoiled the day before by natives.  It was also in a hollow <taxonName>Petersia</taxonName> tree, 72 feet from the ground, and the partition at the entrance was still intact.  Here again it was of dung, without any clay.  The single well-grown nestling was brought to me, but its mother had been eaten.  By comparing the quills plucked from her with the old ones found in the nest I was able to see that she too had been molting gradually, and that her power of flight had not been lost. <taxonName idx_name="Bycanistes albotibialis">B. albotibialis</taxonName> either has two periods of reproduction at Lukolela, or it nests during at least six months.<note n="1">For an excellent comparative study of the breeding habits of African hornbills, see Moreau 1937, P. Z. S. Lond., (A) pt. 3, pp. 331&ndash;346.</note>
				</p>
				<p>Of eighteen stomachs, all contained fruits but one, which held some indeterminate vegetable matter.  In one case the fruit was that of the parasol tree (<taxonName>Musanga Smithii</taxonName>), a yellowish pulp filled with small seeds; the other birds had eaten a great variety of forest fruits.  Insects are not altogether disdained, they were found in four of the stomachs, and comprised 2 mantises, 1 large green orthopter, 1 dragon-fly, and a large ant. At Avakubi I have watched this hornbill, as well as <taxonName idx_name="Bycanistes sharpii duboisi">B. sharpii duboisi</taxonName>, hawking for winged termites.</p>

				</p>
				<p>This species of hornbill is known from the northern end of Lake Nyasa, in the highlands, and might perhaps be expected to reach the Katanga.  Thus far, however, I know of no satisfactory record.  Mouritz mentioned it as noticed near the Musoshi escarpment in the Upper Katanga, but no one has yet collected a specimen in that region.  <taxonName idx_name="Bycanistes cristatus">B. cristatus</taxonName> should easily be recognized in life by the blackness of its wingquills, which are whitish only at the very base.  In East Africa it prefers heavy forest with large trees, and this type of vegetation is scarce in the Katanga.</p>

				<p>SPECIMENS.&mdash;Niangara, &male;, Mar. 28; &female;, &male; juv., May 26.  Between Faradje and Aba, 3 &male;, Nov. 30, Dec. 2, 25; 4 &female;, Nov. 27, 30, Dec. 2, 25.</p>
				<p>ADULT MALE.&mdash;Iris brown, orbit dusky; bill and anterior half of casque black,
<pb n="362" id="t000120-p00368c.tif"/> basal half of casque whitish above; soft skin of feet blue-gray, larger scales and claws blackish, soles yellowish.</p>

				<p>MALE NESTLING.&mdash;Iris rather light gray, changing to blackish on inner edge, rim of eyelids greenish yellow, orbit gray; bill greenish gray, shading to blackish at tip, and to whitish at top; feet bluish gray, soles yellowish, claws black.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;From the forests of the Gold Coast and Southern Nigeria east to the Uelle district, Mt. Elgon, and the eastern edge of the Congo forest; also in northern Angola.  Instead of extending across the Congo forest, it is found only around the borders.  <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Bycanistes subcylindricus subcylindricus">B. s. subcylindricus</taxonName> (Sclater)</taxon> is restricted to the Gold Coast and Southern Nigeria.  <taxonName idx_name="Bycanistes subcylindricus subquadratus">B. s. subquadratus</taxonName> is larger than the typical race, with more white on the base of the casque in males, and ranges from the northern edge of the Cameroon forest eastward to the Ubangi, the Uelle, Uganda, Mt. Elgon, the Yala River, and Bukoba.  In the eastern Congo it occurs in the Semliki Valley, near the Rutshuru River, and on the mountains west of Lake Kivu and northwest of Lake Tanganyika.  On Mt. Elgon it is a bird of mountain forest between 6800 and 8500 feet, but on west Ruwenzori I saw it no higher than 4000 feet.  Absent from the Kivu Volcanoes, it reappears at 6000 or 6500 feet to the west of Lake Kivu. Along the southern edge of the Congo forest it is unknown, yet it occupies forest patches in northern Angola.</p>
				<p>In the Upper Uelle this hornbill is decidedly local, restricted to rather small wooded areas with giant trees.  At Niangara it was uncommon. More were seen near Gangura&apos;s, to the southwest of Faradje, and most of our specimens were collected at Madrapili&apos;s, midway between Faradje and Aba.  During a week&apos;s stay there I saw about eight individuals. They kept near the forest, going usually in pairs and perching in high trees.  The flight is noisy, and both sexes utter a loud mournful note, slowly repeated and like that of <taxonName>Ceratogymna atrata</taxonName>, or a shorter, hoarser, reiterated call.  From their actions and the condition of the females' ovaries, I thought laying would start there by early January.</p>
				<p>At Niangara on May 26 a female and her nestling (with tail half grown) were brought to us alive by a native, who had taken them from a hole high up in a large tree.  The opening was almost closed with mud or some similar material, and there was only a single young bird.<note n="1">The breeding habits are probably very similar to those of <taxonName idx_name="Bycanistes cristatus">B. cristatus</taxonName>, well described by Moreau, 1936, Journ. E. Afr. Ug. N. H. Soc., XIII, pp. 1&ndash;28.</note>
				</p>
				<p>Nearly all the remiges and rectrices of the mother had been pulled out, split down the middle and tied in a bunch to adorn her captor&apos;s hat.
<pb n="363" id="t000120-p00369c.tif"/> According to his story, most or all of these feathers had been freshly renewed, and were still surrounded with a sheath at the base.  I could still make sure that at least six of the rectrices, as well as some of the remiges, were being renewed.  The wings seem to undergo a gradual molt.</p>
				<p>However, she was far from &quot;wasted and enfeebled.&quot;  In spite of two days' confinement without food in a basket, there was considerable fat inside the skin of the abdomen, as well as a good layer beneath the muscular abdominal wall; and fat is scarce in hornbills.  She bit vigorously when handled.  The young bird did not hold its tail vertically, as we noted with the young of <taxonName>Ceratogymna</taxonName>, though no doubt it could. The flexible base of hornbills' tails is a family characteristic, and most advantageous in the nest.</p>
				<p>At 8000 feet on Mt. Elgon Granvik<note n="1">1923, J. f. O., Sonderheft, pp. 98&ndash;101.</note> saw a nest in July, placed between two rocks.  The single young bird had escaped after a native destroyed the protecting partition.</p>
				<p>Of the six stomachs we examined, every one contained fruit, with no trace of insects or any other animal food.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;From Liberia to the Cameroon, then eastward to the Mbomu River and the Semliki Valley, and southward to the Cuanza River in Angola and Kinda in the Lulua district of the Congo.  Found throughout the heavy forest of the Congo, and even in gallery forests to the north and south.  Usually a lowland bird.  I did not see it above 1250 meters on west Ruwenzori, nor is it known from the Kivu Volcanoes.</p>
				<p>Along the Congo River between Kwamouth and Stanleyville the great black hornbill is only rarely noticed from the steamers, but throughout the whole area of solid lowland forest it is common enough.  While keeping to the high trees and shunning the clearings about villages, it advertises its presence with a loud, mournful bellowing.  The number of syllables varies, but the notes usually sound like &quot;wha-o, wha-o, whao, wha-a-a-aw, whaaaaw.&quot;  The tone is nasal and the bird seems deeply distressed.  The loudest calling comes from males, very often in flight, and carries certainly for half a mile.  A loud swishing of the wings always accompanies their wing-beats and the flight is less gliding than that of <taxonName>Bycanistes albotibialis</taxonName>.  Three of four birds are the most one ever sees in a party.</p>
				<p>Some ten miles east of Medje on August 20 the natives showed Lang a nest from which they had already taken the female and a single nestling. The old bird had been eaten, while the youngster was brought to us alive.  This nest was in a hollow opening by a knot-hole seventy feet up in a large forest tree (<taxonName>Macrolobium Dewevrei</taxonName>).  When cut down the tree was found to measure 145 feet in total height, and its base was 10 feet in circumference.  Pieces of the earthy material which had protected its entrance showed that the exterior surface had been of grayish dirt and sand, while inside it was darker in color and plainly composed of excrement, containing stones of fruit and bits of insects.</p>
				<p>The floor of the nest, only a few inches lower than the entrance, was composed of rotten wood.  Only a half-dozen large feathers of the female
<pb n="365" id="t000120-p00371c.tif"/> were found inside; and while others may have been thrown out by the bird or by the men who opened the nest, it seems probable that the female molted gradually during her confinement.  In the nest were the remains of at least eight different kinds of fruit, as well as pieces of crab. Most of the seeds were those of <taxonName>Ricinodendron Heudeloti</taxonName>, a large tree.</p>
				<p>The young male nestling was partially feathered, much darker rufous on the crown than an adult female, and with neck black save for a rufous border along the naked throat-area.  We kept it alive for a week. The stubby tail was often bent up close against the back, so that it could easily accommodate itself to a cramped nesting hole.  Its beak was light greenish, with no sign of a casque; the skin of body and head grayish violet.  As yet there was no trace of the gular wattle, and the skin of the throat could be inflated with air, recalling the throat-sac of <taxonName>Bucorvus</taxonName>.</p>
				<p>I doubt whether <taxonName idx_name="Ceratogymna atrata">C. atrata</taxonName> has any definite breeding season in the central Congo forest.  Almost all our adult specimens were found to be non-breeding.  A single egg is probably all they lay, and it seems likely that the female remains in the nest about three months.</p>
				<p>Out of sixteen stomachs examined, all but one contained fruits. Four of them were whole palm-nuts.  The other fruits were of various kinds and sizes, one so large that it almost filled the bird&apos;s stomach.  Insects were found in six of the examinations, large winged ants being present twice, and beetles about four times.  One hornbill had swallowed sixty-six green caterpillars, and another a single millipede.</p>

				<p>The yellow-casqued hornbill is largely a bird of Upper Guinea, ranging from Portuguese Guinea to the neighborhood of the Cameroon River, and the supposed record from the Loango Coast is certainly erroneous.

				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;From eastern Cape Colony through southeastern Africa to central Kenya Colony, the northeast shore of Lake Tanganyika, and the savannas of the southern Congo.  On the west it reaches northern Angola and northern Damaraland.  Unknown in the Lower Congo, and apparently uncommon in the Kasai district, though there is a female in the British Museum collected by Torday near Lusambo.  In the Upper Katanga and Marungu it appears to be numerous, and the Congo Museum has a female from Funda Biabo.  Mr. Lestrade tells me that this hornbill is seen and heard regularly near Makamba Mission inland from Nyanza on Lake Tanganyika.</p>
				<p>Adult males have the whole orbit, chin, and throat bright scarlet, while in females the bare skin of chin and anterior throat are dusky gray with a pearly bluish lustre, the orbit and remainder of bare throat-skin being scarlet.  The iris of the male is said to be pale sea-green, that of the female is grayish cream-color.  The skin of the throat can be inflated in much the same way as the sac of the marabou stork.  There is no intergradation in East Africa between <taxonName idx_name="Bucorvus cafer">B. cafer</taxonName> and <taxonName idx_name="Bucorvus abyssinicus">B. abyssinicus</taxonName>.</p>
				<p>The southern ground-hornbill makes its home in open savanna country, and is found in pairs or small parties, up to seven or eight, walking about in search of food.  They are fond of spots where the grass has been burned, and roost at night in trees.  Their flight is noisy and labored, and when disturbed they may take to the trees.  The food is most varied, including insects and their larv&aelig;, frogs, reptiles, and even small mammals. When reared in captivity they make most amusing pets.<note n="1">See W. L. Sclater, 1911, Avicul. Mag., (3) II, pp. 120&ndash;123, and Swynnerton, 1913, Journ. S. Afr. Orn. Union, IX, pp. 83&ndash;100.</note>
				</p>
				<p>The voice is a reiterated booming or humming sound, and male and
<pb n="367" id="t000120-p00373c.tif"/> female answer each other with a distinct difference in tone.  The calls carry afar&mdash;a mile and a half, perhaps&mdash; and often are heard before day has fully broken.  Nesting begins in Natal in October, and not more than a month later in the southern Congo, for newly fledged young are seen with their parents from January to April.  Dr. van Someren thinks the young may continue to accompany their parents for two or three years.</p>
				<p>The nest is usually in a hollow in a large tree, but there are also accounts of their rearing young in stick nests.  Sets consist of one or two eggs, elongate oval, and plain white or very pale bluish, with roughened texture, measuring 66.7&ndash;79 mm. &times; 45.7&ndash;54.<note n="1">See especially Carlisle, 1923, S. Afr. Journ. Nat. Hist., IV, pp. 121, 122; and Monard, 1932, Bull. Soc. Neuch&acirc;tel. Sci.

				<p>SPECIMENS.&mdash;Garamba, &female;, July 1.  Faradje, &male;, Aug. 8; 2 &female;, Sept. 25, Oct. 12. Aba, &male; im., July 15.</p>
				<p>ADULT MALE.&mdash;Iris brown; lores and orbit bluish gray and dark blue, respectively; throat indigo blue; cheeks and lower portion of throat rose-madder.  Casque and bill black, with a pink-and-gray patch beneath nostril.  Feet black.</p>
				<p>ADULT FEMALE AND IMMATURE MALE.&mdash;Naked skin of orbits and throat entirely blue.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;Across the whole continent from Senegal to Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, Abyssinia, and Eritrea; south in the west to the edge of the Guinean forests, in the east to Gallaland and Uganda.  Within our limits the northern ground-hornbill is found only in the northern savannas, eastward to the northern shores of Lake Albert.  We did not see it south of the Uelle and Kibali rivers, though de Calonne collected a female at Niangara and we noted a party of three at Gangura&apos;s village near Nzoro.</p>
				<pb n="368" id="t000120-p00374c.tif"/>
				<p>In the Uelle district there was no indication of migration, a few being seen at all times of year.  Sometimes they were single or in pairs, but never more than three together.  Such trios probably represented a family, for only one had the red on the throat which distinguishes the adult male.  When perching in a tree, with throat-sac inflated, and standing upright on its long legs, the ground-hornbill almost suggests
<figure>
						<figDesc>Fig. 25.  <taxonName>Bucorvus abyssinicus</taxonName>, male.  &times;  1/2, approximately</figDesc>
					</figure>  some large wading bird.  On the wing, however, it again looks like a hornbill, the flight being buoyant, with the usual alternation of flapping and gliding, and not noisy except when the bird is rising from the ground.</p>
				<p>In my experience they are exceedingly wary, and feed in cultivated fields, pastures, or newly cleared land, wherever the grass is not too high. Taking wing far out of range, they sometimes pause for a moment on
<pb n="369" id="t000120-p00375u.tif"/> some low tree to look around.  All across the Sudan a stuffed ground-hornbill&apos;s head is tied on that of native hunters, who crawl through the grass when stalking game.  The apparent proximity of the bird reassures the unsuspecting victim.<note n="1">See especially Alexander, 1907, `From the Niger to the Nile,' I, p. 36.</note>
				</p>
				<p>The voice of the northern ground-hornbill is like that of the southern species, a deep &quot;hoo&quot; or &quot;hum&quot; repeated at short intervals, and heard especially toward dusk.  From this comes the Logo name, &quot;Bu-luku.&quot;</p>
				<p>The nesting is surrounded by mystery.  A. Brehm<note n="2">Heuglin, 1871, `Orn. Nordost-Afr.,' I, p. 734.</note> is said to have had a nestling taken from a hollow tree that was not walled up.  A. L. Butler<note n="3">1905, Ibis, p. 353.</note> was told by Gorringe that he took a single egg from a hole in a baobab at Roseires on June 3.  In Darfur Lynes<note n="4">1925, Ibis, p. 382.</note> received a newly fledged youngster on September 20, said to have been taken from a hollow tree.  At Wadelai on April 23 Emin<note n="5">Schubotz, 1921, `Tageb. Emin Pascha,' VI, pt. 2, p. 105.</note> obtained a fledgling, with tail-feathers still short, which his soldiers claimed they had taken from a stick-nest in the crown of a tree.  Large hollow trees must be hard to find, but they are surely the ordinary nesting place.</p>
				<p>Dissections as well as the behavior of live birds led me to expect the breeding season to begin near Faradje shortly after November.  This is supported by Emin&apos;s observations at Wadelai, though farther north, in the Sudan, nesting seems to take place in June or July.  In northern Nigeria nests have recently been reported in hollow trees at heights of only ten to fifteen feet, on March 21, April 4 and 17.<note n="6">Lipscomb, 1938, Ibis, p. 153; Shuel, 1938, Ibis, p. 471.</note>  Two eggs are the normal set.  There seems to be no plastering of the entrance.  An egg laid in captivity was described by Reichenow as whitish with rough surface, 71 &times; 48 mm.  Shuel gives measurements of six eggs as 61&ndash;72.5 mm. &times; 47&ndash;51.5.</p>
				<p>The omnivorous propensities of ground-hornbills are well known, yet the contents of one stomach I examined were remarkable: a piece of the hoof of a small antelope, many small feathers, a lizard (<taxonName>Mabuya perrotetii</taxonName>), a frog, many dung-beetles, a large water-bug, a caterpillar, many insect eggs, a millipede, and two small bean-pods.  Three other stomachs held insect-remains, including beetles and large ants, two small cucumber-like fruits, seeds, and other vegetable material.  These birds kill snakes, birds, and doubtless small mammals as well.</p>

				<p>This nestling is in the soft &quot;mesoptyle&quot; plumage so characteristic of young owls, and the wings and tail are not full grown, measuring 104 mm. and 46 mm., respectively.  The bare toes, small bill, and small ear-opening clearly fix its proper genus, and the cinnamon-rufous remiges and rectrices, barred with blackish and with whitish spots on the outer webs of the distal primaries" identify it plainly.  The soft plumage beneath is nearly uniform cinnamon, that of crown and back somewhat ruddier, and more distinctly, though finely, barred with dusky.</p>

The characters which seem to differentiate these races will be found in my paper of 1930.</p>
				<p><taxonName idx_name="Otus senegalensis ugand&aelig;">O. s. ugand&aelig;</taxonName> is a well-established race, moderately dark grayish, with blackish markings pronounced, a tawny wash on the upper back, and feathers of breast with a rusty cross-bar or median patch.  The wing measures 131&ndash;143 mm.  One of my males from Faradje has been compared with Neumann&apos;s types, and the series of eight from the Uelle shows remarkable uniformity of coloration.  In Brussels and Tervueren I have been unable to find any specimen from Banalia, and feel sure that the species does not occur there.  I now think that the &quot;Ruzizi-Kivu&quot; specimen in the Congo Museum is <taxonName idx_name="Otus senegalensis graueri">graueri</taxonName>; but it seems very likely that <taxonName idx_name="Otus senegalensis ugand&aelig;">ugand&aelig;</taxonName> extends to the Rutshuru Valley, where the voice of the species is to be heard frequently.</p>
				<p><taxonName idx_name="Otus senegalensis senegalensis">O. s. senegalensis</taxonName> is usually somewhat grayer above than <taxonName idx_name="Otus senegalensis ugand&aelig;">ugand&aelig;</taxonName>, with markings on breast less contrasted; but some examples are rather rufous.  Possibly that race will be found to reach the savannas near

Mr. Berlioz tells me that it is really <taxonName>Otus senegalensis</taxonName>.</note>
				</p>
				<p>In suitable districts of the northeastern Congo the Uganda sc owl is not at all rare.  Its presence cannot be overlooked at the season when the birds are calling.  During two successive years at Faradje we found that it was in August or the first days of September that they began giving at dusk or by night a single short call-note, repeated at frequent intervals.  The sound is slightly metallic rather than musical, and resembles &quot;k'hong&quot; or &quot;k'hawng.&quot;  Often a second bird answers in a much weaker voice, so I suspect that the female calls too.  They continued to advertise their presence until the end of February.  In the upper Semliki Valley I heard exactly similar notes of this owl in January, and Colonel Hackars has recently secured a specimen of <taxonName idx_name="Otus senegalensis ugand&aelig;">ugand&aelig;</taxonName> there.  I listened to them also in the Rutshuru Valley in early May.</p>
				<p>The calling is often so continuous throughout the night that one wonders when the birds eat.  When approached in the dark they are not at all timid, but they can scarcely be seen amid the foliage.  A close range one may sometimes hear a fainter, shriller cry, or other low weak notes.  On rare occasions a bird will call in the middle of the day.</p>
				<p>Near the post of Faradje they favored a thick patch of low wood around a spring, but they also haunted trees along the river bank, an others off amid the high grass.  When their calling began the birds were in non-breeding condition, and enlargement of the sexual glands took place near Faradje only in late December.  Eggs may be laid there in January or February, but we could find no nest.</p>
				<p>In Northern Nigeria and Darfur scops owls of the race <taxonName idx_name="Otus senegalensis senegalensis">senegalensis</taxonName> nest in April and May, in holes in limbs of large trees.  Two to four white eggs are laid, measuring 31&ndash;32.5 mm. &times; 25.5&ndash;26.2.</p>
				<p><taxonName>Otus senegalensis</taxonName> must be almost entirely insectivorous.  From the four stomachs that contained food we took pieces of a mantis, a cricket two green orthoptera, and bits of other insects, as well as a single feather probably from the owl itself.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;Western side of Lake Tanganyika and doubtless the Ruzizi Valley, extending to the Upper Katanga and probably into western Tanganyika Territory.  Whether the birds of the coastal region of East Africa belong to this form is not at all sure.</p>
				<p><taxonName idx_name="Otus senegalensis graueri">O. s. graueri</taxonName> differs from <taxonName idx_name="Otus senegalensis ugand&aelig;">ugand&aelig;</taxonName> in having the crown, back, rump, and lesser wing-coverts more heavily washed with rufous, while the rufous markings on the basal half of breast-feathers are paler and less extensive.  Wing averaging shorter, 126&ndash;136 mm.</p>
				<p>In the Congo Museum there are now nine skins of <taxonName idx_name="Otus senegalensis graueri">graueri</taxonName>, from &quot;Ruzizi-Kivu,&quot; Baraka, Mawagongo, Tembwe, and Kiambi.  They are all surprisingly similar in general coloration.  At Baraka Grauer collected two examples, which I have examined.  Looking again at Neave&apos;s two specimens from the Upper Katanga, I find that they are not <taxonName idx_name="Otus senegalensis hendersonii">hendersonii</taxonName>, but agree better with the series of <taxonName idx_name="Otus senegalensis graueri">graueri</taxonName> in Tervueren.</p>
				<p>Grauer&apos;s scops owl is found in savannas with a plentiful supply of rather small trees, and resembles <taxonName idx_name="Otus senegalensis ugand&aelig;">ugand&aelig;</taxonName> in its way of life.  Its call, however, is distinctly hoarser, and in this it agrees with the scops owls living east of Lake Victoria&mdash;to whatever race they may belong.  When I visited East Africa in 1926 I was already familiar with the voice of <taxonName idx_name="Otus senegalensis ugand&aelig;">ugand&aelig;</taxonName>, which has a slight metallic resonance, and only a faint &quot;stutter&quot; at the start.  To my surprise, the birds heard near Ikoma and the Grumeti River in northern Tanganyika Territory called more hoarsely, or as it sounded to me, &quot;k-k-kaw.&quot;  On reaching Uganda I had my impression verified as I listened again to <taxonName idx_name="Otus senegalensis ugand&aelig;">ugand&aelig;</taxonName>, and this resonant type of note was heard in a few places along the eastern Congo border south to the Rutshuru Plain.</p>
				<p>Again the difference was noticed when at two places in the lower Ruzizi Valley I listened to hoarser calls from the scops owls.  Finally at Lueba I succeeded in shooting a male that had this same less resonant voice.  It was sitting at dusk in a thickly foliaged tree not far
<pb n="375" id="t000120-p00381c.tif"/> from the lake shore, and two others with similar voices were heard the same evening.  Unfortunately, the focusing flashlight is of little use in locating these scops owls, for I have never been able to see any glow from their eyes.</p>
				<p>In the Katanga, Neave wrote, this scops owl seemed to be not uncommon, but was easily overlooked.  It appeared to have a preference for thinly wooded hillsides.  I have heard one calling in the evening from a tree in the center of Elisabethville.  This was on August 17. The day before, in the middle of the afternoon, one was heard in the savanna woods a few miles to the eastward.  In neither case could I see the bird, and the voice was not so clear and resonant as in the Uelle district.</p>
				<p>Dr. Bequaert tells me that the specimen he and Dr. Rodhain obtained at Sankisia on September 30, 1911, had the ovary enlarged though breeding.  The gonads of my male from Lueba on July 25 were somewhat enlarged, indicating that breeding would soon take place probably in the latter half of the dry season.  The stomach contained only pieces of insects.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;Angola from the Benguella Plateau to Ndala Tando, to the vicinity of Landana, and the savannas of the southwestern Congo.  This is a very grayish race as compared with <taxonName idx_name="Otus senegalensis graueri">graueri</taxonName> or <taxonName idx_name="Otus senegalensis ugand&aelig;">ugand&aelig;</taxonName>, finely vermiculated throughout, and with narrower blackish markings on the upperparts, and only pale cinnamon-buff on the basal part of breast feathers.

				<p>The validity of this eastern race of scops owl is denied by Meinertzhagen,<note n="1">1922, Ibis, p. 55.</note> who ascribes its supposedly grayer coloration to individual variation, and finds the difference in size so slight as to be almost negligible.

				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;Senegal to Khartoum, Abyssinia,
<pb n="377" id="t000120-p00383c.tif"/> and Somaliland; south through eastern Africa to Natal and the Orange River; also to Angola and the savannas of the southern Congo.

				<p><taxonName idx_name="Otus leucotis leucotis">O. l. leucotis</taxonName> extends across the whole Sudan and to northern Kenya Colony, occurring also in the northern savannas of the Congo.

				<p>In the savannas of the northern Uelle I believe that <taxonName idx_name="Otus leucotis leucotis">Otus l. leucotis</taxonName> is not rare.  At Garamba and to the east of Faradje I heard several times a rather high-pitched &quot;cu-hoo&quot; or &quot;cu-coo&quot; which I attributed to this owl, and my" identification has been confirmed by Admiral Lynes.<note n="2">1925, Ibis, p. 390.</note>
				</p>
				<p>On December 18, 1912, I was shown a stick-nest 14 feet up in a small tree, on which sat an incubating bird.  By ill fortune I failed to kill it outright, and it never came back.  The two white eggs remained unbroken for two weeks.  In other regions of Africa the white-faced scops owl has been found breeding in holes in trees as well as in old nests of <taxonName>Bubalornis albirostris</taxonName>.</p>
				<p>Our only specimen from the Uelle was reared in captivity.  On January 17, 1913, a native brought us two young from an old nest of dry twigs, built no doubt by a hawk or plantain-eater in a small savanna tree.  One young bird was replaced in the nest, but it disappeared the following night, and the parents were never seen.  The other was kept for a month till it reached adult size.  Sometimes it uttered a low hoarse note, and when demanding food it repeated a more impatient call.</p>
				<p>Eggs of this typical race from Nigeria, where it breeds in February and March, measure 36.6&ndash;37.3 mm. &times; 30.3&ndash;31.3.<note n="3">Bannerman, 1933, `Birds Trop. W. Afr.,' III, p. 26.</note>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;From the Orange River and Natal north to the Portuguese Congo and savannas of the Gaboon, Kasai district, Katanga, northern Tanganyika Territory, and the Loita district of Kenya Colony.  I have collected a female near Ikoma, east of Lake Victoria, sitting on an open stick-nest with two eggs, on April 17.  The Berlin Museum has a skin from Donje Erok, west of Kilimanjaro.</p>
				<p>Within the Congo it comes north only to the southern edge of the equatorial forest, but is rather common in the Kasai district.  Father Callewaert has sent us several young, just out of the nest, which were collected in June, July, and August, so it is a dry-season breeder like the northern race in the Uelle.  The Congo Museum has a well-grown nestling from Leopoldville in August.  In South Africa the white eggs are said to be laid in sets of two, and to measure 39.4&ndash;40.6 mm. &times; 33&ndash;34.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;Liberia, Gold Coast, forested southern Cameroon, the Upper Congo forest eastward to the Uelle and Ituri districts, and south in the gallery forests of the Kasai to Luluabourg.  This is a forest-dwelling owl, apparently wholly insectivorous.</p>
				<p>Although Lang and I did not secure a specimen, we took from a native hat at Avakubi two feathers since" identified as a primary and a rectrix of this rare owl.  In addition to two adults taken by Dr. Schouteden at Luebo the Congo Museum now has half-grown nestlings from Lukolela (March 25), Elisabetha, and Poko (May 21).</p>
				<p>Such young birds can readily be" identified by the pattern of their remiges, though these are somewhat more rufous distally than those of adults.  The soft feathers of back and scapulars are cinnamon-rufous, with whitish tips and faint subterminal brownish bars.

				<p>Adults are rather variable in color, but always rufous.  Some have chestnut shaft-streaks on lower underparts, others have them black. Wings, 235&ndash;280 mm.  Mr. Bates<note n="1">1929, B. B. O. C., XLIX, p. 90.</note> has proposed a new genus, <taxonName>Jubula</taxonName>,

				<p>SPECIMENS.&mdash;Lukolela, &male;, Dec. 17.  Batama, &male;, Sept. 17.  Medje, &female;, Sept. 12; &female; juv., Sept. 15.</p>
				<p>ADULTS.&mdash;Iris chrome-yellow to nearly cadmium (&male;), bill light grayish green, approaching yellow distally, cere greenish buff; toes yellowish, claws black with gray bases.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;West coast of Africa from Sierra Leone to the
<pb n="380" id="t000120-p00386c.tif"/> Gaboon and Lower Congo, and inland as far as the Ituri Forest, indicating that it inhabits the whole of the solid lowland forest in the Congo.</p>
				<p>Apparently nowhere numerous, it is still known from only about eight localities in the Belgian Congo.  One was shot by Lang in a tree in the forest near Batama, by day.  At Medje on September 12 a female was trapped by the natives, and on dissection was seen to have laid recently. Three days later they brought us a young nestling, plainly of this same species, said to have been found on the ground near the spot where the old bird had been caught.  The latter&apos;s breast is somewhat stained from the red soil, as though possibly her nest really was on the ground.</p>
				<p>The natal down is white; the first plumage (mesoptyles) white with a wash of pale cinnamon on the upperparts, and barred with blackish brown above and below, save for the facial disc, abdomen, and legs. Our specimen is so young that its tail does not yet show, still the irides were already yellow, the bill greenish, toes yellow, and claws black.</p>
				<p>A half-grown nestling in the Congo Museum was secured at Buta in April, another with slightly longer wings on May 7, and a third with wings three-fourths grown at the same locality in October.  From the vicinity of Lisala there is also a fledgling taken in May.  So breeding is not restricted to the dry period and may perhaps take place throughout the year.</p>
				<p>The light barring and mottling of the upperparts are more extensive in our adult female of <taxonName idx_name="Bubo leucostictus">B. leucostictus</taxonName> than in either male, but there is no great sexual difference in size.  Bannerman (1933) gave the wing-length of this owl as 305&ndash;330 mm., tail 178&ndash;205.  Nine skins from the northeastern Congo forest have wings 290&ndash;310 mm., tails 188&ndash;204.  A mounted specimen supposedly from the Lower Congo has wing 346 mm., tail 228, and is darker in color than any of the others.  <taxonName idx_name="Bubo leucostictus">B. leucostictus</taxonName> is strikingly weak-footed; and it certainly cannot be referred to <taxonName>Huhua</taxonName>, the type of which is <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Huhua nipalensis">H. nipalensis</taxonName> Hodgson</taxon>, an extremely powerful bird.</p>
				<p>No owl-note was ever heard which might have come from the present species; and even the specimen I shot at Lukolela, sitting in a tall tree on the edge of the forest, late in the dusk, was perfectly silent.</p>
				<p>As compared with the bolder, stronger species of <taxonName>Bubo</taxonName> this weak-footed owl seems to occupy a place comparable to that of <taxonName>Aviceda</taxonName> among the hawks, being perhaps exclusively insectivorous.  In three stomachs we found only insects, especially beetles.  Bates likewise
<pb n="381" id="t000120-p00387c.tif"/> reported<note n="1">1904, Ibis, p. 603.</note> that of five specimens he examined all had eaten insects&mdash; chiefly Orthoptera&mdash;and that he watched one at dusk catching cockroaches in the air.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;Cape Province to southern Arabia, Eritrea, the Sudan, and French Guinea, but never in heavy equatorial forest or in dense mountain forests.  <taxonName idx_name="Bubo africanus africanus">B. a. africanus</taxonName> occupies the southern half of Africa, north to the Loango Coast, the southern borders of the Congo forest, Lake Edward, and central Kenya Colony.  Its wings measure about 310&ndash;360 mm. and its iris is deep yellow.  <taxonName idx_name="Bubo africanus cinerascens">B. a. cinerascens</taxonName> is smaller, wings about 295&ndash;328 mm., and has the iris dark brown.  The barring of its underparts is generally finer, upperparts more vermiculated and grayer, white spotting of hind-neck and dusky patches on breast-feathers much less pronounced.  This is the Sudanese race, extending south to the northern edge of the equatorial forest, to the southern shores of Lake Albert, and northern Kenya Colony.  <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Bubo africanus milesi">B. a. milesi</taxonName> Sharpe</taxon> is a rather tawny race, restricted to southern Arabia. According to Bates its iris is yellow.</p>
				<p>Unusually brownish examples of <taxonName idx_name="Bubo africanus africanus">africanus</taxonName> are not rare, and the type of <taxon><taxonName>Bubo ascalaphus troth&aelig;</taxonName> Reichenow</taxon><note n="2">1906, O. Mb., p. 10 (Keetmannshoop, S. W. Africa).</note> was an aberrant individual tinged to an unusual degree with cinnamon.  The majority are grayish.
<pb n="382" id="t000120-p00388c.tif"/> The wings of nineteen skins of <taxonName idx_name="Bubo africanus africanus">africanus</taxonName> from the southern and eastern Congo measure 310&ndash;349 mm.  A specimen from Zambi on the Lower Congo has the wing only 320 mm., but its color pattern is that of <taxonName idx_name="Bubo africanus africanus">africanus</taxonName>.</p>
				<p>The spotted horned owl appears to be rather common in the Kasai, and Neave mentioned it as by no means uncommon in the well wooded districts of the Katanga.  In the Lower Congo I saw it on several occasions, as it flew from the rocks of a steep hill near Matadi, or perched in the palms of the grasslands near Boma.  At dusk I have also watched it sitting high on the boughs of a baobab within the town of Boma.  Its call is a low double hoot, sometimes prolonged to four syllables.</p>
				<p>In the eastern Congo this southern form extends northward through the grasslands around Lake Kivu to the upper Semliki Valley.  Near the new post of Beni I shot a female with deep yellow irides and wing 345 mm. long.</p>
				<p>In southern Africa this owl lays its two eggs&mdash;or occasionally three &mdash;on the ground in a slight depression, in a hollow of the earth along a river bank, amid the rocks on a steep hillside, or even on top of a nest of <taxonName>Scopus</taxonName>.  The eggs are rounded, pure white, and measure 48.5&ndash;53 mm. by 41.7&ndash;42.5.  Breeding should begin in the Katanga toward July, for a half-grown nestling was obtained by de Witte at Kanzenze in mid-August.</p>

				<p>ADULTS.&mdash;Iris dark brown, rim of eyelids blackish red; bill black, cere dusky; skin of toes rather dark gray, claws black.</p>
				<p>NESTLING.&mdash;Iris very dark brown; bill gray, tip of lower mandible whitish; toes light bluish gray, claws dusky.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;Northeastern Africa from Eritrea to northern Kenya Colony, and westward through the grasslands north of the equatorial forest to Asben and French Guinea, possibly to the Gambia. In the northeastern Congo it inhabits the savannas of the Uelle and
<pb n="383" id="t000120-p00389c.tif"/> the west shore of Lake Albert.  I have secured a male with dark brown eyes at Kasenyi, and a female with eyes of the same color at Kichwamba in Toro.  A specimen taken by Pilette at Boga near the lower Semliki is likewise of this race.</p>
				<p>The commonest owl in the Uelle savannas is <taxonName idx_name="Bubo africanus cinerascens">B. a. cinerascens</taxonName>, which spends the day singly or in pairs, hidden among the patches of trees that grow in swampy spots.  It hunts by night far and wide, often approaching villages, and advertising its presence by a short, low hoot, which may be doubled, and which sounds as though its author were much farther off than in reality.  Another bird in the distance will often answer it; and they are not hard to see by moonlight, perching on the larger trees overlooking the bush.  All the specimens I have seen from the Uelle are grayish, but more rufescent examples from Asben and Abyssinia have been reported by Hartert.<note n="1">1924, Nov. Zool., XXXI, p. 16.</note>
				</p>
				<p>Their breeding season is very well defined: near Faradje the majority seem to lay about January 1&ndash;10, two or three being the usual brood.  During February, March, and April the natives would bring us young birds, so that we were able to observe this seasonal regularity in three successive years.  Holes in trees are usually chosen as nests, generally at a little elevation above the ground, in the larger trees of the savanna growth; but in one case (January 9, 1913) three rounded, white eggs of this horned owl had been laid on the bare earth inside the base of a hollow tree, on a level with the ground.  Through this dry part of the bush a fire had already passed, and the whole interior of the tree had rotted or been burned out, leaving several openings close to the ground.  Young birds when taken from the nest raise their wings, claw, and snap their beaks.  Dimensions of eggs, 48.4&ndash;51.5 mm. &times; 40.0&ndash;41.4.</p>
				<p>Of nine stomachs investigated five contained insects, and six the hair or bones of rats.  The rats numbered seven, the only other vertebrate found was a blind-snake (<taxonName>Typhlops sp.</taxonName>).  About a dozen beetles had been eaten, many of goodly size, one a large horned dung-beetle. We noted also many roaches, nine crickets, a grasshopper, a large moth, and one spider.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;From the Gold Coast eastward through the Cameroon, as well as on the island of Fernando Po, to the Mayombe, the Ubangi River, and the Ituri district, where Grauer has collected it at Beni, on the eastern edge of the forest.  The Congo Museum has an adult from Lusambo.  The wings of seven specimens from the Congo measure 280&ndash;316 mm.<note n="1"><taxonName>Bubo vosseleri</taxonName> Reichenow of Usambara, though regarded by Sclater as a race of <taxonName idx_name="Bubo poensis">B. poensis</taxonName>, is a distinct species, I am told by Professor Stresemann.</note>
				</p>
				<p>About Avakubi <taxonName>Bubo poensis</taxonName> is a forest-haunting owl, not frequently seen, and I have never even heard a note that I could attribute to it. I shot one at dusk from a tree near a small forest-village, where we also heard the loud call of <taxonName>Strix woodfordii nuchalis</taxonName>.  Another was found in the forest during the day through its being scolded by a band of small birds.  The female killed on August 12 showed a slight enlargement of the ovary; the males, in March and June, were clearly non-breeding.</p>
				<p>In juvenal (mesoptyle) plumage the young of <taxonName idx_name="Bubo poensis">poensis</taxonName> is much more buffy than that of <taxonName idx_name="Bubo leucostictus">leucostictus</taxonName>, and more abundantly barred with blackish. The facial disc is conspicuously outlined with black, and the remiges and rectrices are barred very much as in the adult.</p>
				<p>Only two stomachs had food in them; one the remains of insects, largely Orthoptera; the other, bones of a small bird and of a frog, also pieces of a large round millipede.  Bates reported a small lemur (<taxonName>Galago</taxonName>), a mouse, a squirrel, and a fruit-bat from stomachs of this owl.</p>
				<p>It might be said that natives of this region consider owls to be birds of ill omen; yet they never worry much about them, and will wear their feathers on hats quite as readily as those of hawks, hornbills, and other birds.</p>
				<p>On the other hand, in the country around Niangara, where the feathers of a <taxonName>Scotopelia peli</taxonName> are precious as adornments, the low gruff hooting of <taxonName>Bubo lacteus</taxonName>, said Nekuma, foretells a coming death in the village; and a similar superstition is connected with the same bird by the Bakusu, who likewise fear the weird call of <taxonName>Clamator cafer</taxonName>, when occasionally it is heard at night.</p>

				<p><taxon><taxonName>Huhua shelleyi</taxonName> SHARPE AND USSHER, 1872, Ibis, p. 182</taxon> (type locality: Fantee, Gold Coast).</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;Forests of Liberia, Gold Coast, southern Cameroon, and Ituri district.  Long known from only two examples collected in Fanti, it was rediscovered in 1921 by Bates at the River Ja, Cameroon.<note n="1">Bannerman, 1923, B. B. O. C., XLIII, p. 144.</note> In 1926, Dr. Bouet<note n="2">1931, Ois. R. F. O., (N. S.) I, p. 435.</note> obtained a fourth specimen near Monrovia, Liberia.</p>
				<p>Shelley&apos;s eagle-owl certainly occurs in the Ituri as well.  Among some perplexing feathers which I took from native hats at Avakubi in 1913 there is a secondary of a large owl, easily recognized by the &quot;mothwing&quot; texture of its upper surface.  Inclusive of quill this feather measures 306 mm., and is slightly larger than secondaries of <taxonName>Bubo lacteus</taxonName>.  From corresponding feathers of <taxonName idx_name="Bubo lacteus">lacteus</taxonName> it differs in its more regular and more numerous dark bars, which extend completely across the inner web.  There can be no doubt that it is a secondary of <taxonName>Bubo shelleyi</taxonName>.  Another black-barred feather secured at the same time may be a primary from the same bird, but its basal portion is lacking.</p>
				<p>Feathers worn on native hats usually come from no great distance, and I feel certain that <taxonName>Bubo shelleyi</taxonName> will eventually be found in scattered localities in the Upper Congo forest.</p>

				<p>NESTLING.&mdash;Iris blackish, bill light blue-gray, toes light bluish gray.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;From Senegal, the northern territories of the Gold Coast, Darfur, and northern Abyssinia to Cape Province, but never in the heavy lowland forest of western and central Africa.  It is found in the northern, eastern, and southern savannas of the Congo, often rather close to the forest border.</p>
				<p>From the Lower Congo there was no record except that of Dubois (1905); but Paul Janssens tells me he shot one at Sumba in Angola, just south of the lower Congo River.  Dr. Schouteden believed he saw this owl at Basongo, in the northern Kasai, but did not collect it there. Father Callewaert has obtained several specimens at Luluabourg.  In the Kivu district it ascends to the highlands, for I have collected one in rather open woodland at 6700 feet, four miles north of Kibati.  Yet it is not found in the denser mountain forests.  In addition to the localities mentioned above, the following are represented by specimens in the Congo Museum: Tembwe on Lake Tanganyika, Kiambi on Luvua River, Inkongo on Sankuru River, and Mokabe-Kasari and the Kapiri Plateau in the Katanga.</p>
				<p>In the regions where it is found I have heard two kinds of notes that I credit to it.  One is a series of low, gruff, hooting sounds, with considerable carrying power, repeated at intervals; the other a weaker whistling sound, also given again and again, likewise at night.  I made sure about the second note by sending after it a keen native hunter, who soon brought back one of these owls, a specimen not quite mature; and I find both notes described from South Africa by Major Stevenson-Hamilton.<note n="1">1917, `Animal Life in Africa,' III, p. 42.</note>
				</p>
				<p>In October, 1911, I came upon a pair roosting by day in a forest patch between Faradje and Aba.  They were not very shy, but the trees were so very high as to keep them almost out of danger from my shot-gun.</p>
				<p>South of Niangara, in November, the people of Okondo brought us a young gray eagle-owl they had taken from a nest.  We later secured both parents, and found they had been rearing their single offspring on a structure of sticks that must have been set up by some other bird.  It was in the fork of a rather small tree standing in the savanna, near the edge of some woods, and only 30 feet from the ground.  In other parts of Africa these large eagle-owls have usually been found utilizing nests of sticks, but I doubt if they construct them.  Occasionally they occupy a hollow tree.  In Southern Rhodesia nestlings have been
<pb n="387" id="t000120-p00393c.tif"/> taken in April, and in Angola in July.  The eggs are plain white, somewhat rounded, measuring 54&ndash;64.2 mm. &times; 44&ndash;50.  Sets of two are the rule, but there may sometimes be three, or only one.</p>
				<p>Small mammals up to the size of hares, and birds as large as guinea-fowl are said to be preyed upon; but much smaller creatures are likewise taken.  In the three stomachs we examined there were several beetles, a cricket, and bones of a frog (or toad), as well as of a fruit-bat.  Heuglin also mentioned fruit-bats in this connection.</p>

				<p>SPECIMENS.&mdash;Niapu, 2 &male;, Dec. 8, 12; &female;, Dec. 6; &female; juv., Dec. 2.  Niangara, 2 &female;, Apr. 26, Dec. 6.</p>
				<p>ADULT FEMALE.&mdash;Iris dark brown, rim of eyelids dirty yellowish; cere and both mandibles dull light yellowish green, dusky along cutting edges; feet brownish yellow, claws light gray, shading to blackish at tips.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;Obtained once in Liberia, but occurring mainly from southern Cameroon east to the Upper Uelle district, and also on the southern side of the equatorial forest from the Gaboon, Landana, and perhaps northern Angola east to the Kasai district and possibly the Manyema.  In the Congo it has never been found in the unbroken area of lowland forest, but only along its edges, or in gallery forests.  Father Callewaert sent two specimens to the American Museum from the vicinity of Luluabourg, and there is one adult in the Congo Museum from Kunungu near Bolobo.  The species may be expected in the Mayombe.</p>
				<p>One of our examples from Niangara was shot during the afternoon in some woods bordering a stream.  The others, including the nestling bird, were secured through native hunters.  One which we kept alive called several times at night, giving either a half-dozen short &quot;hu&apos;s&quot; in rapid succession, or a protracted quavering hoot.</p>

				<p>In this small series from the Uelle the males are distinctly more rufous above than females, especially on sides of neck, and more tinged with rusty on lower breast and flanks.<note n="1">The illustration in `Cat.

				<p>The natal down of <taxonName>Scotopelia bouvieri</taxonName> is white.  It can still be seen adhering to the tips of the feathers in our nestling bird, which has the tail half-grown and is clothed in the loose &quot;mesoptyle&quot; plumage.  The rectrices, remiges, and alula-quills are more cinnamon than in the adult; the underparts white with very fine, fuscous shaft-streaks.  The upperparts from crown backward have a pale cinnamon wash, heavier shaft-streaks, and on the wing-coverts mottling or broken barring of fuscous. Facial discs nearly pure white.  The Congo Museum has two young from Buta in this same plumage.  One of them is much more cinnamon-rufous
<pb n="389" id="t000120-p00395u.tif"/> on back, breast, and wing-coverts.  This example has wings and tail full-grown, and was obtained on February 11.  So eggs would seem to be laid in the Uelle toward November and December.  The nest is unknown.</p>
				<p>No food was found in the stomachs we examined, but Bates has recorded that birds from the Cameroon had eaten small fishes, prawns, and a small bird.</p>

				<p>SPECIMENS.&mdash;Avakubi, &female;, Aug. 21. Faradje, &female; (?), Apr. 2.</p>
				<p>ADULT FEMALE.&mdash;Iris very dark brown, rim of eyelids gray; bill black with mandible light gray beneath, cere light gray, slightly bluish; feet pinkish white with a faint tinge of yellow, claws light gray.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;Senegal, the Shari River district, and Eritrea, south to eastern Cape Province.  While found along large rivers in the Congo forest, it seems to be more common in savanna countries where the streams are fringed with trees.</p>
				<p>Although Zedlitz<note n="1">1908, O. Mb., p. 172.</note> proposed to divide this species in three races, it is very doubtful if his East African race, <taxonName idx_name="Scotopelia peli fischeri">fischeri</taxonName>, can be upheld.  His dark-colored form, <taxonName idx_name="Scotopelia peli salvago-raggii">S. p. salvago-raggii</taxonName> from the Tacazz&eacute; River in Eritrea, is said to be represented only by the type.<note n="2">Grant and M.-Praed, 1937, B. B. O. C., LVII, pp. 158, 159, deny the validity of any races.</note>
				</p>
				<p>Although so seldom collected, Pel&apos;s Fishing-Owl probably occurs throughout the lowlands of the Belgian Congo.  On my way up the Congo River, near Ukaturaka Island, I saw a large owl by moonlight which was almost certainly of this species.  Next we heard of it among the Mangbetu just south of Niangara.  They considered this &quot;N&eacute;-bi&quot; so noble a bird that none save the chiefs and their immediate relatives were allowed to wear its plumage.  It was said to be found mainly along the Bomokandi River.</p>
				<p>Our specimen from Faradje was secured by native boatmen as it flew from tree to tree along a tributary to the Dungu River.  Somehow they caught it alive, and plucked out all its larger quills, so I preserved it as a skeleton.</p>
				<pb n="390" id="t000120-p00396c.tif"/>
				<p>In January, 1914, I found a few molted feathers of <taxonName idx_name="Scotopelia peli">S. peli</taxonName> lying on the shore of a small wooded island in the Ituri River above Avakubi. Several evenings were spent watching for it there, but in vain.  Not far away, in May of the same year, Nekuma saw one of these fine birds, but it was only in August that he was able to shoot our second specimen. Its stomach contained the bones and head of a catfish, <taxonName>Synodontis</taxonName>. The wing of this female measured 404 mm., tail 220, culmen from cere 38, metatarsus 70.</p>
				<p>The powerful feet of this fishing-owl remind one of an osprey&apos;s, the more so because the lower surface of all the toes is covered with small spiny scales.  <taxonName idx_name="Scotopelia bouvieri">S. bouvieri</taxonName> has much smaller feet, likewise spiculate beneath.</p>
				<p>Although I traveled several hundred miles by canoe on rivers in the northeastern Congo, never did I see <taxonName>Scotopelia peli</taxonName> along their banks by day.  The only note I could attribute to it was a single deep and resonant &quot;Hmmm,&quot; which I heard repeated several times one night along the Ituri River in October.  But a young bird in captivity in the Staten Island Zo&ouml;logical Park during 1936 gave hoots that were not unlike those of many other owls.</p>
				<p>This young bird was brought from South Africa while still in juvenal (&quot;mesoptyle&quot;) plumage.  Dubois&apos;s specimen from the &quot;Lower Congo&quot; is in that same plumage, with remiges and rectrices not yet fully grown. It is entered in the register of the Congo Museum without any note as to its origin, but it may have been collected by Cabra in the Lower Congo.</p>
				<p>In its &quot;mesoptyle&quot; plumage the young <taxonName>Scotopelia peli</taxonName> is mainly pale cinnamon, with some blackish bristly feathers on loral region; scapulars and greater wing-coverts with dusky barring, and wing and tail-quills very like those of adults.</p>
				<p>In Southern Rhodesia Carlisle is said to have found a set of four white eggs during September in a large stick-nest, like an eagle&apos;s, in a high tree along a river bank.  The eggs measured 54 &times; 44 mm.<note n="1">Priest, 1934, `Birds S. Rhodesia,' II, p. 434.</note>

				<p>SPECIMEN.&mdash;Dungu, &male;, June 6.</p>
				<p>ADULT MALE.&mdash;Iris yellow, rim of eyelids dark greenish; bill light green; skin of toes yellow, claws dusky.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;From Senegal to Abyssinia, through the open countries north of the forest belt; then through eastern Africa and the lowland savannas of the eastern Congo to the Orange River; westward also to Angola.  Not known from the Lower Congo, the Kasai district, or the highlands of the Kivu; but the Congo Museum has specimens from Kabalo on the Lualaba River, Funda Biabo, Kinda, and Lake Musolo in the eastern Lulua district, Kilwa on Lake Moero, and Tembwe on Lake Tanganyika, in addition to other localities cited above.  At Baraka the pearl-spotted owlet must be common.  From the region about Lake Edward I have seen only Pilette&apos;s specimen from Molekera.</p>
				<p>In the Uelle district during two and a half years I saw but a single example, sitting on a small leafless tree in the full glare of the sun at 10 A.M.  We never heard its notes, which have been described as consisting of &quot;an ascent of the octave in clear distinct notes, and then a slurred descent in one prolonged note.&quot;<note n="1">E.C. Chubb, 1909, Ibis, p. 149.</note>
				</p>
				<p>Although there is much variation in color, some specimens being grayish brown above, others more rufous, two distinct color-phases
<pb n="392" id="t000120-p00398c.tif"/> cannot be distinguished.  The crown-spots widen occasionally almost to bars.  Specimens with finely streaked or unspotted crown appear to be young.</p>
				<p>The breeding season in the Uelle is likely to be about April, as it is in Northern Nigeria and the Gambia.<note n="1">Bannerman, 1933, `Birds Trop. W. Afr.,' III, p. 31.</note>  In the southeastern Congo eggs are probably laid toward September.  Nests are in holes in trees which have usually been excavated by barbets or woodpeckers; and sets are of two to four white eggs, measuring 30&ndash;32 mm. &times; 24&ndash;26.5.<note n="2">Roberts, 1913, Journ.

				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;Eastern Cape Province north to Kenya Colony, the upper Semliki Valley, southeastern Congo, and Angola.  Not known from the Kasai district or northwestern Angola.</p>
				<p><taxonName idx_name="Glaucidium capense capense">G. c. capense</taxonName> is usually regarded as ranging from South Africa to Angola, Katanga, Marungu, and Unyamwezi, but Austin Roberts recognizes two other races, ngamiense and rufum<note n="3">Gunning and Roberts, 1911, Ann. Transvaal Mus., III, p. 111 (Boror, Port E. Afr.).</note> within that area, restricting capense to Eastern Cape Province, Natal, and Zululand.  <taxonName idx_name="Glaucidium capense ngamiense">G. c. ngamiense</taxonName> is said to differ from <taxonName idx_name="Glaucidium capense capense">capense</taxonName> in having dark brown bars on the head, instead of red-chestnut-brown.  It seems to range from Ngamiland north to the southern Lulua district.  <taxonName idx_name="Glaucidium capense rufum">G. c. rufum</taxonName> is somewhat lighter and perhaps a little more ruddy above than <taxonName idx_name="Glaucidium capense ngamiense">ngamiense</taxonName>, extending apparently from the lower Zambesi to the region of Lake Tanganyika.  <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Glaucidium capense scheffleri">G. c. scheffleri</taxonName> Neumann</taxon>, of East Africa from Kilosa and Bagamoyo north to Gilgil and Sokoke in Kenya Colony, has the back of a still warmer brown, with light barring weakly developed.  <taxonName idx_name="Glaucidium capense castaneum">G. c. castaneum</taxonName> has the back even more reddish brown, only faintly barred with light rufous, and lesser wing-coverts uniform deep reddish brown.</p>
				<p>At Dilolo in early September G. F. de Witte collected a series of twelve specimens which I here refer to <taxonName idx_name="Glaucidium capense capense">ngamiense</taxonName>, They are very uniform in coloration, with backs dark brown rather boldly barred with buff, and crowns dark grayish brown barred with white.  From birds taken near Lake Tanganyika they differ in their darker, more contrasted coloration.</p>
				<p>The barred owlet is an inhabitant of savannas, where it spends the
<pb n="393" id="t000120-p00399c.tif"/> day in scattered trees, sometimes sitting in plain view, sometimes hiding in the densest foliage.  Austin Roberts says it utters a croaking or rattling noise when alarmed during daylight.  Its food is known to include caterpillars, grasshoppers, and mice.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;If this race is valid, it extends from the lower Zambesi Valley to the interior of Tanganyika Territory, the Marungu district of the Belgian Congo, and Lake Moero.  I have been unable to secure any specimen for comparison from the area to which Austin Roberts restricts <taxonName idx_name="Glaucidium capense capense">G. c. capense</taxonName>, and must assume that he is justified in separating <taxonName idx_name="Glaucidium capense rufum">rufum</taxonName>.  But I have compared specimens from Mpala, Kakoma, and Unyamwezi with two from Beira and Mozambique Province and found no difference.  Two skins from Lukonzolwa on Lake Moero and Fort Jameson in Northern Rhodesia seem also to agree.  When he described <taxonName idx_name="Glaucidium capense scheffleri">scheffleri</taxonName>, Professor Neumann took such birds to represent <taxonName idx_name="Glaucidium capense capense">G. c. capense</taxonName>.</p>
				<p>In the mountains of Marungu B&ouml;hm found this owlet very common, and believed it to be breeding in the first half of August.  He described the birds as calling to their mates in broad daylight with buzzing and chirping sounds which grew louder and more rapid.  In February, G. F. de Witte collected a molting individual at Lukonzolwa.</p>
				<p>A nest of the barred owlet discovered by Austin Roberts<note n="1">1911, Journ, S. Afr. Orn. Union, VII, p. 71.</note> in Portuguese East Africa on September 12 was in a hollow of a broken tree-trunk.

				<p><taxonName idx_name="Glaucidium tephronotum medje">Glaucidium t. medje</taxonName> is known from only three localities in the northeastern Congo, but it must occur throughout that section of the lowland forest.  The only example that I shot myself was seen near Medje at 3 o'clock in the afternoon of a rainy day, while the sky was very much overcast.  It flew across a forest path in front of me, and luckily alighted on a horizontal liana not too far away.  Until I picked it up I thought I had seen a small <taxonName>Accipiter</taxonName>.</p>
				<p>Two of the specimens secured by Lang through natives were said to have been caught in holes of trees, and one was certainly taken alive. The birds taken on May 7 and July 7 were noted as not in breeding condition, the other two were probably not.  From Buta the Congo Museum has an adult male and a young bird with rectrices not fully grown. The date of the latter was not recorded.</p>
				<p>In two stomachs examined there were a rat, a hemipter, and a mantis.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;From eastern Cape Province north to Abyssinia, the Azande country of the southern Sudan, Mt. Cameroon, Southern Nigeria, hinterland of the Ivory Coast, and Sierra Leone.  It is wanting in the drier parts of Southwest Africa, but extends through the equatorial forests.</p>
				<p><taxonName idx_name="Strix woodfordii woodfordii">S. w. woodfordii</taxonName> of South Africa extends northward to Nyasaland, Northeast Rhodesia, and the Upper Katanga.  Eastern Africa has two races, which can be separated only provisionally, for they may represent individual rather than geographic differences.  Sclater restricts <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Strix woodfordii nigricantior">S. w. nigricantior</taxonName> (Sharpe)</taxon> to the coastal region, and <taxonName idx_name="Strix woodfordii suahelica">S. w. suahelica</taxonName> to the interior of Tanganyika Territory and Kenya Colony, and Ruwenzori. It may occur also in the highlands of the Kivu.  <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Strix woodfordii umbrina">S. w. umbrina</taxonName> (Heuglin)</taxon> is the Abyssinian form, while the remainder of the range in central and western Africa is occupied by <taxonName idx_name="Strix woodfordii nuchalis">S. w. nuchalis</taxonName>.  Sharpe&apos;s <taxonName idx_name="Strix woodfordii bohndorffi">bohndorffi</taxonName> seems synonymous with <taxonName idx_name="Strix woodfordii nuchalis">nuchalis</taxonName>.</p>
				<p>The typical race is relatively dull brown, usually with considerable fine barring or vermiculation of buff on the upperparts, in addition to more or less white spotting.  The light bars on the tail are broad and conspicuous, but the brown barring of the underparts not very heavy.</p>
				<p>In the general region of the Katanga Neave noted that <taxonName idx_name="Strix woodfordii woodfordii">woodfordii</taxonName> was not uncommon, but difficult to obtain.  It frequents patches of dense forest, usually on the banks of streams.  At Lukonzolwa de Witte obtained one specimen for the Congo Museum, at Kasenga four, and at Kansenia two.  One of the Kansenia skins is unusually rufous, the other dark brown.  A rufous example, plainly of this race, was collected at Elisabethville by Dr. Richard.</p>
				<p>In Natal A.D. Miller twice found these wood-owls nesting in a hollow at the top of a dead tree-stub, on September 24 and October 21. Each time there was a single white egg.  They measured 44.4 &times; 35.5 mm. and 46.5 &times; 38.1 mm.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;Presumably from Tanganyika Territory and the interior of Kenya Colony westward to Uganda, the slopes of Ruwenzori, the Kivu district, and the highlands northwest of Baraka.  <taxonName idx_name="Strix woodfordii suahelica">S. w. suahelica</taxonName> is often rather similar in color-pattern to the typical race, but seems more variable.  Some examples are not unlike <taxonName idx_name="Strix woodfordii nuchalis">nuchalis</taxonName>.  Its status in the Congo is doubtful, for there are scarcely any specimens from the eastern highlands.</p>
				<p>In the Congo Museum I found only two skins, from &quot;Kivu&quot; (Pauwels) and Biogo (Bonnevie), which are perhaps <taxonName idx_name="Strix woodfordii suahelica">suahelica</taxonName>.  The British Museum expedition obtained an example above 6000 feet on east Ruwenzori. On the western side of Ruwenzori I did not hear this owl; but in a native hut at Kalongi, 7000 feet, we found a dried head of the species impaled on a stick.  At Lukumi camp on Mt. Karisimbi, 12,000 feet, one called repeatedly during a moonlit night, and was finally seen in a heath tree with the aid of an electric flashlight.  Unfortunately it escaped.  Near Behungi, at 8500 feet in the Kigezi district, I followed its call without success.</p>

				<p>ADULTS.&mdash;Iris very dark brown, rim of eyelids light brown; bill yellow; toes yellow, claws black.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;From Sierra Leone, and possibly the Casamance River, eastward to the Azande country, the plateau west of L. Albert, and probably the lowland forests of Uganda.<note n="1">See van Someren, 1922, Nov. Zool., XXIX, p. 45.</note>  It occupies the whole forest of Lower Guinea, and ranges southward to Mombolo in the Benguella province of Angola, the southern Kasai, and probably the vicinity of Lake Kisale on the Lualaba.</p>
				<p>This subspecies is usually much more rufous than the others, although there is some variation in this respect, and the light vermuiculation of the upperparts is all but suppressed.  Very dark brown examples are not common.  I can see no real difference between specimens from the Uelle and those of the forested Upper and Lower Congo, and do not recognize <taxonName idx_name="Strix woodfordii bohndorffi">bohndorffi</taxonName>.<note n="2">See however M.-Praed and Grant, 1938, Ibis, pp. 333&ndash;335.</note>
				</p>
				<p>The variation in color is not dependent upon sex.  The lightest and the darkest examples in my series are both females, but the first has still a few feathers of the juvenal plumage, and it seems not impossible that the darker birds may be older, especially as the loose mesoptyle plumage is so much paler than the next succeeding.</p>
				<p>This is the common wood-owl of the greater part of the Congo, with the exception of the Upper Katanga and the highlands of the eastern border.  It loves the shade of the forest, and in the more open parts of the country to the north and south it is restricted to the denser patches of woodland.  But since it is a noisy bird its presence is easily ascertained.</p>
				<p>Two very different notes it gives, one a single, loud, and rather high-pitched hoot, the other a lower &quot;hu-hu, t'hu-u t'hu.&quot;  They are repeated at varying intervals; and not infrequently both are heard, coming from slightly different directions, so native saying in the Uelle has it
<pb n="399" id="t000120-p00405c.tif"/> that the first mentioned is the male&apos;s, the second the reproachful tones of his mate.  I once kept a live female in a basket overnight, and heard from it notes like the lower reiterated hoots, yet it seems more likely that they are generally produced by the male.</p>
				<p>One evening near Niangara a pair of these owls came and occupied the trees over our tent, giving both kinds of calls.  They sat a little apart, one invariably giving the single higher hoot, but the other varied its lower syllables with a single low hoot.  At first we could only see the birds as they flew back and forth against open patches of sky, but they were devoid of fear.  We had a palm-oil light burning, and finally the low-voiced individual perched within range of its illumination.  It was secured and proved to be a male.  The other bird returned again later in the night, but gave only the single, higher hoot.  This would make it very probable that the difference in voice is sexual.</p>
				<p>In the Ituri Forest, where <taxonName idx_name="Strix woodfordii nuchalis">nuchalis</taxonName> is common, it is only occasionally seen by day, in twos, or sometimes even in threes; but they seem to have no definite roosting trees.  Conditions are always like the summer of temperate regions, the foliage is dense, and the birds can wander. Hence accumulations of owl-pellets under a single tree are never to be seen.</p>
				<p>In the Upper Uelle favorable situations are more restricted in size; and where they haunt a narrow strip of forest in the gorge of some small stream they are much easier to find, for they will not leave the shelter of the high trees.  I have also seen them being mobbed by drongos and bulbuls.<note n="1"><taxonName>Dicrurus adsmilis divaricatus</taxonName> and <taxonName>Prosphorocichla scandens orientalis</taxonName>.</note>
				</p>
				<p>The female taken at Niangara, December 6, was captured on her nest in the top of a large stub, some 20 feet high, standing in cleared land.  She had but a single white egg, and her ovary gave no promise of any more.  An egg collected by Bates in the Cameroon measured 45 &times; 39.5 mm.  The fact that young birds were invariably brought singly by natives makes it likely that one egg is the rule.</p>
				<p>In the Uelle the breeding season lasts from November to April. Females with very large ovaries were taken on November 7 and December 7, a young bird ready to leave the nest was noted at Faradje on February 14, and the Congo Museum has a well-grown nestling from Buta on April 11.</p>
				<p>In the forest belt, from Avakubi northward, the season is much the same.  Young birds were brought to us in November, January, and April, so laying must begin there in October.  From Lukolela, in the southern
<pb n="400" id="t000120-p00406c.tif"/> part of the forest belt, I have seen nestlings taken on July 4, November 16, and December 17.  At Kai Bumba in the Mayombe Dr. Schouteden collected a newly hatched bird, in pure white natal down, on October 11.</p>
				<p>South of the forest, at Luluabourg, Father Callewaert has obtained nestlings on June 11, July 2, August 1, and September 10.  At Kabambaie Dr. Schouteden preserved a young bird with remiges three-fourths grown on October 11.  These dates are about the reverse of those in the Uelle, so the young are reared mainly during the dry season.</p>
				<p>There is considerable variation in the first fluffy plumage of the young, but it is usually rather rufous, the feathers of upperparts conspicuously tipped with white, while those beneath are more apt to be barred with brown and white.  Remiges and rectrices are rather like those of the adult.</p>
				<p>Twelve stomachs of <taxonName idx_name="Strix woodfordii nuchalis">Strix w. nuchalis</taxonName> were examined, 10 containing insects.  There were vertebrates in only four, consisting of 2 mice, a small bird, and a frog (bones).  Among the insects noted were: numbers of beetles (in 5 stomachs), several grasshoppers, 1 cricket, 2 mantises, 1 large roach, 3 cicadas, and 12 small green caterpillars (these last from a single owl).  Insects far outweighed the other food.</p>

				<p><taxonName idx_name="Asio capensis capensis">A. c. capensis</taxonName> is widely distributed in the southern Congo, though not yet known from the Kasai district.  In addition to the specimen from Kisantu the Congo Museum now has one from Mutombo Mukulu in the Lomami district, and one from Kalembelembe near the northwest side of Lake Tanganyika.  Conover and Zimmer collected two for the Field Museum at Katobwe, 30 miles north of Bukama.  The marshowl seems not to inhabit the highlands of the Kivu or the lowland savannas of the Uelle.</p>
				<p>In the region of Lake Bangweolo and the Upper Katanga, according to Neave, this owl is not uncommon about large swamps and other suitable localities.  It appears to be partially diurnal in habits.  According to South African observers, it often goes in small parties of five or six, and seeks concealment during the day amid rushes and long grass.  Their prey includes frogs, lizards, mice, and aquatic insects. The cry is not a hoot, but a harsh screech.</p>
				<p>The nest is a depression hidden by a clump of reeds or grass, and lined with a few dry rushes.  Two to four white eggs are laid, which measure 40&ndash;43.5 mm. &times; 32&ndash;35.</p>

				<p>Dr. Hartert<note n="2">1913, `V&ouml;g. pal.

				<pb n="402" id="t000120-p00408c.tif"/>
				<p>The validity of <taxonName idx_name="Asio abyssinicus graueri">graueri</taxonName> still awaits confirmation, but it is safe to say that the species occurs on Ruwenzori.  In a native hut at Kalongi, near 7000 feet on the west side of the range, we discovered a dried head of a long-eared owl, showing the ear-tufts and other distinctive characters, though badly soiled by soot.  It was pierced by a thin stick and stuck among the rafters.  So this long-eared owl may well be expected on the other high mountains of the eastern Congo border.</p>

				<p>ADULTS.&mdash;Iris dark brown, rim of eyelids dark brown or dusky reddish; beak pale pinkish gray, claws and scales on feet dusky brownish, skin between scales whitish.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;Almost cosmopolitan, except in the colder regions and some of the equatorial forests.  Divisible&mdash;according to Hartert<note n="1">1913, `V&ouml;g. pal. Fauna,' II, pp. 1029&ndash;1040; 1929 Nov. Zool., XXXV, pp. 93&ndash;102.</note>&mdash;into at least twenty-six subspecies, some of which inhabit oceanic islands such as Samoa and the Gal&aacute;pagos.</p>
				<p>The African race of the common barn-owl, <taxonName idx_name="Tyto alba affinis">T. a. affinis</taxonName>, though ranging from the Senegal and southern Nubia all the way to the Cape,<note n="2">The form inhabiting Madagascar has slightly longer wings and has been named <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Tyto alba hypermetra">T. a. hypermetra</taxonName> Grote</taxon>.</note> is unknown within the limits of the Congo and Cameroon forests, except in the immediate vicinity of Mt. Cameroon.  Two specimens from Fernando Po in the American Museum show more contrast in the
<pb n="403" id="t000120-p00409c.tif"/> vermiculation of crown, back, and wing-coverts than those of the mainland; and I think that <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Tyto alba po&euml;nsis">T. a. po&euml;nsis</taxonName> (Fraser)</taxon><note n="1">1843, P. Z. S. Lond., pt. 10 (1842), p. 189 (Fernando Po).</note> may be a valid race. S&atilde;o Tom&eacute; is inhabited by a dark-colored form, <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Tyto alba thomensis">T. a. thomensis</taxonName> (Hartlaub)</taxon>; and Arabia has <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Tyto alba erlangeri">T. a. erlangeri</taxonName> Sclater</taxon>.</p>
				<p>Of our ten specimens of <taxonName idx_name="Tyto alba affinis">affinis</taxonName>, all with numerous spots on the underparts, four have the ground-color, from throat to legs, nearly pure white; and these I noted from dissection as certainly adult birds.  Five others are conspicuously washed with buff, especially on the chest and legs.  Two of them still showed traces of natal down, and all were taken under such circumstances as to indicate that they were just out of the nest, this being confirmed by the condition of the internal organs.</p>
				<p>Only one example (Niangara, June 8) is of intermediate tint, and while not plainly a juvenile bird, it was noted as non-breeding.  The evidence seems sufficient to show that the whiteness of the breast is not simply a matter of variation, but primarily a mark of the adult.</p>
				<p>In the Congo the barn-owl has never been found on high mountains, nor is it known from the grasslands near Lake Albert and Lake Edward. It seems to be wanting on the Kivu plateau, although in Abyssinia it nests at Addis Ababa, and in Kenya Colony is found to at least 5000 feet.</p>
				<p>North and south of the Congo forest, and in the Katanga, barn-owls are fairly common. In addition to published localities, there are specimens in the Congo Museum from Zambi, Leopoldville, Dilolo, Mukula Gombe, Lake Musolo, Kansenia, Kiambi, and the vicinity of Kasongo.</p>
				<p>In the northern savanna we found them not at all rare near the Uelle and Dungu rivers, spending the day in the densest foliage they could find, often well away from water.  One was seen to fly from a crevice in a rocky cliff near Aba.  At the post of Faradje there were signs of the nocturnal visits of one or more of thse owls to the verandah of a house, where they perched on some projecting beams beneath the rafters, but a careful search failed to show that they were entering any of the buildings. A neighboring rubber tree with stout horizontal boughs was frequently visited, and pellets of fur and bones dropped beneath it.  Here we heard the voice, a hoarse &quot;sh-sh-sh-sh-sh.&mdash;,&quot; and finally brought down a bird by moonlight.</p>
				<p>Occasionally attention is called to them in the daytime by mobbing of small birds, and at 9 A.M. one day in October a barn-owl flew from a tree along the bank of the river Dungu, bearing in its claws the headless body of an adult female weaver bird (<taxonName>Textor cucullatus femininus</taxonName>), from
<pb n="404" id="t000120-p00410c.tif"/> which it had pulled all the flight-feathers.  A colony of these weavers was established there, and the owl was later found to have eaten two adult birds, being still busy with one of its captures by daylight.</p>
				<p>In this latitude the eggs are laid and young reared between November and May, largely during the dry season, as by so many predatory birds.  This was indicated by the dissection of adults, also by two broods of young, the first of which had just left the nest on May 1, and comprised at least three birds, while the other, in March, consisted of two still sitting in the tree where they had been reared.  Its trunk and a main limb were hollow, with several openings, and inside lay a great number of pellets, as well as a piece of egg-shell.  In neither case could we find the parents.</p>
				<p>Another well-known nesting site of the African barn-owl is in nests of <taxonName>Scopus umbretta</taxonName>.<note n="1">See Paget-Wilkes and Sladen, 1930, Ibis, p. 450; Geyr v. Schweppenburg, 1932, O. Mb., p. 48; Cheesman, 1935, Ibis, p. 320.</note>  Sets of eggs vary from three to six, their color being white.  At Mohoro, eastern Tanganyika Territory, Schuster<note n="2">1926, J. f. O., p. 528.</note> found barn-owls nesting in a house.  Eggs were first laid at the end of May, but young were still being reared in early September.  He gave the dimensions of four eggs as 35.3&ndash;39.5 mm. &times; 29.4&ndash;31.75.  In the southern Congo breeding may be expected between June and October, during the dry months.</p>
				<p>Only four of the stomachs we examined contained food, this consisting of remains of three passerine birds, fur and bones of a mouse, and grasshoppers (in one adult&apos;s stomach).</p>

Transvaal Mus., XVIII, p. 268, because <taxon><taxonName>Strix capensis</taxonName> A.

				<p>In addition to the type of <taxonName idx_name="Tyto cabr&aelig;">cabr&aelig;</taxonName>, which Bannerman has compared with the type of <taxonName idx_name="Tyto capensis">capensis</taxonName>, the Congo Museum has four adults from Kunungu near Bolobo, two nestlings from Luluabourg in the Kasai, one immature specimen from Ibanda on the west side of Lake Kivu, and a sub-adult from Rutshuru.  The wings of the five adults from the Congo measure 310&ndash;320 mm., their tails 108&ndash;116 mm.  Their underparts vary from nearly pure white, always spotted, to light buff; but neither this color nor the size of white spots on the back seems indicative of sex.</p>
				<p>The nestlings from Luluabourg, with wings 205 and 242 mm., were taken in the latter part of July.  Their facial discs are rather rufous, underparts deep buff with blackish spots, and remiges very much darker than those of adults.  The natal down still adhering to their plumage is grayish cinnamon.</p>
				<p>Nothing has been recorded of the habits of the grass-owl in the Congo.  In South Africa it is most often flushed from the ground amid grass or reeds, sometimes about marshes, though it has also been met with in the &quot;bush&quot; as well.  A nest was found in a swamp in Cape Province by Atmore in May, and others by Millar in South Africa from April to August.  The eggs of the species are described as white, with granular surface, measuring 37.3&ndash;43.18 mm. &times; 30.5&ndash;35.5.</p>

<pb n="408" id="t000120-p00414c.tif"/> frequents rocky hills in savannas, is not found much above 6000 feet in the Congo, and has been taken just once in the Lower Guinea forest, on a great bare rock at Ebolowa, Cameroon.<note n="1">Bates, 1907, Ibis, p. 423; 1909," idem, p. 26.</note>
				</p>
				<p>Swainson&apos;s description of <taxonName idx_name="Caprimulgus trimaculatus">C. trimaculatus</taxonName> is indeterminable, so the species must be called <taxonName idx_name="Caprimulgus tristigma">tristigma</taxonName>.  <taxonName idx_name="Caprimulgus tristigma tristigma">C. t. tristigma</taxonName> ranges from Abyssinia and the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan to the Uelle district, the vicinity of Lake Edward, Uganda, and Nairobi in Kenya Colony.  Its wing measures 170&ndash;181 mm.  <taxonName idx_name="Caprimulgus tristigma lentiginosus">C. t. lentiginosus</taxonName> of southern Africa, north to Tanganyika Territory, the southeastern Congo, and central Angola, is not very different in color, but has the wing usually 183&ndash;195 mm. long.  <taxonName idx_name="Caprimulgus tristigma sharpei">C. t. sharpei</taxonName>, which ranges from the region of the Ubangi west to French Guinea and supposedly Senegal, is a smaller, darker race, with wing 164&ndash;176 mm.</p>
				<p>The typical race of the rock goatsucker is found only locally in the northeastern Congo, wherever there are hills with considerable expanses of bare rock.  We observed or secured specimens in the Upper Uelle near Garamba, Aba, Mt. Gaima, and northwest of Nzoro.  Elsewhere we did not even hear its voice.  Relatively low hills with naked rocks are likely to be inhabited, while much larger ones overgrown with grass and trees may not be.  If it is present it will make the fact known soon after dusk by a weird &quot;whow-whow!&quot; repeated again and again. Occasionally there are three syllables, rarely four, in quick succession. Calling begins again before dawn.  In the Uelle we heard it in April, July, and December.</p>
				<p>During my visit to the eastern Congo I saw <taxonName idx_name="Caprimulgus tristigma tristigma">tristigma</taxonName> on Mt. Avu, north of Nioka, and heard it call near the new post of Beni and at the new station of Kasindi.  A specimen was collected near Fort Portal. It does not ascend the forested slopes of the higher mountains.</p>
				<p>By day the rock goatsuckers rest in sheltered positions on the rocks, where their resemblance in color to the dark weathered granite is extraordinarily deceptive.</p>
				<p>In the Uelle eggs were laid in the early part of the rainy season, directly upon the bare rock or in a spot where some pebbles and earth had accumulated in a slight depression, and not far from a loose block of stone.  We found two sets, on April 13 and 19, near Gangura&apos;s village, northwest of Nzoro.  The females were incubating, they sat very close, and then played the usual game of hide-and-seek.</p>
				<p>While caprimulgine eggs are often as protectively colored as the birds that lay them, these on the contrary became very conspicuous
<pb n="409" id="t000120-p00415c.tif"/> when abandoned.  They were whitish, spotted irregularly with dull brown, many of the markings clouded by a thin layer of chalk.  One set measured 29.1 &times; 21.6 and 30.4 &times; 21.7.</p>
				<p>At Garamba Lang found two young with tails still very short on May 5.  In general coloration their plumage was like that of adults, only more spotted with buff above.  So their juvenal plumage was more like the adult than in species of <taxonName>Caprimulgus</taxonName> with a more complex color-pattern.  It may well be that <taxonName idx_name="Caprimulgus tristigma">C. tristigma</taxonName> lays its eggs during the early rains because of the great heat on open rocks during the dry season. But the one specimen whose stomach-contents I noted was an incubating female.  She had eaten many winged termites, and the abundance of such food during the breeding season may also have some importance.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;Namaqualand and Transvaal north to the vicinity of Songea and Njombe in Tanganyika Territory, the Upper Katanga, southern Lulua district, and Mombolo on the Benguella plateau.  Sir Harry Johnston was certainly mistaken in reporting <taxonName idx_name="Caprimulgus tristigma lentiginosus">lentiginosus</taxonName> from the Lower Congo, he probably saw <taxonName idx_name="Caprimulgus fossii">C. fossii</taxonName>.

				<p>ADULTS.&mdash;Iris very dark brown, rim of eyelids light brown; bill brown with black tip; feet brown, claws black.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;From Eritrea, southwestern Arabia, and Somaliland westward across the Sudan to Asben, the Gold Coast Colony, and the French Sudan.  The greater part of the range is occupied by <taxonName idx_name="Caprimulgus inornatus inornatus">C. i. inornatus</taxonName>, which breeds in the north and migrates afterward to East Africa, where it reaches Usambara, Usaramo, and Iranga, to Uganda, and to the savannas just north of the equatorial forest belt, from the Uelle west to the Gold Coast.  <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Caprimulgus inornatus vinacea-brunneus">C. i. vinacea-brunneus</taxonName> Bannerman</taxon>,<note n="2">1932, B. B. O. C., LII, p. 147 (Tawa, French Sudan).</note> of a distinctive vinaceous brown color, is known only from the French Niger Territory, where it appears to breed.  This race also may be expected to migrate southward.</p>
				<p><taxonName idx_name="Caprimulgus inornatus inornatus">C. i. inornatus</taxonName> shows great variation in color.  One of our males from the Uelle is a bright rufous bird, as is also one of the females.  The remaining specimens exhibit complete gradation in both sexes between the rufous and gray phases.  The darkest of the females is a brownish-gray bird, of a deeper shade than any of the males.  This diversity of coloration seems to have nothing to do with age.  The ruddiest male is a fully adult bird; the reddest of the females, on the other hand, is not quite adult, and another female of the same age is one of those in the gray phase.</p>
				<p>The plain nightjar certainly does not nest in Congo territory, nor even in adjacent regions of Uganda or the Sudan.  All our specimens
<pb n="411" id="t000120-p00417c.tif"/> were taken in the months from November to April.  Boyd Alexander secured three specimens on the right bank of the Ubangi near Luma Island in November, and another near Angu on the Uelle in early February. None has yet been found within the forest belt of the Congo, but in the Cameroon forest Bates collected two at Bitye in December and February.</p>
				<p>The nest of <taxonName idx_name="Caprimulgus inornatus">C. inornatus</taxonName> has not yet been discovered, but there can be no doubt that it breeds toward June along the southern edge of the Sahara<note n="1">See Lynes, 1925, Ibis, p. 369.</note> and near the Red Sea.  Dr. van Someren<note n="2">1930, Journ. E. Afr. Ug. N. H. Soc., No. 35, p. 45.</note> has reported specimens from Koroli and Marsabit, northern Kenya Colony, in July.  All the other East African specimens I have seen were taken between December and March.</p>
				<p>Near Niangara in the Uelle district this seemed to be the commonest nightjar in December.  It was fond of sitting on dry, dusty paths, and appeared there just before darkness fell.  Short sallies would be made into the air after passing insects, and by nightfall their stomachs were usually well filled.  On the ground they uttered only a low &quot;chuck,&quot; and they seemed to have no other call.</p>
				<p>During the day <taxonName>Caprimulgus inornatus</taxonName> would be found on the ground in the woods, but when flushed sometimes alighted on the branches of trees.  Near Gangura&apos;s village, northwest of Nzoro, it took refuge in the wooded swamps; and along the Dungu River I found it on a steep, wooded bank, as well as on a small island below Faradje.  Only once or twice I saw it at night on the open ground in the post of Faradje.</p>
				<p>The stomachs of eight individuals yielded a variety of insects, representing six different orders.  Seven of them had eaten beetles, including dung-beetles and an elater; 5 had eaten small numbers of hemiptera; 4 had swallowed moths; 4, large winged ants; 2 had disposed of 6 mantises; 2 more, of 3 grasshoppers; 1, a large leaf-hopper, and another a cricket.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;Abyssinia, south in the highlands of East Africa to Kilimanjaro, Usambara, and West Nyasa, also the higher mountains of the eastern Congo border, and probably the Benguella plateau.  <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Caprimulgus poliocephalus poliocephalus">C. p. poliocephalus</taxonName> R&uuml;ppell</taxon> of Abyssinia and East Africa has the outer tail-feathers in males white practically to the base, although there may be some blackish brown on the outer web, distally. In the female the inner web is white over the distal half or more. Wing (both sexes) 147&ndash;156 mm.</p>
				<p><taxonName idx_name="Caprimulgus poliocephalus ruwenzorii">C. p. ruwenzorii</taxonName> is often darker in general color, and males have well-marked blackish bases on outer tail-feathers, so that the white distal area is only 50&ndash;61 mm. long.  Females have white tips only 23&ndash;31 mm. in length.  Wing in males 150&ndash;162 mm., in females 154&ndash;161 mm.  This race is now known from Ruwenzori, the Kivu Volcanoes, the mountains west of Lake Edward, and those northwest of Lake Tanganyika.  It seems likely that <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Caprimulgus koesteri">C. koesteri</taxonName> Neumann</taxon><note n="1">1931, J. f. O., p. 550 (Chipepe, Bailundu).</note> of the Angolan highland and still more certain that <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Caprimulgus pectoralis guttifer">C. &quot;pectoralis&quot; guttifer</taxonName> Grote</taxon><note n="2">1921, J. f. O., p. 125 (Mlalo, near Wilhelmstal).</note> of Usambara, southwest Tanganyika Territory, and the Vipya plateau will prove to be races of this same species.</p>
				<p>The Ruwenzori nightjar is a mountain-dweller, living above 6000 feet, and especially about the borders of mountain-forests in areas cleared by natives, or on bracken-covered ridges.  It has not been found above 9000 feet.  The voice of the male is of two syllables, high-pitched whistles with a buzzing quality, or finely trilled, which we recalled by the words &quot;p&icirc;&icirc;&icirc;r, f&icirc;&icirc;&icirc;&icirc;r.&quot;  It is repeated at short intervals, especially if there be a bright moon.</p>
				<p>In Kenya Colony <taxonName idx_name="Caprimulgus poliocephalus poliocephalus">C. p. poliocephalus</taxonName> gives very similar notes, but usually from a perch in a tree, whereas ruwenzorii seemed invariably to call from the ground.  We collected specimens on the western slope of Ruwenzori near 7000 feet, and at Matembe in the mountains west of Lake Edward, 7500 feet.  The species was also heard calling near Burunga, at the base of Mt. Mikeno, 6500 feet; and in August, 1937, I saw several on the automobile road through the mountain forest north of Kibati.</p>
				<p>Our specimens from Ruwenzori in November and December were all in breeding condition, as was also a male at Matembe in March.  Dr. Schouteden&apos;s specimen from Burunga, December 13, is a young male still wholly clad in juvenal plumage, with white tail-patches well developed. His other young male from Nya-Muzinga, December 30, is in post-juvenal molt on crown, back, and breast.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;Natal and Zululand, Angola, Gaboon coast, savannas of southern and eastern Congo, Uganda, southern Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, and Uelle district; then westward north of the forest belt to Liberia.</p>
				<p><taxonName idx_name="Caprimulgus natalensis natalensis">C. n. natalensis</taxonName> Smith is known with certainty only from South Africa, and has wings 149&ndash;163 mm.  <taxonName idx_name="Caprimulgus natalensis fulviventris">C. n. fulviventris</taxonName> is supposed to differ by its more fulvous coloration and less barred underparts.  If valid it may extend from nothern Angola eastward to the southern Congo and the Ruzizi Valley.  <taxonName idx_name="Caprimulgus natalensis gabonensis">C. n. gabonensis</taxonName> of the Gaboon and Lower and Middle Congo is distinguished by its small size, wings usually 138&ndash;147 mm. <taxonName idx_name="Caprimulgus natalensis chadensis">C. n. chadensis</taxonName>, of the northeastern Congo, Uganda, and the southern Sudan west to Lake Chad, is rather like natalensis in color, but with slightly shorter wings, 147&ndash;159 mm. in adults.  <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Caprimulgus natalensis accr&aelig;">C. n. accr&aelig;</taxonName> Shelley</taxon>, ranging from the vicinity of Mt. Cameroon west to Liberia, is much darker and grayer than any of the other races, and has wings 146&ndash;154 mm.</p>
				<p>The type of <taxonName idx_name="Caprimulgus natalensis fulviventris">fulviventris</taxonName>, in the British Museum, is in adult male plumage, with wing 154 mm.  It is rather fulvous or tawny in general coloration, apparently with little dark barring on the underparts, though this may be due in part to the way the skin was made up.  A male from Atene, Kwango district, in the Congo Museum, with wing 151 mm. is not less barred on the underparts than <taxonName idx_name="Caprimulgus natalensis chadensis">chadensis</taxonName>, nor is it more fulvous above. At Nyanza on the northeast shore of Lake Tanganyika Raven collected an immature male, with wing 147 mm., which is more fulvous or sandy than any of our skins of <taxonName idx_name="Caprimulgus natalensis chadensis">chadensis</taxonName> save one from the Rutshuru Plain. In the Congo Museum there is an adult male from the Ruzizi Valley, wing 152 mm., which may perhaps be referable to <taxonName idx_name="Caprimulgus natalensis fulviventris">fulviventris</taxonName>.  On the other hand, Admiral Lynes collected specimens at Sandoa and Lake Mukamba which he regarded as typical <taxonName idx_name="Caprimulgus natalensis natalensis">natalensis</taxonName>.</p>
				<p>The species seems to be scarce in the southeastern Congo, and I did not hear it call along the Lualaba River in 1927.  Neither did Gaston de Witte collect it in the Katanga.</p>
				<pb n="414" id="t000120-p00420c.tif"/>

				<p>ADULTS.&mdash;Iris rather dark brown, rim of eyelids light brown; bill brown with blackish tip; feet buff.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;From the Rutshuru Plain, Uganda, Kakamega in Kenya Colony, and the Baro River westward across the southern Sudan and the Uelle to Lake Chad.  It may prove inseparable from <taxonName idx_name="Caprimulgus natalensis fulviventris">fulviventris</taxonName>.</p>
				<p>Though never entering the heavy forest, and not reported from the Kivu plateau, <taxonName idx_name="Caprimulgus natalensis chadensis">C. n. chadensis</taxonName> is common in the Rutshuru Plain, and at the new post of Beni and about Irumu it is the commonest member of the family.  We noted it at Kasenyi on the shore of Lake Albert, and it is common in the Upper Uelle savannas.  One was flushed from an open bog near Pawa in the northern Ituri.</p>
				<p>In the vicinity of Faradje it is non-migratory, and often seen at dusk flying low about termite hills where the winged brood is escaping, or about cow-sheds and pastures.  When resting on the ground it sometimes utters a low &quot;k&ibreve;k.&quot; The most characteristic call, probably given only by males, is a prolonged &quot;chop-chop-chop-chop&mdash;,&quot; not so rapid as the gurgling of <taxonName idx_name="Caprimulgus fossii">C. fossii</taxonName>, or the clicking of <taxonName>Scotornis</taxonName>.  It continues for indefinite periods, while the maker is usually hidden in high grass, but occasionally sitting on a termite hill or low bush.  In the eastern Congo its voice is heard through most of the year.  Still another note is a tremulous &quot;wha-hu-hu-hu&quot; emitted during flight.</p>
				<p>During the day they retire to open grassy meadows, often marshy during the rains, where they squat on some small open place, or a flat stone, amid the grass.  It is in these spots that they lay their eggs, toward the month of April in the Uelle district.</p>
				<p>Near Niangara, April 20, I found a set of two eggs on a small patch of
<pb n="415" id="t000120-p00421c.tif"/> bare earth completely enclosed and shaded by grass about knee-high, near the edge of a grassy marsh.  Their color is white, with many faint spots of brownish, so clouded over that the whole egg, at first glance, looks simply dirty white.  Dimensions: 26.4 &times; 21.4 mm. and 27.2 &times; 21.3.  The female was incubating, and flew up silently only when almost stepped on.  Two eggs were found in a similar situation near Faradje in April by Judge Smets; the one which he brought me being dull white, practically unspotted, 28.5 mm. &times; 21.5.  The young birds retain an immature plumage for many months, but the season of reproduction is short, and probably over by July, as shown by dissection of our adult specimens.  Near Beni a nest with two downy young was located on March 2, and in the lower Rutshuru Valley another with one egg on May 7.</p>
				<p>Of 16 stomachs examined, 14 contained remains of beetles, sometimes recognized as dung-beetles, 8 had winged termites, or were largely filled with them, while hemiptera were taken only twice, and a green leaf-hopper once.</p>

				<p>SPECIMEN.&mdash;Leopoldville, &male; im., Dec. 21.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;Savannas of the Gaboon to the Lower Congo, Leopoldville, and the Lake Leopold district.  Of this race I have examined Alexander&apos;s types in the British Museum and ten other specimens from Leopoldville, Kunungu near Bolobo, Lukolela, and Ngombe. Wings of six males measure 139&ndash;147 mm., of six females 138&ndash;152 mm. Immature examples of <taxonName idx_name="Caprimulgus natalensis chadensis">chadensis</taxonName> from the Uelle sometimes have wings only 143&ndash;147 mm. long.  At Boma I heard the calls of this species, and assume that the race there is <taxonName idx_name="Caprimulgus natalensis gabonensis">gabonensis</taxonName>.  But intergradation with <taxonName idx_name="Caprimulgus natalensis fulviventris">fulviventris</taxonName> must take place not far to the south of Boma.</p>
				<p>In habits and voice this subspecies is exactly like <taxonName idx_name="Caprimulgus natalensis chadensis">chadensis</taxonName>.  It is not at all rare in grassy situations along the middle Congo, but never enters the forest.  At Leopoldville I shot the above-mentioned specimen by day in a pasture.  At Kunungu Dr. Schouteden&apos;s collector Gw&eacute; obtained two males and a female.  The female has exceptionally long wings, 152 mm.  At Lukolela I heard one calling very frequently between February 28 and April 4, 1931.  Two examples were collected there after my departure.  During the evening of March 6, 1931, at
<pb n="416" id="t000120-p00422c.tif"/> Ngombe, I saw about eight examples near the government station, and by approaching them very cautiously with a focusing flashlight I was able to capture three in my hand.  A negro obtained a fourth by hitting it with a stick.  The two adult males taken that evening showed fair enlargement of the gonads, and the adult female had just laid one egg.  So they were breeding at a rather rainy time of year.</p>
				<p>Near the aviation field at Boma I heard two birds calling from high grass in a low marshy spot during the evening of April 23, but could not obtain a specimen.</p>

				<p><taxon><taxonName idx_name="Caprimulgus pectoralis pectoralis">C. p. pectoralis</taxonName> Cuvier</taxon>, of Cape Province, Natal, and Zululand, is dark in color, with a collar of large buffy spots around the hind-neck, and wings 155&ndash;170 mm.  <taxonName idx_name="Caprimulgus pectoralis fervidus">C. p. fervidus</taxonName> is lighter, less boldly barred on lower breast and flanks, markedly rufous from lores to ear-coverts, and with a conspicuous rufous collar; wing-length 150&ndash;171 mm.

				<p>The Congo Museum has skins of <taxonName idx_name="Caprimulgus pectoralis fervidus">fervidus</taxonName> from Kiambi on the Luvua
<pb n="417" id="t000120-p00423c.tif"/> River, Elisabethville, and Lake Musolo in the eastern Lulua district. Rockefeller and Murphy secured seven males at Kasoko, Kampia, and Lake Suse in southern Marungu, at altitudes between 3800 and 4500 feet. The Museum of Comparative Zo&ouml;logy has a female collected by Pierrepont 20 miles south of Pania Mutombo, and <taxonName idx_name="Caprimulgus pectoralis fervidus">fervidus</taxonName> may also be expected in the southern Kwango district.</p>
				<p>Notes are lacking in the habits of this nightjar in the Congo, but in Gazaland Swynnerton<note n="1">1908, Ibis, p. 393.</note> found it frequenting the outskirts of forests and forest-remnants consisting of a few trees on grassy slopes.  They frequently sat lengthwise on the larger branches of trees with reddish bark. The voice of <taxonName idx_name="Caprimulgus pectoralis fervidus">fervidus</taxonName> appears to be similar to that of <taxonName idx_name="Caprimulgus pectoralis nigriscapularis">nigriscapularis</taxonName>, for Belcher<note n="2">1930, `Birds of Nyasaland,' p. 147.

In Nyasaland it is heard from February to October.  The breeding season in Southern Rhodesia is October and November, possibly January as well.  At Mt.

				<p>SPECIMENS.&mdash;Nzoro, &male;, Aug. 1.  Matadi, &female;, &female; juv., Dec. 26.</p>
				<p>ADULTS.&mdash;Iris dark brown, rim of eyelids light brown; bill brown, shading to black at tip; feet dark brown.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;From Baraka on Lake Tanganyika north to Uganda<note n="5">van Someren, 1922, Nov. Zool., XXIX, p. 84, reported one example from Nairobi in Kenya Colony.</note> and the eastern edge of the Congo, then westward through the northern Congo and the southern Bahr-el-Ghazal to French Equatorial
<pb n="418" id="t000120-p00424c.tif"/> Africa, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, and Portuguese Guinea.  Also occurs in the Lower Congo, and perhaps up the Congo River to the vicinity of Kunzulu.  While found up to 4500 feet, it does not ascend the slopes of the higher mountains.</p>
				<p>The female example obtained at Baraka by Pauwels shows no approach in color to <taxonName idx_name="Caprimulgus pectoralis fervidus">fervidus</taxonName>, though its wing is rather long, 165 mm.  The wing of my female from Matadi measures only 148 mm.  Seven males of <taxonName idx_name="Caprimulgus pectoralis nigriscapularis">nigriscapularis</taxonName> from Uganda and the northeastern Congo have wings 150&ndash;158 mm.</p>
				<p>Reichenow&apos;s type of <taxonName idx_name="Caprimulgus pectoralis nigriscapularis">nigriscapularis</taxonName>, though labeled as a female, is undoubtedly a male.  It has the white patch on outermost rectrix a little larger than in our male from Nzoro, where it is 41 mm. long.  The white spots on outermost tail-feathers of females are only 20&ndash;27 mm. long.</p>
				<p>The rather peculiar distribution of this race is readily explained by its preference for the borderland of the lowland forest.  It is not often collected because it seeks thick cover during the daytime, and only its sweet voice is apt to betray its presence.  Its occurrence in Sierra Leone has recently been announced by Bannerman,<note n="1">1936, B. B. O. C., LVI, p. 62.</note> and Rudyerd Boulton has shown me a specimen he collected in the Benin Province of Nigeria.</p>
				<p>From the gallery forests of the Uelle, at dusk or during the night, one hears a quavering &quot;t-w&ibreve;p, t&ubreve;rr-r-r-r-r-r,&quot; often repeated, which is clearly the note of a nightjar.  We noticed it especially in the district just south of Niangara, in December, at Madrapili&apos;s between Faradje and Aba, in December, at Nzoro in August, and even at Ibambi in the northern Ituri in July.  By elimination I decided that it must be the call of <taxonName idx_name="Caprimulgus pectoralis nigriscapularis">nigriscapularis</taxonName>, of which I obtained only a single individual near Nzoro.  This bird was flushed from the ground in woods fringing the Kibali River, and alighted on a low branch.</p>
				<p>Near Matadi I found a female on the slope of a stony hill during the afternoon.  She flew a little way, alighted on a rock, and then began to flutter about as though wounded.  At the spot she had left there crouched a single chick in natal down, pale grayish buff, varied with dusky on the lores, a post-ocular line, and on wings and back.  Four other nightjars observed on Loadi hill, south of Matadi, may also have been <taxonName idx_name="Caprimulgus pectoralis nigriscapularis">nigriscapularis</taxonName>.</p>
				<p>In August, 1926, at Bogoro on the escarpment west of Lake Albert, I finally proved the authorship of the tremulous calls with the aid of an electric flashlight, by collecting a male <taxonName idx_name="Caprimulgus pectoralis nigriscapularis">nigriscapularis</taxonName>.  Others were heard at Bambu near Kilo, Beni, Nganzi&apos;s village at the west base of
<pb n="419" id="t000120-p00425c.tif"/> Ruwenzori, Mai-na-Ivi in the Rutshuru Plain, and Lueba on the northwest shore of Lake Tanganyika.  In July, 1930, at Mambutu, a wood post on the middle Congo River below Kunzulu, I again heard a goat-sucker calling in very similar tones, which I believe to have been of this race.</p>
				<p>The sweet, if melancholy, &quot;tw&ibreve;p, t&ubreve;rr-r-r-r-r-r&quot; is repeated as its maker perches on a low branch or leaning stalk of elephant grass.  The birds begin to call at dusk and continue, if there is bright moonlight, well into the night.  Just before daybreak it is taken up again.  In the Semliki Valley <taxonName idx_name="Caprimulgus pectoralis nigriscapularis">C. p. nigriscapularis</taxonName> was in condition to breed at the end of January, and besides the call described above it occasionally repeated a monotonous &quot;what-what-what&mdash;&quot; or &quot;kwa-kwa-kwa&mdash;&quot; without pause as many as twenty or thirty times.  This sound is audible only for a short distance.  The call-note is of two or three husky &quot;chucks&quot; in rapid succession.</p>
				<p>In the Uelle district nesting may be expected to begin toward April or May, in the Lower Congo toward November.  The eggs are still unknown.</p>

				<p>ADULTS.&mdash;Iris very dark brown, rim of eyelids grayish brown; bill black at tip, brown at base; scales of feet grayish brown, but softer skin whitish, soles yellowish.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;Rain forest of Lower Guinea, from Bitye in southern Cameroon south to the middle Congo River, east to the southern Uelle district, the Semliki Valley, and probably the Manyema forest.</p>
				<p>This is the largest nightjar of the Congo, save <taxonName>Cosmetornis vexillarius</taxonName>. Five adult males from the Congo have wings 185&ndash;199 mm., tails 142&ndash;157. Six Congo females: wings 183&ndash;191 mm., tails 139&ndash;150.  The white patches on outer tail-feathers of males measure 21&ndash;27 mm. in length. Females have not even a light patch to correspond.</p>
				<p><taxonName>Veles binotatus</taxonName> and <taxonName>Caprimulgus batesi</taxonName> are the only nightjars truly at home in the West African forests.  <taxonName>Caprimulgus europ&aelig;us</taxonName>, <taxonName idx_name="Caprimulgus inornatus">inornatus</taxonName>,
<pb n="420" id="t000120-p00426c.tif"/> <taxonName idx_name="Caprimulgus rufigena">rufigena</taxonName>, and <taxonName idx_name="Caprimulgus fossii">fossii</taxonName>, as well as <taxonName>Scotornis climacurus</taxonName> and <taxonName>Cosmetornis vexillarius</taxonName>, all invade the forest belt occasionally, but then are restricted to the most open clearings they can find.  Bates&apos;s nightjar, on the contrary, is a bird which I never met save in the forest itself.  The first individual seen flew up from a game-trail in an unfrequented part of the forest and perched on a low bough.  Another was said to have taken wing at my shot, and disappeared in the undergrowth.  Relatively few of them are seen, and they usually behave in the same way, alighting sometimes on the ground, but often perching, and always showing an unexpected shyness, so that the majority make off successfully into the forest.</p>
				<p>On two occasions, along the forested bank of the Ituri, in April and July, 1914, I heard notes which I was inclined to credit to <taxonName>Caprimulgus batesi</taxonName>.  They might be written &quot;whow-whow-whow&mdash;,&quot; the same syllable being repeated from two to twelve times.  As good reasons for assigning them to the nightjar, I may explain that they were heard at night from places I knew the bird to live, that they recalled strongly the voice of another member of the genus (<taxonName idx_name="Caprimulgus tristigma">C. tristigma</taxonName>) in the Uelle, and finally that no other nightjar is known to inhabit these places.</p>
				<p>Nearly thirteen years passed before I was able to verify this assumption. On February 9, 1927, I arrived at a rest-house called Masimango&apos;s in the Semliki forest about 10 miles west of the base of Ruwenzori.  As night fell, three or four birds were heard in different directions from the forest, repeating the same &quot;whow-whow-whow&mdash;&quot; that I had heard near Avakubi.  It would be given more rapidly than the call of <taxonName idx_name="Caprimulgus tristigma">tristigma</taxonName> and was not so loud.  Moreover, it continued for ten to a dozen times in one spell.</p>
				<p>So a search was started with the flashlight, and finally one yellow eye showed forth in the forest undergrowth at a spot whence the noise had come.  After my shot, silence; and the bird could not be found until the following morning.  It was an adult male of <taxonName idx_name="Caprimulgus batesi">C. batesi</taxonName>, and seemed to have been sitting on a branch 8 or 10 feet from the ground.  The next evening another was heard calling at the village of Mutshunga Mabese, but far off in the woods.  This was the first time the species had been taken in the Semliki Valley, and it is scarcely to be expected farther east. However, it might find a suitable environment in some of the larger forests of Uganda.</p>
				<p>At Lukolela in 1930, a native hunter secured a male and a female for me.  The latter, on October 6, had laid a single egg right in a footpath through the forest.</p>
				<pb n="421" id="t000120-p00427c.tif"/>
				<p>Bates<note n="1">1909, Ibis, p. 25.</note> has found that this nightjar often sits on its egg&mdash;for it lays but one&mdash;at the edge of a garden or plantation.  Eggs taken at Bitye measured 31.5&ndash;34.5 mm. &times; 24&ndash;25 and were of oval form, somewhat glossy.  The ground-color is white, with blotches of brown and pale lavender-gray often distributed over the entire shell.</p>
				<p>In the Ituri, too, but a single young nightjar is reared at a time, for at Medje the natives found them for us on April 2, September 22, and October 6.  The natal down is yellowish buff, with no dark markings whatever; and the juvenal plumage (in specimens with tails 36 and 42 mm.) is similar to that of adults of corresponding sex, but distinctly paler, both above and below.  The white tail-spots of the male make their appearance in this first plumage.</p>
				<p>According to Bates<note n="2">1908, Ibis, p. 564.</note> the goatsuckers of the Cameroon forest breed at all seasons except during the greater rains (August to October), and it is probable that in the Ituri the breeding season of <taxonName idx_name="Caprimulgus batesi">C. batesi</taxonName> extends practically throughout the year.  Our four adults were all noted as having the gonads slightly enlarged, and the dates of the young birds offer similar evidence.  In the Congo Museum there is a half-grown nestling from Barumbu in July.</p>
				<p>In the stomach of each of four adults, beetles were found, the other insects eaten consisting of moths (once), 3 mantises, a cricket, 2 grasshoppers, and a large ant.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;Europe, Northwest Africa and temperate
<pb n="423" id="t000120-p00429c.tif"/> Asia east to the Gobi Desert.  Divisible into five subspecies, some of which migrate southward into Africa and India.  According to Colonel Meinertzhagen<note n="1">1922, Ibis, p. 43.  See also Bannerman, 1933, `Birds Trop. W. Afr.,' III, pp. 149&ndash;152.</note> the typical race is best distinguished from <taxonName idx_name="Caprimulgus europ&aelig;us meridionalis">C. e. meridionalis</taxonName> by its longer wing, 189&ndash;204 mm. in males, whereas males of <taxonName idx_name="Caprimulgus europ&aelig;us meridionalis">meridionalis</taxonName> have wings 174&ndash;189 mm.  <taxonName idx_name="Caprimulgus europ&aelig;us unwini">C. e. unwini</taxonName> is paler in color than either of the foregoing, with wings of males 178&ndash;195 mm.  Females are very like males in size.</p>
				<p><taxonName idx_name="Caprimulgus europ&aelig;us europ&aelig;us">C. e. europ&aelig;us</taxonName> breeds in Europe, as far north as Archangel, and east to the Urals, migrating in autumn south to Africa, where it has been found in Sierra Leone, the Congo, and even Cape Town.  <taxonName idx_name="Caprimulgus europ&aelig;us meridionalis">C. e. meridionalis</taxonName> migrates from the Mediterranean countries of Europe and Northwest Africa to the southwestern Congo and Natal.  <taxonName idx_name="Caprimulgus europ&aelig;us unwini">C. e. unwini</taxonName> comes from Persia and Turkestan to northeastern Africa, reaching the north-eastern Congo and possibly even Natal.</p>
				<p>My specimen from Avakubi is a perfectly typical female of <taxonName idx_name="Caprimulgus europ&aelig;us europ&aelig;us">C. e. europ&aelig;us</taxonName>, with wing 199 mm. long.  It was secured as it flew by at dusk, and had eaten beetles, a moth, and a small mantis.  Another female of this race, with wing 203 mm., I shot in the same manner at the new post of Beni on February 21, 1927.  At Tembwe on Lake Tanganyika, Dr. Schouteden collected a female with wing 200 mm., in February, 1926.</p>
				<p>It seems certain that few if any migrants of this species remain in the Uelle district during the northern winter, and the majority of the typical race may pass through the eastern half of Africa.  South African records of <taxonName idx_name="Caprimulgus europ&aelig;us europ&aelig;us">C. e. europ&aelig;us</taxonName> between November and March are numerous, and it must be a regular migrant to the eastern and southeastern Congo.</p>

				<p>SPECIMEN.&mdash;Avukubi, &female; im., January 12.</p>
				<p>Iris dark brown; bill brown at base, black at tip; feet brown.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;Breeds from Persia and Baluchistan to Kashmir and Turkestan, migrates southward to India and also to the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, eastern Africa, and as far as Natal.  In the Congo it may occur only in the eastern regions.</p>
				<p>Our single example from Avakubi was flying about at dusk near a house, alighting on the roof.  It is referred to <taxonName idx_name="Caprimulgus europ&aelig;us unwini">unwini</taxonName> because it is far grayer than the young of <taxonName idx_name="Caprimulgus europ&aelig;us europ&aelig;us">C. e. europ&aelig;us</taxonName> and extremely small, wing 165 mm., tail 107.  I have compared it with specimens of <taxonName idx_name="Caprimulgus europ&aelig;us unwini">unwini</taxonName> in the British Museum from Khartoum and Beira.  In the Congo Museum there is also a very pale female of <taxonName idx_name="Caprimulgus europ&aelig;us unwini">unwini</taxonName> from Beni, February 5, with wing 188 mm., tail 123.</p>
				<p>The bird from Avakubi fed on small beetles and hemiptera, three moths, two roaches, and one green grasshopper.</p>

				<p>SPECIMENS.&mdash;Boma, &male;, &female;, Jan. 8; &female; im., Jan. 12.  Matadi, &female; im., Dec. 26. Stanleyville, 1 ad. in &female; plumage.</p>
				<p>ADULTS.&mdash;Iris dark brown, rim of eyelids lighter brown; bill brown with black tip; feet brown.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;Zululand and Orange Free State north to the Danakil Coast, southern Abyssinia, Uganda, Semliki Valley, central Congo, and Gaboon Coast.</p>
				<p><taxon><taxonName idx_name="Caprimulgus fossii fossii">C. f. fossii</taxonName> Hartlaub</taxon> was described from the Gaboon and for many years was supposed to range far into central and southern Africa.  Finally W.W. Bowen<note n="1">1931, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., LXXXIII, pp. 40&ndash;43.</note> examined the series of nine specimens collected by Aschemeier for the U.S. National Museum in the Fernand Vaz district, and found that the typical race does not even reach the Congo.  These Gaboon specimens average smaller, with wings 141&ndash;150.5 mm., tails 96&ndash; 113, and they are dark in color, finely speckled above with whitish gray, in a way that is never quite matched by birds even from the Lower Congo. Specimens from the Congo almost always have a slight tawny wash over much of the upper surface, and especially the median rectrices.</p>
				<p>Bowen called the Congo birds <taxonName idx_name="Caprimulgus fossii clarus">clarus</taxonName>, but this is certainly erroneous. A much older name is <taxonName idx_name="Caprimulgus fossii welwitschii">welwitschii</taxonName>, the type of which was said to have the wing 160 mm. long.  This is a wide-ranging and variable race, examples of rather different coloration occurring in the same localities.  Wings of adults vary from 144 to 167 mm., tails from 100 to 132 mm., the longest rectrices exceeding the outermost by 1 to 14 mm.  The average length of wing and tail is only slightly greater in the eastern Congo than along the middle and lower Congo River.  <taxonName idx_name="Caprimulgus fossii welwitschii">C. f. welwitschii</taxonName> extends from the Congo mouth and the southern edge of the Congo forest through Angola, the Katanga, and Rhodesia perhaps to the Orange Free State.  It also occupies Uganda and the eastern savannas of the Congo north to the upper Semliki Valley.</p>
				<p><taxon><taxonName idx_name="Caprimulgus fossii mossambicus">C. f. mossambicus</taxonName> Peters</taxon> is a rather doubtful race inhabiting the East African coastlands from Mozambique north at least to Mombasa.  Many specimens are dark in color, and the median rectrices are not lengthened. Birds from the northern part of the range have usually short wings, 146&ndash; 154 mm., but near the lower Zambesi they measure 145&ndash;158 mm.<note n="2">Vincent, 1934, Ibis, p. 793.</note>  A skin from the Luombwa River, southeast Katanga, is so exceptionally dark that it may represent this form.</p>
				<pb n="426" id="t000120-p00432c.tif"/>
				<p>A single specimen from North Nyasaland was separated by Austin Roberts<note n="1">1932, Ann. Transvaal Mus., XV, p. 26 (Livingstonia).</note> as a new race, <taxonName idx_name="Caprimulgus fossii youngi">youngi</taxonName>, because its tail measured 140 mm.  The Congo Museum has a remarkable male example from Kiambi on the Luvua River, with wing 162 and tail 141 mm.  A female from the same locality has wing 162, tail 124.  The status of <taxonName idx_name="Caprimulgus fossii youngi">youngi</taxonName> is very doubtful, and other specimens from Kiambi, Moba on Lake Tanganyika, and the Upper Katanga show no special lengthening of the tail.</p>
				<p><taxon><taxonName idx_name="Caprimulgus fossii clarus">C. f. clarus</taxonName> Reichenow</taxon><note n="2">1892, J. f. O., pp. 29, 215 (Bukoba on L. Victoria).</note> is apparently a valid subspecies inhabiting the interior of Kenya Colony and Tanganyika Territory, usually below 5000 feet.  It is usually of light brown-and-gray coloration, with median rectrices often slightly longer than the next pair, and 5&ndash;19 mm. longer than the outermost.  Wing length 140&ndash;159 mm.  So far there is no proof that <taxonName idx_name="Caprimulgus fossii clarus">clarus</taxonName> ever reaches the eastern Congo.  A female from Gabiro, Ruanda, is probably <taxonName idx_name="Caprimulgus fossii welwitschii">welwitschii</taxonName>, and I have seen two specimens even from Bukoba which I would refer to that race.  <taxonName idx_name="Caprimulgus fossii clarus">C. f. clarus</taxonName> may be a migrant during its off-season to the western shore of Lake Victoria.</p>
				<p><taxon><taxonName idx_name="Caprimulgus fossii apatelius">C. f. apatelius</taxonName> Neumann</taxon><note n="3">1904, O. Mb., p. 143 (L. Abaya, Abyssinia).</note> of the Danakil Coast, southern Abyssinia, Jubaland, and northern Kenya Colony has the median rectrices noticeably lengthened, and wings measuring 147&ndash;162 mm.  The white bar on the outer primaries is more extensive than in the other races, and some specimens have white spots on greater and middle wing-coverts. There are two males of this race in the Congo Museum labeled as collected in the Uelle by Dr. Polidori.  I feel certain they did not come from Congo territory, but possibly from the Bahr-el-Jebel.</p>
				<p>In various ways <taxonName idx_name="Caprimulgus fossii apatelius">apatelius</taxonName> is intermediate between <taxonName>Caprimulgus fossii clarus</taxonName> and <taxonName>Scotornis climacurus</taxonName>.  But in view of the fact that <taxonName idx_name="Scotornis climacurus sclateri">Scotornis c. sclateri</taxonName> and <taxonName>Caprimulgus fossii welwitschii</taxonName> live side by side along the middle Congo River, it does not seem possible to unite the two species.  Grant and Mackworth-Praed<note n="4">1937, B.B.O.C., LVIII, pp. 18&ndash;20.</note> regard <taxonName idx_name="Caprimulgus fossii clarus">clarus</taxonName> as a race of <taxonName>Scotornis climacurus</taxonName>, with <taxonName idx_name="Caprimulgus fossii apatelius">apatelius</taxonName> a synonym of <taxonName idx_name="Caprimulgus fossii clarus">clarus</taxonName>.</p>
				<p>In the Congo, therefore, we can be sure of the occurrence of only one race, <taxonName idx_name="Caprimulgus fossii welwitschii">welwitschii</taxonName>, which occupies all the savannas of the south and southeast, as well as the east, north to Beni.  Specimens from Banana and Moanda are not <taxonName idx_name="Caprimulgus fossii fossii">C. f. fossii</taxonName>, as might have been expected.  This goat-sucker has also been found here and there in clearings of the Congo forest. I have taken it at Ganda Sundi in the Mayombe; Whiteside has
<pb n="427" id="t000120-p00433c.tif"/> collected it at Ikau on the upper Lulonga River, 1&Degree; 15&prime; N. lat., in July; and a specimen from Stanleyville was given me by Dr. Grossule.</p>
				<p>From Boma up to Kwamouth it is very common, specimens from the Kasai and Upper Katanga are not numerous, but about Kabalo and in the Ruzizi and Rutshuru Plains it is one of the commonest nightjars. While frequent around the shores of Lake Kivu, it does not ascend far above 5000 feet.</p>
				<p>During the day these birds hide in the grass or among bushes, then toward dusk they come out on the roads, flying low and alighting like <taxonName>Scotornis climacurus</taxonName>.  The voice is a prolonged gurgling or churring, given by the male as it squats on the ground.  It recalls that of the goat-sucker in Europe, and has something frog-like or toad-like about it. But in the case of <taxonName idx_name="Caprimulgus fossii">C. fossii</taxonName>, while it may continue for several minutes, one soon notices that it is divided into louder and weaker spells, which alternate.  The louder periods may last about five seconds, then the tone is abruptly lowered or weakened for perhaps two and a half seconds, and again the volume increases for another five seconds.  So it continues, and one almost wonders if there are not two birds calling, one of them intermittently.</p>
				<p>There is also another short note, a low, hollow &quot;chow&quot; or &quot;whiow,&quot; given by the bird in flight, and sometimes repeated at intervals.  Thus <taxonName idx_name="Caprimulgus fossii">C. fossii</taxonName> has two kinds of calls which parallel those of <taxonName>Scotornis climacurus</taxonName>.</p>
				<p>In the Rutshuru Plain, I collected one male in breeding condition on May 13, in the Ruzizi Valley a breeding female on July 13, and at Kabalongwe near Bukama a breeding male on August 10.  Other specimens taken at the same time were not ready for reproduction, so I believe these dates mark the beginning of the breeding season at each place.  At Sandoa, Lynes found a chick on a granite hill on September 8.  On the middle and lower Congo River it seems that the breeding season is from September to November.</p>
				<p>No nest of <taxonName idx_name="Caprimulgus fossii">C. fossii</taxonName> ever came to my notice, but the eggs of the species in southern Nyasaland are said to be laid in twos, especially amid grass near streams and pools.  They are light pinkish buff, spotted with faint purple and red-brown, one set measuring 26.6 &times; 20.3 and 27.4 &times; 20.5 mm.<note n="1">Paget-Wilkes and Sladen, 1930, Ibis, p. 452.</note>
				</p>
				<p>Of six examples of <taxonName idx_name="Caprimulgus fossii welwitschii">welwitschii</taxonName> collected at Boma in April, 1931, every one had its stomach filled with insects, mainly large winged termites. In most cases there were also a few small beetles, and in a few one or two hemiptera.</p>

				<p>SPECIMENS.&mdash;Faradje, 2 &female;, Feb. 7, Nov. 24.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;Senegal to the Blue Nile, south to the northern edge of the equatorial forest and to Uganda where specimens have been taken at Masindi, Entebbe, Kangao&apos;s, and Katwe. Occurring occasionally in the clearings of the Congo and Cameroon forests, it is also established in the grasslands of the middle Congo and northern Kasai.</p>
				<p>As for the generic characters of <taxonName>Scotornis</taxonName>, I agree with Dr. van Someren<note n="1">1922, Nov. Zool., XXIX, p. 86.</note> that they consist merely of a difference in the graduation of the tail-feathers.  The gap is more or less bridged by <taxonName>Caprimulgus fossii apatelius</taxonName>, so that the genus <taxonName>Scotornis</taxonName> should really be retained only if <taxonName idx_name="Caprimulgus fossii">fossii</taxonName> can be removed from <taxonName>Caprimulgus</taxonName> and included in <taxonName>Scotornis</taxonName>.</p>
				<p>The color variation in <taxonName idx_name="Scotornis climacurus">S. climacurus</taxonName> is considerable, the more arid districts bordering the Sahara, as pointed out by Sclater and Praed,<note n="2">1919, Ibis, pp. 657, 658.</note> usually having the palest birds, whereas the darkest forms are found in Sierra Leone and about Lake No.  <taxonName idx_name="Scotornis climacurus climacurus">S. c. climacurus</taxonName> is a pale brown race extending from Senegal and the Gambia east to Lake Chad and the region about Khartoum.  <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Scotornis climacurus leoninus">S. c. leoninus</taxonName> Bannerman</taxon>,<note n="3">1932, B.B.O.C., LIII, p. 148 (Bo, Sierra Leone).</note> with plumage very dark blackish brown, is known so far only from Sierra Leone.  <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Scotornis climacurus nigricans">S. c. nigricans</taxonName> Salvadori</taxon><note n="4">1868, Atti. Soc. Ital. Milano, p. 449 (White Nile).</note> is strikingly dark gray heavily vermiculated with black, and breeds near the Bahr-el-Ghazal and Sobat River.  <taxonName idx_name="Scotornis climacurus sclateri">S. c. sclateri</taxonName> is of dark coloration, usually strongly tinged with rufous or chestnut, and only very finely vermiculated.  It inhabits grasslands near the equatorial forest, on the northern side from Nigeria to the Lado Enclave, and on the south from the middle Congo River to the Kasai.  The most rufous specimens I have seen came from the Nyong River in Cameroon, January 15, and Buta in the Lower Uelle, January 16.  These may not be breeding birds of those places, but migrants from the north.</p>
				<p>In any case it seems certain that <taxonName idx_name="Scotornis climacurus climacurus">S. c. climacurus</taxonName>, which is said to breed near the Niger, Lake Chad, and Kordofan toward June and July, migrates southward after its nesting is over.  In the off-season it has been found at Freetown, Accra, Sakbayeme, and Bitye in southern Cameroon, and in the Upper Uelle.</p>
				<p>Of our two females of <taxonName idx_name="Scotornis climacurus climacurus">climacurus</taxonName> from Faradje, the one taken on
<pb n="429" id="t000120-p00435c.tif"/> November 24 has an exceedingly long tail, 196 mm., and very pale underparts. The other has the tail only 132 mm. and is more heavily barred on the breast.</p>

				<p>ADULTS.&mdash;Iris dark brown, rim of eyelids light brown, bill dusky brown or blackish at tip, brown at base; feet pinkish gray to brown.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;Savannas just north of the equatorial forest from the Lado district west to the lower Benue River, and perhaps to the Gold Coast Colony.  It ventures into clearings of the forest belt, especially in its northern half, and has crossed the forest and established itself in savannas from the middle Congo River to the Kasai district.</p>
				<p>Besides the localities mentioned in the synonymy, it has been collected at Mambutu, Langa-Langa, and Fumu Djale, villages on the &quot;channel&quot; between Maluku and Kwamouth, and at Luluabourg in the Kasai.  On the middle Congo I have found <taxonName>Scotornis climacurus</taxonName> and <taxonName>Caprimulgus fossii</taxonName> together in the same field, and neither species seemed migratory.  Specimens of <taxonName>Scotornis</taxonName> from south of the forest cannot be separated from those of the Uelle.</p>
				<p>One exceptionally rufous male from Buta has already been mentioned. The variation in color among our males from the Uelle is not very great, less indeed than among the females.  The latter average a little lighter than males, and one or two are decidedly washed with rufous.
<pb n="430" id="t000120-p00436c.tif"/> The tails of fourteen adult males from the Upper Uelle measure 177&ndash;260 mm., median rectrices exceeding outermost by 88&ndash;157 mm. Five males from Kwamouth and Kunungu have tails 189&ndash;218 mm., with longest feathers exceeding outermost by 90&ndash;113.  The average tail-length in the Uelle is 210.6 mm. on the middle Congo River 199.6.</p>
				<p>Six females of <taxonName idx_name="Scotornis climacurus sclateri">sclateri</taxonName> from the Upper Uelle have tails 143&ndash;169 mm., with graduation of feathers 57&ndash;74 mm.  Seven females from the middle Congo, tails 141&ndash;163, graduation 54&ndash;69 mm.</p>
				<p>Whether the examples reported from Toro are <taxonName idx_name="Scotornis climacurus sclateri">sclateri</taxonName> or migrants from farther north I cannot say, but <taxonName>Scotornis</taxonName> seems to be wanting in the savannas just west and south of Lake Albert.  Neither could I find <taxonName idx_name="Caprimulgus fossii">C. fossii</taxonName> there, and <taxonName idx_name="Caprimulgus natalensis">C. natalensis</taxonName> is the common goatsucker.</p>
				<p>Throughout the savannas of the Uelle <taxonName>Scotornis</taxonName> is the most abundant bird of the family, present all year round, though far more likely to be observed during the dry season.  At that period it calls loudly after sunset, and indeed sometimes in the middle of a cloudy day.  From the ground a loud, energetic, and protracted &quot;clicking&quot; noise is delivered, sounding like a rapid succession of electric sparks, a long &quot;k-k-k-k-k-k-k-k-k&mdash;.&quot;  I have known one bird to continue this for five minutes without interruption.  The toad-like voice of <taxonName>Caprimulgus europ&aelig;us</taxonName> is only faintly reminiscent of the noisy <taxonName>Scotornis</taxonName>.  It leaves the ground with an audible whirring of wings, and in flight <taxonName>Scotornis</taxonName> often gives a single short &quot;ch&ubreve;ng.&quot;  Not only are these goatsuckers silent during the greater part of the rainy season, but they are seldom seen then alighting on paths at nightfall.  Lest they be suspected of migrating northward, I must add that I have flushed them many times during the rains, and even as far south as Pawa, northern Ituri, in July.</p>
				<p>At Faradje it is toward the end of September that their behavior begins to change, they come to the roads at dusk; and in 1912 I noted that the clicking note was heard again on the evening of October 3, for the first time since it stopped in late May.  By December the birds' reproductive organs have begun to develop, but we found no sign of eggs before February.</p>
				<p>By day one flushes this nightjar from bare patches of earth or flat stones surrounded by grass, less often they sit in papyrus swamps; but their eggs are laid on high ground.  At Faradje, March 22, we were shown a set of two eggs, on bare earth slightly shaded by a bush, in a field where manioc had recently been grown.  Another similar set was found on April 23, in a field freshly cleaned for planting, where a few shoots of grass were the only vegetation.  The incubating females are
<pb n="431" id="t000120-p00437c.tif"/> readily snared.  As late as June 2, near Dungu, we found a bird which had deposited her two eggs on the bare ground in an important road.  It was on the side opposite the winding footpath the natives always followed; and thus it was that 40 porters had passed before us, and only the arrival of a man on a donkey frightened the nightjar from her eggs.  The ground was covered with small limonite pebbles, but a space of 1 1/2 to 2 inches all about the eggs had been swept clear.  Even though the eggs were much larger than the pebbles, they were practically invisible, being as usual of a brownish-white ground color, heavily spotted and blotched with brown.  The female bird took refuge in a bush, sitting crosswise on a sloping branch.  The dimensions of three sets of eggs are 23.5&ndash;25 mm. &times; 17.6&ndash;19.4.  The female we collected at Avakubi in December had only a very small ovary, and while several had been seen about the post, the clicking call was not heard.  During the remainder of the year none was ever found there.</p>
				<p>The breeding season south of the forest appears to begin toward August, and the male shot at Yumbi already had enlarged gonads.  At Lukolela I first heard the clicking call of <taxonName>Scotornis</taxonName> on March 3.</p>
				<p>Eleven out of fourteen stomachs contained beetle remains, including an elater and small dung-beetles, of which one bird had eaten 13.  Four birds had eaten moths, totaling only 7 individuals; four had eaten hemiptera; three, small grasshoppers (5 in all); two had taken mantises (4); two some winged driver-ants; and finally one had its stomach crammed with winged termites.</p>

				<p>ADULTS.&mdash;Iris brownish black, rim of eyelids light brown; bill brown with black tip; feet brown.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;Senegal to Asben, Sennar, Eritrea, and Abyssinia, limited on the south by the northern edge of the equatorial forests, but occurring occasionally along the western side of Lake Albert, in Toro, western Uganda, and at Kisumu and Marsabit, Kenya Colony.</p>
				<p>In the northern part of its range, as in the Kassala Province of the Sudan, the standard-wing nightjar is present only in the rains, arriving about the last week in May.<note n="1">Butler, 1905, Ibis, p. 345; 1908," idem, p.240.</note>  In Darfur it appears in mid-April, and does not breed, but returns southward after August.<note n="2">Lynes, 1925, Ibis, p. 372.</note>  Along the southern edge of its range, on the other hand, <taxonName>Macrodipteryx</taxonName> is seen only in the drier half of the year, and there it nests.  About Niangara and Faradje we noted that it arrived annually toward the first of December and remained until April.  So the breeding range extends from the Gambia or Sierra Leone eastward to the Uelle and even to Gofa and Kosha, north of Lake Rudolf, where Neumann collected specimens in January and February.  In the latter month he took a nesting female. The southernmost records from Uganda are all from January to March.</p>
				<p>In this species the coloration is very constant, and adult males are usually darker than females.  Second-year males, without long plumes, have the second primary (9th from outer side) narrowed, a little shorter than the first, with dark pattern less distinct at tip.  Possibly males in

					</figure>  this plumage may breed, for the two taken in February and March showed some enlargement of the gonads.</p>
				<p>The longest spatulate primary I have measured was 535 mm. from tip to base of swollen calamus,<note n="1">See remarks on this feather by Pycraft, 1904, B. B. O. C., XV, p. 22.</note> and its fully webbed portion 170 mm.
<pb n="434" id="t000120-p00440u.tif"/> long.  In nineteen adult males from the Uelle the broad tip measured 153&ndash;197 mm. in length.  The variation is not due to wear, for plumes just growing out have shafts as bare as old ones.</p>
				<p>The juvenal plumage, as shown by nestlings, is lighter than the adult, its pattern finer and less distinct, without oblique buff stripes on scapulars. Most of the upperparts are spotted with black, feather-tips light reddish.  The belly is buff, chest lightly barred with dusky.  From above such young birds remind one of <taxonName>Caprimulgus inornatus</taxonName>, and <taxon><taxonName>Caprimulgus houyi</taxonName> Neumann</taxon><note n="1">1915, O. Mb., p. 73 (Bodanga, E. Cameroon).</note> was described from a specimen in this puzzling plumage.</p>
				<p>When they return to the Uelle district in early December the adult males are renewing their ornamental primaries.  The old plumes were shed in the Sudan, and Lynes tells of finding them on the ground in July.</p>
				<p>

						<figDesc>Fig. 28.  Details of the elongated primary of the adult male of <taxonName>Macrodipteryx longipennis</taxonName>: a, its expanded tip (&times;  1/2); b, the curved base or calamus (&times; 1).</figDesc>
					</figure>
				</p>
				<p>If this is the usual time of molt they must require at least four months for complete growth.  While the new plumes are still enclosed in their basal sheath they lie more or less parallel to the adjacent quills.  Later on, in January, when the sharply bent calamus is formed, the long plumes project outward, above the rest of the wing-feathers.  They are firmly fixed, and only by twisting the outer part of the wing could the plumes be raised during courtship as described by Alexander.<note n="2">1902, Ibis, pp. 357, 358.</note>  This I have never seen done.</p>
				<p>As others have already shown<note n="3">See Kemp, 1905, Ibis, p. 225; Butler, 1905," idem, p. 346; Lynes, 1925," idem, p. 372.</note> the picture in Newton&apos;s `Dictionary of Birds,' p. 641, is most unnatural.  The plumes would have to be bent upward by the surrounding grass, but Lang and I noticed that the birds always sought open spots in the herbage before alighting.</p>
				<p>During the whole of the dry season the standard-wing is one of the common nightjars in the Uelle savannas.  The birds alight at dusk
<pb n="435" id="t000120-p00441u.tif"/> along paths or on freshly burned spots, and when it has rained they like the tops of mushroom-shaped termite nests.  Only seldom do they perch on dead branches of trees.</p>
				<p>Males with elongated primaries fly more slowly than the majority of nightjars, and their dancing racquets&mdash;as has often been remarked&mdash; remind one of two drongos darting down upon a hawk.  Like the other species, <taxonName>Macrodipteryx</taxonName> deserts the roads after the first two hours of darkness, and then comes out again just before daybreak.  Except for an occasional low &quot;cuck&quot; it seems to be mute.  Grass-fires after dark attract small numbers of them, as well as of <taxonName>Scotornis</taxonName>.</p>
				<p>Dissections indicated breeding from the end of January to early April.  The eggs are laid on high ground, without nesting material, in sets of two.  Their ground-color is pinkish buff, with spots of brown most numerous and heaviest on the larger end.  The dimensions of a set from Faradje, March 25, are 25 &times; 18.7 and 25.9 &times; 18.9 mm.  Bannerman&apos;s measurements for the species are 24.1&ndash;29 mm. &times; 18.7&ndash;21.</p>
				<p>On March 4, 1912, a female <taxonName>Macrodipteryx</taxonName> was found sitting on two eggs in a spot where a fire had passed two weeks before, exposed to the full glare of the sun.  Twelve days later two young had been hatched and had moved off about five feet to the base of a bush.  They were clothed in buffy down, mottled above with black.  The mother would flee but a short distance, dropping down in plain view to spread her wings and flutter about.</p>
				<p>Eleven out of sixteen stomachs held beetles, often in numbers, while nine stomachs contained small hemiptera, equally numerous.  The other insects devoured included 11 small grasshoppers, 6 moths, 6 winged driver ants, 4 other winged ants, 7 leaf-hoppers, a few small hymenoptera, 2 small flies, 2 small cicadas, and one earwig.  Winged termites filled two stomachs, and one mosquito was seen in a bird&apos;s throat, as well as an ant with jaws buried firmly in the flesh.</p>

				<pb n="437" id="t000120-p00443c.tif"/>
				<p>The generic distinction of <taxonName>Cosmetornis</taxonName> from <taxonName>Macrodipteryx</taxonName> is based almost entirely on the form of the wing and its ornamental quills in adult males.  It would be almost as well to unite the two.  There can be no doubt that they are intimately related, <taxonName idx_name="Macrodipteryx longipennis">M. longipennis</taxonName> having evolved north of the forest belt, and <taxonName idx_name="Cosmetornis vexillarius">C. vexillarius</taxonName> to the south of it.  I can see no very close affinity between these two African nightjars and <taxonName>Eleothreptus</taxonName> of South America.</p>
				<p>Coloration is much less constant in <taxonName idx_name="Cosmetornis vexillarius">vexillarius</taxonName> than in <taxonName idx_name="Macrodipteryx longipennis">longipennis</taxonName>, and a few adult males of the former are strongly marked with rufous above, especially on the crown.  Adult females are less variable. Young males in March, which still retain the soft under tail-coverts of the juvenal plumage and are not more than five and a half months old, have already molted the first (innermost) primary; and this has been replaced by a relatively large blackish feather.  It may be that males of <taxonName>Cosmetornis</taxonName> are more precocious than those of <taxonName>Macrodipteryx</taxonName> and assume their nuptial plumage before the end of the first year.</p>

				</p>
				<p>One of the most extraordinary things about the pennant-winged nightjar is its extensive and regular migration.  All examples found in the equatorial forest or north of it are migrants, for the breeding range is entirely in the southern savannas, from Angola, the southern half of Lake Tanganyika, and Tanganyika Territory south to Damaraland and the Transvaal.  To that area it is restricted from October to early February. In the latter month a northward migration begins which takes the great majority of the birds, young and old, to the grasslands on the opposite side of the equator.  There they spend the early part of the rainy season.  Then from July to September they make their return journey southward to breed.</p>
				<p>The records from the Cameroon and Congo forests all fall within the two periods of migration, when the birds spend the day in clearings or any natural openings in the forest.  The first one I ever saw was an adult male at dusk over Lukolela, on July 18, 1909.  Two days later a specimen was secured at a wood-post below Bolengi.  Months passed
<pb n="438" id="t000120-p00444u.tif"/> before we found the species again, some females in native farms near Medje, the following March.</p>
				<p>In October, 1910, we left the Ituri forest for the savannas of the Uelle, and there we saw no pennant-wings until March 13, 1911, when I shot an immature male and an adult male with broken streamers.  In 1912, the first one was observed on March 11.  During three years we ascertained that the &quot;pennants&quot; are regularly broken short before the male birds reach the Ituri and the Uelle.  In May or early June they are shed, and the new ones grow so slowly that their basal sheath is usually still present in August.  Many of the males have returned to their nesting grounds before the growth of these plumes is completed.</p>
				<p>From the latter part of May to the first of September, in the Uelle, is the season when pennant-winged nightjars display themselves aloft. At sundown they leave their refuge in the bushes amid the grasslands where they have been squatting on the ground or some flat stone, and start out to feed.  At first they fly high, even a full hundred yards above the earth, a female not infrequently following in the wake of an adult male.  Later in the evening they come lower, but rest on the roads mainly in the middle of the night, and at dawn are seen flying actively again. When put up in the daytime this nightjar may take refuge in a low tree, sitting more or less lengthwise on a bough, otherwise it seems never to perch.</p>
				<p>When winged termites are swarming at dusk it is not uncommon to see a flock of ten to thirty <taxonName>Cosmetornis</taxonName> of both sexes gather over the spot. These insects are their favorite food.  At such times I heard the only note they gave in the Uelle, a single hoarse syllable.  Of all the males we collected there none had its &quot;pennants&quot; fully grown.  The longest plumes were those of a male from Garamba on July 10, measuring 593 mm.  The full-grown plumes of two males from the Katanga measure 725 and 740 mm. but 610&ndash;660 mm. is the usual maximum.</p>
				<p>While pennant-wings are still numerous at Faradje in August, the southward migration has already begun. The birds have become excessively fat.  We saw the last adult male there on September 3 and the last female on September 26.  Near Avakubi in 1914 migrants on their way north were again collected between February 24 and March 20. During their return trip they were noted between July 23 and August 16.  When traveling southward they were often seen in pairs, the female following the male; and their direction was clearly south or southwest.</p>
				<p>My paper of 1916 on the migration of <taxonName>Cosmetornis</taxonName> was based on the foregoing observations and all the published records with dates.  Since
<pb n="439" id="t000120-p00445c.tif"/> that year nothing has come to my notice that does not tend to confirm my conclusions.</p>
				<p>In 1926, I found pennant-wings common at Kasenyi on Lake Albert in the latter part of August, but saw none there after September 2, nor any on the northern shore of Lake Edward in January, 1927.  At Beni in February, I promised Sage they would soon reappear, and on February 23 we took a male with broken pennants.  During March a number of others were seen along the road through the mountains west of Lake Edward, some at an altitude of 7600 feet.  By the end of that month the northward migration seemed finished, and none was seen near Rutshuru or in the Rutshuru Plain in April and May.  In July none was seen in the Ruzizi Valley, or in early August along the Lualaba River, so I believe that few remain south of the forest between May and early August.</p>
				<p>At Lukolela in 1931, I caught an immature male of <taxonName>Cosmetornis</taxonName> in my hand on February 21, with the aid of a flashlight.  Four more examples were seen there between March 3 and 24.  So the dates of passage are much the same there as in the Ituri.</p>
				<p>Dr. Schouteden&apos;s four adult males from Elisabethville were taken in April, but the Congo Museum has no specimens from the southern Congo after that month until July 30, when a male was taken by Father Callewaert at Luluabourg.  There is also a female from Luluabourg on August 4.  From Kinda, Lulua district, the earliest date is August 5, and from Kanzenze, Katanga, August 18.  These indicate the approximate dates of arrival.</p>
				<p>In Marungu B&ouml;hm found <taxonName>Cosmetornis</taxonName> very abundant in September, and on September 8 took the first set of two eggs.  In the same district Rockefeller and Murphy collected a number, including females and young, between February 22 and March 18.  The first migrants reach the Uelle before the last stragglers quit the breeding area.  The pennants are not molted on the breeding grounds, but many of them break off and are found lying on the ground.  The voice of the male on its nesting ground is described as a faint piping or twittering squeak, given in flight.</p>
				<p>This nightjar does not breed in the Lower Congo, nor probably in the Kasai or northern Tanganyika district.  Near Sandoa in the southern Lulua, Lynes found a female with two eggs, half-incubated, on September 8.  Eggs have been reported from Matabeleland as late as November 29.</p>
				<p>The eggs of <taxonName>Cosmetornis</taxonName> are pinkish white to buffy salmon-pink with
<pb n="440" id="t000120-p00446c.tif"/> rusty reddish spots or blotches and secondary violet-gray, measurements 26.4&ndash;34 mm. &times; 19.4&ndash;22.8.</p>
				<p>Three stomachs of migrating birds from the forest area contained numbers of beetles, some crickets, and a few small grasshoppers.  In the case of fifteen other birds from the Uelle, seven stomachs were filled mainly with winged termites.  While beetles were present in thirteen cases, they were usually few in number and mainly of small size.  Other insects noted were 15 small hemiptera, 7 small grasshoppers, some winged ants, 4 leaf-hoppers, 2 small cicadas, 3 roaches, a small mantis, an earwig, and a moth.  The average dimensions of insects eaten by pennant-wings are not great, and I still believe that their fondness for winged termites is correlated with their migration.</p>

				<p>SPECIMENS.&mdash;Avakubi, 2 &female;, Aug. 24.  Ngayu, 6 &male;, July 28, Dec. 12, 15, 19; 4 &female;, July 27, 28, Dec. 15, 18.  Niangara, &female;, June 1.</p>
				<p>ADULTS.&mdash;Iris dark brown, bill black, feet dusky purplish.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;Sierra Leone eastward to the Cameroon and Upper Congo forest.  To the southward it reaches the Lower Congo, and it has been found on Fernando Po.  <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Ch&aelig;tura sabini sabini">C. s. sabini</taxonName> Gray</taxon>, known only from Sierra Leone, is said to have the wing 132 mm. long. <taxonName idx_name="Ch&aelig;tura sabini ogowensis">C. s. ogowensis</taxonName> differs only by its supposedly shorter wings, 115&ndash;126 mm., and is found from Fernando Po, the Gaboon, and Landana eastward across the forested Cameroon and Congo to the Upper Uelle, the Semliki Valley, and probably to the northern Kasai district.  <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Columba thomensis">C. thomensis</taxonName> Hartert</taxon> of S&atilde;o Tom&eacute; is a very close ally, smaller and with less white.</p>
				<p>At Avakubi in the Ituri forest Sabine&apos;s swift was the most abundant of the spine-tailed species, as it probably is throughout the heavier forests of the Upper Congo.  At Ngayu parties of a dozen or more used to be seen passing over, especially in the morning before the sun was high, and again toward sunset.  If they gave any call-note it was so weak as to escape my ear.</p>
				<p>About Niangara this swift was not common, and we saw it only near some swampy woods.  A small flock was noted along the Uelle River between Niangara and Dungu, but none were ever seen farther to the northeast.</p>
				<p>The range seems to stop at the eastern margin of the forest.  Along the road between Irumu and Beni the species was common in September, 1926, and at Masimango&apos;s in the forest east of the Semliki River I saw a party of ten on February 10, 1927.</p>
				<p>About Lukolela in 1930&ndash;31, they were observed occasionally in groups of two to eight, and near Ganda Sundi in the Mayombe two couples were noticed on April 20, 1931.</p>
				<p>Sabine&apos;s swift breeds and roosts in hollow forest trees, Bates having secured two nests, shaped like half-cups, made of small bits of twigs glued together, at Bitye in southern Cameroon.  One set was of two, the other of three, pure white eggs, measuring 17&ndash;18 mm. &times; 12&ndash;12.5.<note n="1">Ibis, 1911, p. 517.  For the nesting of two Indian species of <taxonName>Ch&aelig;tura</taxonName>, see Stewart, 1913, Journ. Bombay Nat. Hist. Soc., XXII, pp. 393, 394.</note>
				</p>
				<p>In the northeastern Congo the breeding season cannot extend through
<pb n="442" id="t000120-p00448c.tif"/> any considerable part of the year, for only one of our specimens showed enlargement of the reproductive organs&mdash;a female from Niangara, on June 1.  It seems almost certain that in the Ituri the breeding season must fall within the months between January and June, a period during which we secured no specimens.</p>
				<p>With regard to the usual food we can be more precise, for of eight individuals (from three different localities), the stomachs in every case were found to contain only winged ants, often being completely filled with them.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;Senegal to Angola, and eastward to the Uelle, Mombasa on the East Coast, and the Zambesi River.  Four races are recognized, differing in the size of the white patch on the abdomen, the scaly or streaky pattern of throat and fore-neck, and the blackness of the upperparts.<note n="1">Grant and Mackworth-Praed, 1937, B.

On the south it reaches the central Kasai district.  <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Ch&aelig;tura ussheri benguellensis">C. u. benguellensis</taxonName> Neumann</taxon> is found in northern and central Angola, while <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Ch&aelig;tura ussheri stictil&aelig;ma">C. u. stictil&aelig;ma</taxonName> (Reichenow)</taxon> is locally distributed from Mt. Kenya and Mombasa south to Zumbo on the Zambesi.  The Kwango district is about the only part of the Congo where <taxonName idx_name="Ch&aelig;tura ussheri benguellensis">benguellensis</taxonName> may possibly occur.  It differs from <taxonName idx_name="Ch&aelig;tura ussheri sharpei">sharpei</taxonName> in the more streaked, less scaly pattern of the fore-neck, and by its browner upperparts.  Its wing is apparently a little shorter than that of <taxonName idx_name="Ch&aelig;tura ussheri sharpei">sharpei</taxonName>, the latter measuring 142&ndash;152 mm.</p>
				<pb n="443" id="t000120-p00449c.tif"/>
				<p><taxonName>Ch&aelig;tura ussheri sharpei</taxonName> is a rather common bird over the whole lowland forest area of the Congo, extending well out into savannas with gallery forests, but it does not ascend above 5400 feet in the highlands. This is usually the first of the spine-tails to attract attention, because of its visits to villages and posts.  It does not travel in flocks.  Pairs are the rule, and seldom are six seen together.  Often they fly low over an open clearing merely to feed, at other times they come closer about the houses, in which occasionally they nest.</p>
				<p>At Ganda Sundi in the Mayombe, I saw a few of these swifts, and the Congo Museum has a mummified specimen from Lukula.  At Boma they are common, and they were noted also at Leopoldville and Lukolela. In the Ituri district we saw them frequently, even along the road between Irumu and Beni.  A pair was seen at Djugu on the Lendu Plateau, and the specimen taken between Faradje and Aba was flying on the outskirts of a strip of heavy forest.  Father Callewaert collected a pair for the American Museum at Luluabourg in the Kasai.</p>
				<p>Dissections, as well as their behavior, showed that in the region from Avakubi to Medje breeding takes place in January as well as in July and August.  At Lukolela a male in full readiness for reproduction was collected on August 28.</p>
				<p>These swifts undoubtedly nest in hollow trees, and near Avakubi in March we watched a pair dropping into the hollow core of a great tall stump, but no nest could be found there.  Vacant houses are occasionally chosen also as nesting places.  At Okondo&apos;s village near Niangara in early July a couple were flying about the great meeting hall as though they might have a nest under the peak of the roof.  At Avakubi in April a pair was found clinging side by side to the inner wall of an empty house.</p>
				<p>At Babonde in July, I discovered an occupied nest in a rest-house that was used only occasionally by Europeans.  Between the gabled roof and the front wall there was a large open space for the entry of the swifts, and the nest was glued to the inner wall at a height of fifteen feet. Although the set of four pure white eggs was complete, the male was carrying a small dry twig in his beak, to be added to the half-saucer-shaped nest.  This was built mainly of small twigs glued together, though the part closest to the wall consisted of small bits of dry banana leaf.  Both male and female birds had salivary glands highly developed, as is the case only in the breeding season.  Their four eggs measured 20.6&ndash;21 mm. &times; 13.8&ndash;14.3.</p>
				<p>These nesting birds approached the house in long, graceful arcs, and kept quite silent.  The voice of <taxonName idx_name="Ch&aelig;tura ussheri">C. ussheri</taxonName> is a rasping &quot;k&abreve;k-k-k-k,&quot;
<pb n="444" id="t000120-p00450c.tif"/> which I could hear only up to fifty yards.  Its flight is more like that of <taxonName>Micropus affinis</taxonName> than that of <taxonName>Neafrapus cassini</taxonName>.</p>
				<p>At Coquilhatville in 1931, I found an abandoned nest of <taxonName idx_name="Ch&aelig;tura ussheri sharpei">C. ussheri sharpei</taxonName> ten feet up on the inner wall of an unused garage.  Old feathers on the floor below confirmed the" identification.</p>
				<p>Without exception the eight stomachs of this swift which I have examined contained winged ants.  Often they were entirely filled with them, and the only other insects recognized were three flies.</p>

				<p>SPECIMEN.&mdash;Avakubi, &male;, Aug. 15.</p>
				<p>ADULT.&mdash;Iris dark brown; bill black; feet bluish, shading to dusky brown on tips of toes and claws.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;Known only from the Ituri Forest.</p>
				<p>This large dark swift, of which but two specimens have been taken, is related to <taxonName idx_name="Ch&aelig;tura ussheri">C. ussheri</taxonName>, and has a similar scaly pattern on fore-neck and chest, though even more extensive, and no white on either rump or abdomen. The wing of the type measures 164 mm., tail 49.5.  Count Gyldenstolpe&apos;s specimen, also a male, had the wing 165 mm., tail 50.</p>
				<p>The type specimen was one of two or three flying about over the Ituri River, some two miles above Avakubi, in company with several <taxonName>Neafrapus cassini</taxonName>.  On a few other occasions in this vicinity I saw large swifts I believed to be <taxonName idx_name="Ch&aelig;tura melanopygia">melanopygia</taxonName>, but did not succeed in killing any more. In July, 1921, Count Gyldenstolpe obtained a second example, and reported that he saw others on several occasions, flying over clearings in the Ituri Forest west of Irumu.  There is no reason to think that the species is restricted to the Ituri, and I expect that sooner or later it will turn up in other parts of the Upper Congo forest.</p>
				<p>Our specimen had the testes enlarged as though certainly breeding, and its stomach contained a number of winged ants.</p>

Lisboa, XII, No. xlvi, pp. 93, 105</taxon> (type locality: Quissange, Benguella).</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;From the Ugalla River, east of Lake Tanganyika, south to the Zambesi at Tete and Sesheke, and probably to Beira; thence west to Quissange in Benguella, Cassualalla in northern Angola, and the central Kasai district of the Congo.</p>
				<p>Both in color and pattern this small swift is a copy of <taxonName>Neafrapus cassini</taxonName>, save that there are no fine dark streaks on throat or breast.  Even the proportions of wing and tail are similar, though the wing here measures but 121&ndash;130 mm., and the tail 18&ndash;20 (inclusive of the spiny tips of the rectrices).  Three males from northern Angola have wings 121&ndash;122 mm., a male and a female from the Kasai 122.5 and 122 mm., and a male from the Upper Katanga 130 mm.  I doubt the distinctness of <taxon><taxonName>Notafrapus sheppardi</taxonName> Roberts</taxon>,<note n="1">1922, Ann. Transvaal Mus., VIII, p. 218 (Beira).</note> since it does not differ in color from <taxonName idx_name="Neafrapus b&ouml;hmi">b&ouml;hmi</taxonName>, and the measurements given are only slightly different: wing 116&ndash;123, tail 20&ndash;22 mm.</p>
				<p>This small stub-tailed swift is rather common in the Upper Katanga, where I collected a male at the Etoile Mine in August, 1927.  It was toward the end of July at Elisabethville that Admiral Lynes found it, and at the end of August at Kayoyo in the southern Lulua district.  The species extends into the Kasai district as far as Luluabourg, where Father Callewaert obtained a male in September and a female in December, 1924.</p>
				<p>They feed in very small parties, often only two or three; and their flight is as irregular as that of their large counterpart, <taxonName idx_name="Neafrapus cassini">cassini</taxonName>.  The wings appear unusually broad for a swift&apos;s, so their erratic movements suggest somewhat the flight of a butterfly.  No doubt they nest in hollows in trees of the thickly wooded savanna.</p>

				<p>ADULTS.&mdash;Iris very dark brown; bill black; feet purplish black, or dark blue becoming blackish on toes.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;From Fernando Po, Bipindi in southern Cameroon, the Gaboon Coast, and Landana, eastward across the Congo forest to Poko on the Bomokandi River and to the neighborhood of Beni.  At Ganda Sundi in the Mayombe I saw four within a few days, and at Lukolela it is of regular occurrence.  Very probably its range extends to the upper Lukenie River and the forested Manyema.  On the northeastern edge of the forest we never observed it beyond Bafwabaka and Medje, so it would seem more closely restricted to the heavy forest than either <taxonName>Ch&aelig;tura ussheri</taxonName> or <taxonName idx_name="Ch&aelig;tura sabini">sabini</taxonName>.</p>
				<p>Seven males from the northeastern Congo have wings 150&ndash;161 mm., tails 23.5&ndash;27.5 mm.  Three females from the same region: wings 155&ndash; 161, tails 24&ndash;26.  The wings of four specimens from the Gaboon measure 146&ndash;155 mm.</p>
				<p>With its long wings and stubby tail, <taxonName>Neafrapus cassini</taxonName> exaggerates all that is peculiar to the flight of swifts, until it seems almost as though its wings were out of joint.  Its progress is nevertheless extremely rapid, and I was much surprised at finding one in the crop of a peregrine falcon. One morning in early January I watched a gathering of fully forty of these swifts over the Ituri River at Bosobangi, with only a very few <taxonName>Ch&aelig;tura sabini</taxonName> about; but usually it is the smaller species that shows the larger numbers, while more than a half-dozen <taxonName idx_name="Neafrapus cassini">cassini</taxonName> is exceptional.</p>
				<p>Only once did I secure good evidence as to where this species nests. Near Avakubi, in late April, one was seen to fly out of a tree standing alongside a forest road.  The trunk was hollow, opening below from the ground up to a height of eight feet.  Examination of the ground beneath disclosed a piece of white egg-shell and a couple of old feathers from a swift.  In a forest clearing near the Loya River, south of Irumu, on September 29, 1926, I watched a swift of this species as it dropped into the hollow top of a tree which had been broken off by the fall of its neighbors.  This of course did not prove that nesting was in progress just then.  I have no evidence that this species ever attempted to nest in houses.</p>
				<pb n="447" id="t000120-p00453c.tif"/>
				<p>In the Ituri district we took non-breeding individuals in November, December, and January, and others ready to breed in July and September. This indicates that nesting is carried on during the rains, commencing perhaps as early as April.</p>
				<p>The contents of nine stomachs showed that the food consists mainly of winged ants, which were found in eight of them, often in such numbers as to fill the stomach.  The ninth stomach contained many small black beetles, of which one other bird had eaten a few.  Winged termites were also found mixed with ants in one case.</p>

				<p>ADULTS.&mdash;Iris dark brown, bill black, toes dusky brown.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;Almost the whole of Africa, islands in Gulf of Guinea, India, China, Malay Peninsula, Sumatra, and Borneo. Five or six races are recognized.  <taxonName idx_name="Micropus affinis affinis">M. a. affinis</taxonName> occupies the western and central provinces of India to Deccan, also southern Arabia, and Africa from the Gambia, Northern Nigeria, and Abyssinia south to Cape Province.  It is found along the western coast as well as in eastern Africa, but is very rare within the limits of the Upper Congo forest. Birds from tropical Africa have often been separated as <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Micropus affinis abessynicus">M. a. abessynicus</taxonName> (Streubel)</taxon>, but the difference is exceedingly slight.  In North Africa dwells a lighter race, <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Micropus affinis galilejensis">M. a. galilejensis</taxonName> (Antinori)</taxon>, which extends south to Timbuktu and Asben.  <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Micropus affinis bannermani">M. a. bannermani</taxonName> Hartert</taxon><note n="1">1928, Nov. Zool., XXXIV, p. 365 (Pedroma, S&atilde;o Tom&eacute;.)</note> of S&atilde;o Tom&eacute;, Principe, and Fernando Po is blacker in color than typical <taxonName idx_name="Micropus affinis affinis">affinis</taxonName>, with wings 134&ndash;142.5 mm.  Those of African specimens of <taxonName idx_name="Micropus affinis affinis">affinis</taxonName> measure 122&ndash;137 mm.</p>
				<p>The localized distribution of this square-tailed swift in the Congo is doubtless due to the kind of nesting sites it requires, overhanging rocks or substantial buildings.  I have found it at only three localities in the Congo, and no others are on record.</p>
				<p>About the hills near Matadi, <taxonName idx_name="Micropus affinis">M. affinis</taxonName> is seen in some numbers, and in December, 1914, there were two large clusters of nests beneath a high overhanging rock along the river just above the town.  The specimen collected there was in breeding condition.</p>
				<p>Between Dungu and Faradje, near a stream called the Gangu, there are several rocky hills about 200 feet high.  One of them has an overhanging end, and there in February, 1913, I found a great slab of nests attached beneath the almost horizontal surface of the rock. They
<pb n="449" id="t000120-p00455c.tif"/> seemed rather old, and lower down, in a crack, were several more that looked newer.  A few swifts were flying about in the afternoon, and at sundown twenty or thirty assembled, preparatory to going to roost. They gave some &quot;churring&quot; notes, not loud.  Some of the specimens collected there had gonads enlarged, but I doubt if they were breeding actively at that time.  The nests we dislodged were empty, and had been constructed of bits of grass, plant-down, and feathers, especially those of fruit-pigeons and of the swifts themselves.</p>
				<p>The only place in the forest area where I have ever seen this species is at Coquilhatville.  In March, 1931, some thirty pairs were breeding under the verandah of the brick post office, where they had built four groups of nests in the corners.  There were also four isolated nests beneath iron eaves near a side door of the cathedral.  One nest was found to have two white eggs, others held one or two young each.  At night a few adults could be seen clinging on the outside of the nests, but the majority were inside.  When disturbed they gave a weak trilling note. The nests at Coquilhatville were also made of grass and feathers.  Mud certainly is never used in their construction, and they are almost always well closed, with an entrance at one side, occasionally prolonged as a short tube.</p>
				<p>The season of reproduction is probably very long, for in West Africa, north of the equator, eggs or young have been found from September at least to March.  Three eggs are sometimes laid, and measurements given by Bannerman are 20.4&ndash;23.5 mm. &times; 13.7&ndash;15.  Eggs found by Austin Roberts<note n="1">1926, Ann. Transvaal Mus., XI, p. 235.</note> at the Modder River, Orange River State, in February measured 22.5&ndash;24.5 mm. &times; 13.8&ndash;15.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;From Darfur, the Blue Nile, and Abyssinia south to the eastern Congo border, Kilimanjaro, the Zambesi, and the Rustenburg
<pb n="450" id="t000120-p00456c.tif"/> district, Transvaal.  Also west to the Congo mouth, but not in the region of heavy forest.</p>
				<p>The validity of the three races, <taxonName idx_name="Micropus horus beirensis">beirensis</taxonName>, <taxonName idx_name="Micropus horus australis">australis</taxonName>, and <taxonName idx_name="Micropus horus finschii">finschii</taxonName>, recognized by Austin Roberts<note n="1">1929, Ann. Transvaal Mus., XIII, p. 73; 1935," idem, XVI, p. 107.</note> in southern Africa, seems to me very doubtful.  Four Abyssinian specimens have wings 149&ndash;160 mm., and are not smaller than those of the Transvaal.  Eight specimens from Kenya Colony and the eastern Congo have wings 143&ndash;157 mm., tails 53.5&ndash;59, with depth of fork in tail 10&ndash;18 mm.  Females average slightly smaller than males.</p>
				<p>Recent records indicate that this white-rumped swift may occur rather commonly along the Albertine Rift and perhaps across all the savannas of the southern Congo.  Without securing a specimen it is next to impossible to distinguish <taxonName idx_name="Micropus horus">horus</taxonName> from <taxonName idx_name="Micropus caffer">M. caffer</taxonName>, in spite of the longer tail of the latter.  Sometimes <taxonName idx_name="Micropus horus">horus</taxonName> mingles with flocks of other swifts as they feed, yet on August 26, 1926, I found a flock of fifteen or twenty of this species along the escarpment west of Kasenyi on Lake Albert, and secured two.  Dr. Schouteden obtained three specimens on Lake Kivu in January, and Rockefeller and Murphy collected a female at Kitendwe, Marungu, 6050 feet, on February 23, 1929.  Over a small grassy plain back of Lukolela a flock of about thirty appeared on October 10, 1930, from which I shot four.  They were not in condition to breed, and were feeding on winged ants.</p>
				<p>L. Petit,<note n="2">1885, Ornis, p. 585; 1899, Mem. Soc. Zool. France, XII, pp. 74, 75.</note> who collected this swift at Landana, was surely mistaken about its breeding in nests of swallows on a rocky cliff.  The eggs and young of <taxonName idx_name="Micropus horus">horus</taxonName> have been found by other naturalists<note n="3">Roberts, 1926, Ann. Transvaal Mus., XI, p. 235; 1935," idem, XVI, p. 107.  Belcher. 1928, Ibis, p. 9.</note> in tunnels in banks which may have been dug by bank swallows or bee-eaters.  The eggs, laid on a pad of hair, hay, and feathers, are two in a set, glossy white and elongate, measuring 21.8&ndash;22.7 mm. &times; 14.5&ndash;15.  In the Transvaal, Roberts found several nests in the same bank on May 2, Belcher reported a nest from the Zambesi mouth on September 17, and Lynes mentioned a breeding male from Darfur in June.  I collected a male ready to breed on July 11 near Naivasha, Kenya Colony.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;From Landana south to the vicinity of Lobito Bay, Angola.<note n="1">A supposed occurrence at Zomba, Nyasaland, was based on a misidentification.  See Belcher 1930, `Birds of Nyasaland,' p. 152.</note>  Far from being a race of <taxonName idx_name="Micropus apus">M. apus</taxonName>, the Loanda swift is almost exactly similar to <taxonName idx_name="Micropus horus">M. horus</taxonName> except that it has no white on its rump, and the throat is not so pure white.

				<p>Only a very few specimens of <taxonName idx_name="Micropus toulsoni">toulsoni</taxonName> have ever been taken, but it is evident that this swift must occur at the Congo mouth.  The British Museum specimen came from Landana, not from the Lower Congo.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;From Cape Town north to the southern and eastern edges of the Congo forest, through eastern Africa to Eritrea and Darfur, also in the savannas of the Upper Uelle.  Little more than accidental in the Congo forest.</p>
				<p><taxon><taxonName idx_name="Micropus caffer caffer">M. c. caffer</taxonName> (Lichtenstein)</taxon>, from south of the Zambesi, has wings of 150&ndash;170 mm.  It is believed to be migratory, and may possibly occur in the southern Congo between April and September.  <taxonName idx_name="Micropus caffer ansorgei">M. c. ansorgei</taxonName> of Angola, Lower Congo, and Landana, is somewhat blacker on the crown and perhaps more bluish on back and upper tail-coverts than the other races.  Its wings measure 132&ndash;146 mm.  <taxonName idx_name="Micropus caffer streubelii">M. c. streubelii</taxonName>, with wings 130&ndash;142 mm., ranges from Eritrea, Abyssinia, and the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan to the northeastern and eastern Congo, Uganda, Kenya Colony, and Tanganyika Territory.  It does not ascend forested mountains, but occurs in East Africa up to 6000 feet.</p>
				<p>In the Congo <taxonName idx_name="Micropus caffer streubelii">streubelii</taxonName> is found in the savannas of the Uelle and those about Lake Edward.  Near Lemera, west of the Ruzizi Valley, I have also seen a swift of this species.  The single occurrence at Avakubi seems purely accidental, a non-breeding bird that was feeding with a large flock of swallows and some European swifts.</p>
				<p>An occasional individual might be seen anywhere in the grasslands of the Uelle, but they were of regular occurrence only about rocky hills,
<pb n="452" id="t000120-p00458c.tif"/> where they were sure to find swallows' nests for their own use.  At Aba we noticed only one, but at Mt. Ataramba near Dungu in the latter part of June six pairs were flying about the steep rocks overlooking the river, coming in toward the fissures where <taxonName>Hirundo abyssinica unitatis</taxonName> undoubtedly nests.  There were only two pairs of these swallows about at the time.  Near the foot of Mt. Gaima in early August two pairs of <taxonName idx_name="Micropus caffer streubelii">streubelii</taxonName> were flying about some huge boulders where under an overhanging ledge there were a couple of nests of the same streak-breasted swallows.</p>
				<p>This was the time of year when they nested, for on July 3, 1913, at Nala, I found a pair occupying a nest built by <taxonName>Hirundo semirufa gordoni</taxonName> in an empty house.  The exterior of this nest looked so fresh that I think the builders had been driven off before they could use it, and they now had a second nest in another house.  Some dry grass in the nest had evidently been placed there by the swallows, but the swifts had added a soft bed of plant-down from the seed-pods of rubber trees (<taxonName>Kibatalia</taxonName>), as well as feathers.  They had also lined the whole inside walls, right out to the edge of the tubular entrance, with feathers glued on by their saliva.  The feathers had come from white chickens, fruit-pigeons, and weavers, as well as from the swifts themselves.  A small bit of rag and a pinch of green moss were also noticed, and all these materials were undoubtedly secured in flight.  The eggs were two, pure white, and measured 22.2 &times; 14.5 and 22.6 &times; 14.3 mm.</p>
				<p>At Jinja, Uganda, I have found eggs and young of <taxonName idx_name="Micropus caffer streubelii">M. c. streubelii</taxonName> during July, in old nests of <taxonName>Hirundo angolensis</taxonName>.  Near Kasindi in January a non-breeding pair was spending the night in an old swallows' nest beneath an overhanging rock, probably built by <taxonName>Hirundo rufula emini</taxonName>.</p>
				<p>In the diet of this swift, winged ants take first place.  Three out of four stomachs were filled with them, and the only other insect we could recognize was a small hemipter.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;From the Portuguese Congo to northern Angola, and supposedly eastward across the savannas of the southern Congo. In the Congo Museum there are two adults from Boma, wings 133 and 140 mm.  Specimens from Landana are said to have wings of 132 and
<pb n="453" id="t000120-p00459c.tif"/> 135 mm.  Those of northern Angola have them 140&ndash;146 mm., and an adult from Kasongo in the Congo Museum has the wing 140.  We may expect this swift to occur in the Kasai district, but it is difficult to say what race Mouritz saw in the southern Katanga.</p>
				<p>At Boma, where <taxonName>Hirundo abyssinica</taxonName> nested on the verandah of the American Consulate, Mr. Harry McBride told me that at times the swallows were evicted from their homes by a dark-colored swift.  At that same town, some years later, Doctor Rodhain collected a nestling of M. c. ansorgei, with wings nearly full-grown, in August.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;Bates&apos;s black swift was known only from one locality in forested southern Cameroon until Count Gyldenstolpe secured one male specimen at Kartushi in the forested section of the Semliki Valley.  It was shot from a party of swifts flying over.  It might therefore be expected that <taxonName idx_name="Micropus batesi">M. batesi</taxonName> would be generally distributed throughout the forests of the Upper Congo.  Such is probably not the case, for it is a small swift, easily recognized.  Bates&apos;s type, a female, had the wing 132 mm., tail 68, with depth of fork in tail 27.  Gyldenstolpe&apos;s male had wing 132 mm., tail 71.</p>
				<p>Along the forest road from Irumu to the new post of Beni, during the two days' march before reaching Moera, in early October, 1926, I noticed them flying over on at least three different occasions, perhaps twenty to thirty individuals in all.  No specimen could be secured, they kept too high above the trees; but their small size, blackish color, and unusually rapid wing-beats are distinctive.  The tail is rather long, and is usually held closed so that the fork is not apparent.  Nowhere else have I seen the species.</p>
				<p>Bates<note n="1">1905, Ibis, p. 91.</note> reported that the type specimen was caught alive in an abandoned swallows' nest plastered beneath an overhanging rock in a patch of forest.  It had two white eggs, about 21 &times; 14.5 mm.</p>

				<p>As compared with skins of <taxonName idx_name="Micropus unicolor poensis">poensis</taxonName> from Fernando Po, the three male specimens collected by Rockefeller and Murphy at Kitutu, just west of the mountains northwest of Uvira, are slightly more blackish on crown, back, wings, and posterior underparts.  Their wings measure 127&ndash;136 mm., equaling almost exactly those of Fernando Po specimens.  Tails 58&ndash;72 mm. long, with depth of fork 21&ndash;31 mm.  Fernando Po birds have tails 63&ndash;70 mm., depth of fork 24&ndash;30 mm.  The outer rectrices of Kitutu birds have slightly narrower tips than those of specimens from Fernando Po.</p>
				<p>These Kivu birds are closer to <taxonName idx_name="Micropus unicolor poensis">poensis</taxonName> than to <taxonName idx_name="Micropus unicolor achimodzi">achimodzi</taxonName>, with the type of which I have compared them.

				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;Madeira, Canary Islands, southern Europe, to Egypt, Somaliland, and Northwest India.

It was collected on November 16.  The only Congo specimen of which I know is a non-breeding female which I obtained near the upper Semliki River on January 26, 1927.  Its wing measures 157 mm., tail 65, with fork 19 mm. deep.  I regret that I have not been able to compare it directly with the type, but feel that they must belong to the same race.  My example was feeding over a grassy plain in company with a number of palm-swifts.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;Europe and Asia, from Great Britain to eastern China, breeding also in North Africa and from Abyssinia to Kenya Colony.  Palaearctic birds migrate to South Africa. In my opinion there are scarcely more than three races, for I regard the <taxonName idx_name="Micropus barbatus">barbatus</taxonName> group as specifically distinct.<note n="1">See however Meinertzhagen, 1922, Ibis, pp. 36&ndash;43; Hartert and Steinbacher, 1935, `V&ouml;g. pal. Fauna,' Ergbd., p. 354.</note>  <taxonName idx_name="Micropus apus apus">M. a. apus</taxonName> breeds over the whole of Europe north to 70&Degree; in Scandinavia and Archangel in Russia, also from Morocco to Tunis.  <taxonName idx_name="Micropus apus pekinensis">M. a. pekinensis</taxonName> breeds from the southern Caucasus and Persia to eastern China.  In this eastern race all the upperparts, but especially the forehead, are lighter than in the European form.  The wings, and the secondaries in particular, are of a lighter, grayer brown, and the white throat-patch extends higher up toward the cheeks.  <taxonName idx_name="Micropus apus shelleyi">M. a. shelleyi</taxonName>, which breeds from northern Abyssinia to Kenya Colony, resembles <taxonName idx_name="Micropus apus pekinensis">pekinensis</taxonName> in color, though sometimes slightly blacker, but has wings only 150&ndash;159 mm. long.  The wings of <taxonName idx_name="Micropus apus apus">apus</taxonName> and <taxonName idx_name="Micropus apus pekinensis">pekinensis</taxonName> collected by me in the Congo measure 162&ndash;174 mm.</p>
				<p>In life the eastern and western Palaearctic races cannot be distinguished. In the Congo they may mingle in the same flock.  While these swifts pass the northern winter in Africa, the great majority of them spend the middle of that season south of the equator.  Thus in the northeastern Congo they are seen at two separate periods while passing through.  They arrive early, reaching Faradje by August 10.  It is in this month and again in March and April that <taxonName>Micropus apus</taxonName> is most abundant in the Uelle district.  Yet it is a difficult bird to collect, usually flying high and at great speed.</p>
				<p>Toward October most of them disappear from the Uelle, and the latest was noted on November 22.  They reappear late in February or in early March, and then remain in evidence for about a month.  The trip back to Europe seems to take but little time.</p>
				<p>At Avakubi in the forest belt they also arrive in August&mdash;once as early as the 8th&mdash;and become more and more common up into October. Even there, however, only a few remain through the period of northern winter.  The majority pass on to the region south of the forest, and then in early February return again on their way north.  At Lukolela in 1930 they were first noted on August 30, a flock of fifty catching winged termites in the rain.  Others were seen frequently until December 28, and then no more until February 26, 1931.  <taxonName>Micropus apus</taxonName> reaches the Orange River and Natal, but the belief that it also goes to Madagascar
<pb n="457" id="t000120-p00463c.tif"/> is erroneous.  Two specimens banded at different localities in Germany have been recovered in the Kasai district.</p>
				<p>Even at seasons when they are present in the Congo they seem to appear very irregularly.  None may have been noticed for weeks, then there comes a day when hundreds are seen in the sky and some come shooting down to within ten yards of the ground.  This generally happens in the morning, or on cloudy or even rainy days, when winged ants or termites are swarming.  Out of seventeen stomachs examined, twelve contained winged ants, five, winged termites, and in only one case were other small insects, probably beetles, mixed with the ants.</p>
				<p>Shortly after sundown parties of European swifts are often seen passing over as if on the way to roost.  Usually there are no cliffs where they could sleep, and I suppose they must go into hollow trees.  Petit<note n="1">1899, Mem. Soc. Zool. France, XII, p. 74.</note> told of seeing a flock of three hundred swifts, which he called &quot;caffer,&quot; pass the night in a colony of weavers' nests.  Nothing of this sort has ever come to my attention.</p>

				<p>Comparison of these six adults from the Uelle with specimens taken in June in China shows a close agreement in size and coloration.

The shaft-stripes on throat are usually very distinct.

				<p>The resemblance between <taxonName idx_name="Micropus barbatus roehli">M. b. roehli</taxonName> and <taxonName idx_name="Micropus apus apus">M. a. apus</taxonName> is considerable, but in adults the feathers of the lower breast and flanks have more conspicuous light tips in <taxonName idx_name="Micropus barbatus roehli">roehli</taxonName>, and the fork of the tail is deeper in <taxonName idx_name="Micropus apus apus">apus</taxonName>: 27&ndash;33.5 mm., as compared with 20&ndash;27 mm. in <taxonName idx_name="Micropus barbatus roehli">roehli</taxonName>.</p>
				<p>Dr. van Someren<note n="3">1922, Nov.

Although Meinertzhagen<note n="4">1922, Ibis, pp. 39, 40.</note> denied this distinction, I convinced myself of its reality in 1926 by collecting breeding males of both species in Kenya Colony, near Lake Naivasha and at Maji Mazuri.  <taxon><taxonName>Micropus nakuruensis</taxonName> (van Someren)</taxon> is probably a synonym of <taxonName idx_name="Micropus apus shelleyi">shelleyi</taxonName>.</p>

				<p>In the original description of <taxonName idx_name="Micropus barbatus roehli">roehli</taxonName>, the wing-length was given as only 160 mm.; but it really is 165 mm., as I found on examining the type.

				<p><taxonName idx_name="Micropus barbatus roehli">Micropus b. roehli</taxonName> inhabits eastern Africa, from Usambara and the highlands of Kenya Colony to the Kivu district of the Belgian Congo. In the Congo Museum there are two mounted specimens from the &quot;Ruzizi-Kivu&quot; district.  My own examples were taken as follows: two non-breeding females were shot from a party of about ten, feeding over a ridge at 5000 feet, some three miles east of Rutshuru, on April 2, 1927. On July 17 of the same year a male and a female were secured at 6900 feet in the mountains west of the Ruzizi Valley.  The male showed slight enlargement of the testes, and was carrying a ball of insects in his mouth, as though to feed young.  The female&apos;s ovary was small.  These two birds, with a half-dozen others of their kind and a number of swallows, were attracted by a grass fire.  The species may be expected to nest in crevices of rocky cliffs, and is certainly resident.  It would seem to nest in the Kivu district toward June.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;From Eritrea and Abyssinia south to southern Rhodesia, Angola, and Southwest Africa; also Darfur and Sierra Leone.  Largely restricted to high mountains and their vicinity, nesting only where there are high cliffs.  <taxonName idx_name="Micropus &aelig;quatorialis &aelig;quatorialis">M. &aelig;. &aelig;quatorialis</taxonName> extends from northeastern Africa to Ruwenzori and Lake Tanganyika, and south of the Congo basin it extends westward to Tala Mugongo and Benguella; but within our limits it seems to occur only in the mountains along the eastern border.  <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Micropus &aelig;quatorialis reichenowi">M. &aelig;. reichenowi</taxonName> (Neumann)</taxon> of Donye Erok, Tanganyika Territory, and perhaps Usambara appears to be a valid race, more brownish gray beneath.

				<p>The races do not differ appreciably in wing-length, and seven males from Ruwenzori have this measurement 204&ndash;210 mm., a female 204 mm.</p>
				<p>On Ruwenzori <taxonName idx_name="Micropus &aelig;quatorialis &aelig;quatorialis">M. &aelig;. &aelig;quatorialis</taxonName> is very abundant and no doubt breeds in cliffs around 8000 or 10,000 feet.  At Kalongi, a group of huts at 7000 feet overlooking the gorge of the Butahu, they would sometimes gather in flocks of a hundred or two, feeding mainly on bees closely allied to the hive-bee, but their appearances were irregular.  Days might pass without their being seen, and they usually showed themselves only during the morning, from 8 to 10 o'clock.  Sometimes they were accompanied by a few larger white-bellied swifts.</p>
				<p>Doubtless they descend every day into the adjacent lowlands to feed, for we saw them also in the upper Semliki Valley and along the northern shore of Lake Edward.  Despite the very large size of <taxonName idx_name="Micropus &aelig;quatorialis &aelig;quatorialis">&aelig;quatorialis</taxonName>, it is not always readily distinguished at a distance from <taxonName>Micropus apus</taxonName>.  So when parties of large black swifts were seen flying over the new post of Beni, some 35 miles from the base of Ruwenzori, late in the afternoon, I did not feel entirely sure of their" identity until a specimen was shot.  It proved to be <taxonName idx_name="Micropus &aelig;quatorialis &aelig;quatorialis">&aelig;quatorialis</taxonName> and showed that the feeding range extends to the forest country west of Beni.  Other swifts which appeared to be <taxonName idx_name="Micropus &aelig;quatorialis &aelig;quatorialis">&aelig;quatorialis</taxonName> were also seen on the grassy highlands northwest of Lake Edward, at about 7800 feet.  But none were noticed&mdash;or at least" identified&mdash;among the Kivu Volcanoes, although they must occur in the mountains northwest of Lake Tanganyika.  Carruthers&apos;s specimen was taken between Uvira and Baraka.</p>
				<p>The seven examples taken on the western slope of Ruwenzori in December were all fully adult but non-breeding.  A male secured at Beni on February 22 had gonads much enlarged, and salivary glands prominent; so by then breeding must have commenced.</p>

The Eurasian race, <taxonName idx_name="Micropus melba melba">M. m. melba</taxonName>, migrates to tropical Africa, and there are other forms breeding in the mountains of northeast, east, and southern Africa, as well as on Madagascar.  Eight or nine races are recognizable, of which at least four are resident in the Ethiopian Region.<note n="1">See Meinertzhagen, 1922, Ibis, p. 34; 1925, Ibis, pp. 318, 319.  Also Hartert, 1928, Nov.

				<p>The characters of <taxonName idx_name="Micropus melba archeri">archeri</taxonName> are its paler color as compared with the typical race, and shorter wings, 195&ndash;207 mm.  The coloration of <taxonName idx_name="Micropus melba africanus">africanus</taxonName> is deeper than that of <taxonName idx_name="Micropus melba melba">melba</taxonName>, the brown on chest-band and flanks more extensive, and its wings shorter, 197&ndash;210 mm.  Still deeper in color is <taxonName idx_name="Micropus melba maximus">maximus</taxonName>, with very long wings, 228&ndash;233 mm.  The Mt. Kenya form, <taxonName idx_name="Micropus melba striatus">striatus</taxonName>, is known from only a single female, with underparts more streaked than <taxonName idx_name="Micropus melba maximus">maximus</taxonName>, and wing 220 mm.  The supposed Kalahari race, <taxonName idx_name="Micropus melba marjori&aelig;">marjori&aelig;</taxonName>, was described simply as paler than <taxonName idx_name="Micropus melba africanus">africanus</taxonName>.</p>
				<p>All our specimens from Faradje are <taxonName idx_name="Micropus melba melba">M. m. melba</taxonName>, with wings of males 218&ndash;225 mm., of females 212&ndash;224.  This subspecies migrates south in Africa to the Uelle and Lado districts and Ruwenzori.  The British Museum has single examples from Kajo Kaji in March and from Ruwenzori in February.  Our observations during three seasons show that the Palaearctic race comes to the Uelle regularly and in numbers.  I first noted these large swifts near Dungu on January 23, 1911.  The following year, on the morning of January 14, a few were flying over just northwest of Faradje.  Later came a flock of 50 or 60, and in the afternoon a grass-fire attracted hundreds.  Most of them kept so high as to be far out of gunshot, but a few came lower, and two were shot.  More were noticed in March, sometimes flocking with <taxonName>Micropus apus</taxonName>.  The last mixed flock was seen on March 18, and a single <taxonName idx_name="Micropus melba melba">melba</taxonName> on March 24, 1912. During the dry season of 1912-1913 the Alpine swift was first observed on December 22, and again on the 26th, when a flock of two or three hundred came down to feed over the Dungu River at Faradje.  For
<pb n="462" id="t000120-p00468c.tif"/> about half an hour they sped back and forth without a single call-note, dipping occasionally in the water.</p>
				<p>The stomachs of the birds feeding above a grass-fire contained numbers of small grasshoppers, some small hemiptera, a few small beetles, and a leaf-hopper.  In the case of eleven birds taken over the Dungu River, the stomach contents were almost exclusively of hemiptera, especially one bright green species which must have been present in enormous numbers.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;The Ruwenzori Range, where it nests and roosts at altitudes above 10,000 feet, and possibly the Kivu Volcanoes.  In the Mubuku Valley, East Ruwenzori, the British Museum Expedition found it about cliffs at 13,000 to 14,000 feet and coming down to others at 10,000 feet.  In April or May Woosnam saw swifts over the plains near Lake Edward which he took to be <taxonName idx_name="Micropus melba maximus">maximus</taxonName>.</p>
				<p>On the western slopes the Ruwenzori alpine swift is as common as on
<pb n="463" id="t000120-p00469c.tif"/> the eastern.  Though seen only in relatively small numbers at Kalongi (7000 feet), in company with <taxonName idx_name="Micropus &aelig;quatorialis &aelig;quatorialis">&aelig;quatorialis</taxonName>, it was abundant near the mountains rising to 14,900 feet just west of Mt. Stanley.  Here almost every morning they would assemble in great numbers, a hundred or more, skimming and circling in the sun above the cliffs, and giving occasionally a series of rather weak chirps or peeps, repeated less rapidly than the call of the European black swift.</p>
				<p>These assemblies began about 7 A.M., and lasted for an hour or two, the birds then disappearing for the rest of the day.  Only occasionally would one be seen in the late afternoon.  While disporting themselves in the morning sun the swifts did not feed, and perhaps there were few or no insects to be had at these cold heights.</p>
				<p>We have plenty of evidence that this alpine swift spends most of its days, and gets most of its food, at lower levels.  Besides seeing them at 7000 feet near the Butahu gorge, we noted them in small numbers over a grassy ridge at 5000 feet near the south end of the range, on the upper Semliki River at 3000 feet, and at Kasindi Landing on Lake Edward.</p>
				<p>On the open grassy highlands northwest of Lake Edward, at about 7800 feet, it was a fairly frequent experience to see alpine swifts, singly or up to ten together, shooting by at terrific speed.  Toward nine in the morning they were traveling westward, at three in the afternoon toward the northeast.  After a few failures with the shotgun one was tempted to estimate their velocity at about a hundred miles per hour.</p>
				<p>Sage saw one near the summit of Mt. Mapanda, west of Lake Edward; and a little after 8 o'clock on the morning of March 29, a party of a dozen appeared at the north end of the Kasali Mountains, in the Rutshuru Valley, where they were catching winged termites.  This was at 3700 feet, and at least 80 miles from their home on Ruwenzori.  But it would be only an hour&apos;s journey for them.  I conclude these birds came from Ruwenzori, for none were seen during our stay on the Kivu Volcanoes.</p>
				<p>Of the four specimens secured between December and March, none was in full condition to breed, so I do not feel certain as to the season at which they nest.  No doubt they roost in fissures in the cliffs at all seasons, but I could not locate these retreats.</p>

				<p>There is certainly geographic variation in the length of wing and general coloration among the African palm-swifts, but the exact limits of the subspecies are difficult to outline.  Four races are all I would recognize on the continent at present.</p>
				<p><taxon><taxonName idx_name="Cypsiurus parvus parvus">C. p. parvus</taxonName> (Lichtenstein)</taxon><note n="1">1823, `Verz. Doubl.,' p. 58 (Nubia).</note> is a light-colored, long-winged race, extending over the dry region from Senegal to the Blue Nile.  Its wing measures about 126&ndash;140 mm.</p>
				<p><taxon><taxonName idx_name="Cypsiurus parvus brachypterus">C. p. brachypterus</taxonName> (Reichenow)</taxon>, of the western coastal region from Sierra Leone to northern Angola, also on Fernando Po, and inland from the Cameroon and Gaboon to the Upper Uelle, the whole Upper Congo forest, and the Kasai district, is dark-colored, with shorter wings, 120&ndash; 135 mm.</p>
				<p><taxon><taxonName idx_name="Cypsiurus parvus myochrous">C. p. myochrous</taxonName> (Reichenow)</taxon>, ranging from Lake Albert to Lake Tanganyika, the Zambesi, and perhaps southern Angola and northern Damaraland, is again lighter gray, but not so pale on the throat as <taxonName idx_name="Cypsiurus parvus parvus">parvus</taxonName>, with wings 124&ndash;143 mm.  The throat in some specimens shows dusky streaking or mottling which resembles that of the following race.</p>
				<pb n="465" id="t000120-p00471c.tif"/>
				<p><taxon><taxonName idx_name="Cypsiurus parvus l&aelig;mostigma">C. p. l&aelig;mostigma</taxonName> (Reichenow)</taxon>,<note n="1">1905, `V&ouml;g. Afr.,' III, p. 828 (Bardera, S. Somaliland).</note> described from southern Somaliland, was supposed to differ from <taxonName idx_name="Cypsiurus parvus myochrous">myochrous</taxonName> in the broad dusky streaking of its throat.  This character is often, though not always, well marked in specimens from the coast of East Africa.  Their wings measure about 125&ndash;135 mm., and their upperparts may be slightly darker than in <taxonName idx_name="Cypsiurus parvus myochrous">myochrous</taxonName>.  The validity of the race is still doubtful.</p>
				<p><taxon><taxonName idx_name="Cypsiurus parvus gracilis">C. p. gracilis</taxonName> (Sharpe)</taxon>, living on Madagascar and the Cormoros, is a very dark form with heavily spotted throat.</p>
				<p>In the northern Congo the average difference in wing-length between the sexes does not exceed 3 mm., males generally larger.  Occasional specimens of all the races show exceptionally short wings, but this may often be due to retention of juvenal primaries.  Within Congo territory the wing-length of <taxonName idx_name="Cypsiurus parvus brachypterus">brachypterus</taxonName> is about 120&ndash;125 mm. in the region from Banana to Stanley Pool, 122&ndash;132 between Lukolela and Luluabourg, and 127&ndash;135 between Medje and Faradje.  I have been tempted to separate Uelle birds as <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Cypsiurus parvus uamensis">C. p. uamensis</taxonName> (Reichenow)</taxon>, but I cannot draw a line to divide such a race from <taxonName idx_name="Cypsiurus parvus brachypterus">brachypterus</taxonName>.  Lower Congo specimens seem a little paler and grayer than those of the forested Upper Congo, and there may be an unnamed pale grayish race from the coast of Angola to Swakopmund.</p>
				<p>This palm-swift occurs both in savannas and in clearings of the Congo forest, especially where there are oil-palms.  Its local abundance often depends very much upon the presence of palms, even in the Upper Uelle, although there it has learned to use the thatch of houses as a substitute nesting site.  In many forested regions of the Congo it is a rare bird, and we noticed practically none during a long trip down the Aruwimi River.  Bates saw palm-swifts for the first time at Bitye in the Cameroon forest in 1910.</p>
				<p>Nowhere did we see greater numbers of these birds than over Banana Point, in June, 1909, circling about the cocoanut palms, where doubtless they breed abundantly.  At Kinshasa and many places in the Lower Congo (Matadi, Boma, Malela) they are also common, and to make use of the fan palms (<taxonName>Hyph&aelig;ne guineensis</taxonName>) as nesting sites.  At Lukolela they use the <taxonName>Borassus</taxonName> palms.</p>
				<p>At Stanleyville we found them common about the station, for it was well planted with oil-palms.  They go chasing one another about in twos and threes, with shrill, protracted notes recalling those of <taxonName>Micropus apus</taxonName> about its nesting grounds, though weaker.  At Avakubi, too, they were of fair abundance; but it is along the northern border of the forest,
<pb n="466" id="t000120-p00472c.tif"/> so rich in oil-palms, that one finds them most numerous.  On the northeastern frontier of the Congo they are again local, and most apt to be noted where there are <taxonName>Borassus</taxonName> palms.  They may be seen at all times of day, but are most active, or perhaps they fly lower, in the early morning and late afternoon.  In flight the tail is generally so tightly closed that the deep fork cannot be seen at all, though it is opened at times in making turns or quick descents.</p>
				<p>In the Kasai district palm-swifts are likewise numerous, and Father Callewaert collected well-grown nestlings in June and July, the early part of the dry season.  Nesting probably continues during a much longer period of the year, for at Kisantu Dr. Schouteden obtained nestlings in November, and at Lukolela I found them in March, September, and December.</p>
				<p>In the Ituri and Uelle, likewise, the palm-swifts seem to nest throughout the year, for in the forest area we found nests in January and September, while in the savannas to the northward they were likewise breeding in January, February, May, June, and October.  Their nests are not difficult to locate, for the old birds swoop upward and alight, from time to time, among the palm-leaves.  Closer scrutiny usually reveals them clinging vertically against the nest, wing-tips and tail pointing downward. Nests are tiny hammock-shaped structures of feathers glued against the palm-leaves, in places where they offer good shelter from rain.  They are so small&mdash;about 9 cm. high and 5.5 cm. broad&mdash;that the incubating bird could not sit in them, even if it knew how; and the normal set of two elongated white eggs, glued firmly with saliva in an upright position, fills them completely.<note n="1">The gluing of the eggs in the nest seems first to have been described by A. E. Brehm (1853 J. f. O., Extraheft, p. 95).  It has since been confirmed by many observers.  See especially Schuster, 1912, O. Mb., pp. 121&ndash;126; Loveridge, 1917, Mem. Proc. Manchester Lit. Phil. Soc., LXI, No. 7, pp. 1&ndash;3; 1919, Journ. E. Afr. Ug. N. H. Soc., No. 14, pp. 412&ndash;414; Butler, 1918, Sudan Notes, Khartoum, I, pp. 161, 162; 1919, Ibis, p. 654; Paget-Wilkes and Sladen, 1930, Ibis, p. 453; Belcher, 1930, `Birds of Nyasaland,' p. 155; Moreau, 1932, Ibis, p. 657.</note> Two eggs of a set from Faradje both measure 18.4 &times; 12.3 mm.  Bannerman gave measurements of 18.4 &times; 12.1.</p>
				<p>Several nests may be built close together, and the feathers employed must be caught in the air.  In the northeastern Congo they were most often those of <taxonName>Vinago calva</taxonName>, but feathers of domestic fowls, of weavers, and other birds, as well as an occasional bit of plant pappus, were also noted. The under side of a <taxonName>Borassus</taxonName> leaf is an" ideal location.</p>
				<p>Where palms are scarce these swifts will sometimes nest in the grass thatch of houses.  One such nest near Faradje held eggs with well-formed embryos, yet the birds came to it only in early morning and late
<pb n="467" id="t000120-p00473c.tif"/> afternoon, as though the sun kept it properly warmed during most of the day.  The incubating bird captured at night was a female.  In another case, at Niangara, a male was found on the eggs at night.</p>
				<p>Young nestlings are perfectly naked, with dusky skin and closed eyes.  From the minute of hatching they instinctively grasp the nest so firmly that they cannot fall out.  They do not sit crosswise in the nest, but squat with heads up and breasts against the back of the nest. There is no true natal down, but as the first plumage grows out there are pale gray downy feathers along the sides of the crown, scapulars, and rump, which seem to develop faster than the contour plumage. The juvenal plumage has every feather narrowly tipped or margined with rufous.</p>
				<p>Our palm-swifts' stomachs contained small insects, sometimes winged ants in numbers, less often small beetles.  The mouth of one female, evidently feeding young, was filled with small flies, winged ants, tiny beetles, and other minute insects.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;Uganda, interior of Kenya Colony, and Tanganyika Territory, southward to the lower Zambesi, and westward apparently to Benguella and Damaraland.  In Congo territory it occurs along the eastern border, from Lake Albert and the Semliki to the western shore of Lake Tanganyika; but records are wanting from the Kivu highlands, as well as those of the Upper Katanga.</p>
				<p>Professor Reichenow reported two specimens from the lower Semliki Valley, but added that in body-color they inclined toward the darker <taxonName idx_name="Cypsiurus parvus brachypterus">brachypterus</taxonName>, though the wings measured 130 and 132 mm.  I have also taken a female at Kasenyi on Lake Albert, with wing 133, which is slightly lighter than <taxonName idx_name="Cypsiurus parvus brachypterus">brachypterus</taxonName>, and a male and female on the upper Semliki River, both with wings 131 mm.  A male secured by Pilette in the Semliki Valley has wing 140.  A male from the northeast shore of Lake Tanganyika has dusky mottling on the throat, wing 136 mm.  So also
<pb n="468" id="t000120-p00474c.tif"/> has one from Moba, on the southwest shore, with wing 137.  In Marungu, Rockefeller and Murphy collected a series of ten, at altitudes between 3800 and 4550 feet.  Of these, five adult males have wings 124&ndash; 143 mm., four adult females 126&ndash;132.  Their throats are rather uniform gray, but in a few cases show signs of dusky mottling.  Somewhere near the Lualaba River <taxonName idx_name="Cypsiurus parvus myochrous">myochrous</taxonName> must intergrade with <taxonName idx_name="Cypsiurus parvus brachypterus">brachypterus</taxonName>.</p>
				<p>The habits of <taxonName idx_name="Cypsiurus parvus myochrous">myochrous</taxonName> are exactly like those of <taxonName idx_name="Cypsiurus parvus brachypterus">brachypterus</taxonName>.  Its eggs may be slightly larger.  From Nyasaland, Belcher gave dimensions as 19 &times; 12.5 mm.</p>

				<p>SPECIMENS.&mdash;Boma, &male;, Jan. 21; 2 &female;, Jan. 11, 25.  Leopoldville, 2 &male;, July 2, 3.</p>
				<p>ADULTS.&mdash;Iris rather dark brown, naked skin behind eye light blue-gray, that in front black; bill black above, but with a gray patch on culmen, lower mandible yellowish gray, becoming black at base; feet coral red, with black claws.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;Cape Province and Natal north to Somaliland, Eritrea, the Sudan, Cameroon, and perhaps Nigeria. Wanting in the desert country of southwestern Africa, and in all the central part of the Upper Congo forest; but ascends mountains of eastern Africa to 8000 feet where not heavily forested.</p>
				<p>About thirteen races are recognized, for there is marked geographic variation in general color, barring, whiteness of ear-coverts, blackness of throat, and in eye-color.  Five of the forms are known to occur in the Belgian Congo, and two others near its borders.  For a complete review see Friedmann (1930).</p>
				<p><taxonName idx_name="Colius striatus nigricollis">C. s. nigricollis</taxonName>, ranging from Northern Nigeria through the Cameroon to the Lower Congo and Kwango district, has black face and throat, chest barred, and no gray patch on ear-region.  <taxonName idx_name="Colius striatus leucophthalmus">C. s. leucophthalmus</taxonName> of the Uelle and eastern Ituri is very like <taxonName idx_name="Colius striatus nigricollis">nigricollis</taxonName>, but the crest is noticeably paler, the hind-neck more barred, and the iris whitish instead of dark brown.  <taxonName idx_name="Colius striatus erlangeri">C. s. erlangeri</taxonName>, southwestern Abyssinia to the Lado district, has a silvery gray patch on ear-region, crest gray-brown, darker than in <taxonName idx_name="Colius striatus leucophthalmus">leucophthalmus</taxonName>, throat dark gray, not black, and barred with light gray.  <taxonName idx_name="Colius striatus jebelensis">C. s. jebelensis</taxonName> of the Lake Albert region and Uganda has a similar gray patch over the ear, but its throat is more blackish than that of <taxonName idx_name="Colius striatus erlangeri">erlangeri</taxonName>, upperparts deeper in color, and upper back less barred.  <taxonName idx_name="Colius striatus kiwuensis">C. s. kiwuensis</taxonName> of the Kivu district is similar to <taxonName idx_name="Colius striatus jebelensis">jebelensis</taxonName>, but slightly darker.  The chest in both is barred with blackish brown.  <taxonName idx_name="Colius striatus congicus">C. s. congicus</taxonName> ranging from Lake Tanganyika to the Katanga and Kasai districts, has the throat blacker than in <taxonName idx_name="Colius striatus kiwuensis">kiwuensis</taxonName>, not spotted with gray, the gray of the ear-region a little darker, and its chest is practically unbarred.  Specimens from Marungu show some approach to <taxonName idx_name="Colius striatus berlepschi">C. s. berlepschi</taxonName> of Nyasaland and southwestern Tanganyika Territory, which is slightly paler than <taxonName idx_name="Colius striatus congicus">congicus</taxonName>, with grayer throat and chest somewhat more distinctly barred.</p>
				<p><taxonName idx_name="Colius striatus nigricollis">C. s. nigricollis</taxonName> is found in savannas and in clearings near the border of the forest, in the Cameroon, Gaboon, and Lower and Middle Congo. The Congo Museum has a specimen from Baaba in the Kwango district, but I have never seen any coly along the Congo River above Kwamouth. Shelley was mistaken in recording a specimen as taken at Yambuya. Jameson&apos;s only bird having been secured in the Cataract district.  It
<pb n="470" id="t000120-p00476c.tif"/> would seem that <taxonName idx_name="Colius striatus nigricollis">nigricollis</taxonName> must reach the vicinity of Bangui, for an example from Fort Sibut in the Philadelphia Academy was labeled as having the iris dark brown.</p>
				<p>We found this the common coly in the Mayombe, at Boma, Matadi, Leopoldville, and Kwamouth, going about in flocks of five to ten, keeping generally in rather dense vegetation.  In behavior and voice they are exactly like the allied race of the Uelle.  A nest found at Kwamouth on December 19 was of open cup-shape, built like that of <taxonName idx_name="Colius striatus leucophthalmus">C. s. leucophthalmus</taxonName> in a bush nine feet from the ground.  The three eggs were colored like those of <taxonName idx_name="Colius striatus leucophthalmus">leucophthalmus</taxonName>.  A female collected at Boma on January 11 was found on dissection to be laying, and yet she was found amid a party of six.  A male at Leopoldville in early July was found to be in breeding condition, and the season of reproduction must be very long and irregular.</p>
				<p>Of three stomachs examined, two contained fruit, noted in one case as a species of <taxonName>Ficus</taxonName>.  One of these also held a piece of leaf, and the third stomach contained only leaves.</p>

				<p>SPECIMENS.&mdash;Bafwabaka, 4 &male;, Jan. 10, Dec. 31.  Medje, 5 &male;, Jan. 15, 17, 18, Sept. 14; 3 &female;, Jan. 18, 22, June 7; 3 &male; juv., Mar. 10, 15, July 25; 3 &female; juv., Mar. 10, 15, Aug. 18.  Niangara, 2 &male;, Nov. 16, Dec. 3; 4 &female;, Nov. 7, 11, 16, 28.  Nzoro,

				<p>ADULTS.&mdash;Iris grayish white, naked skin in front of eye, as well as the rim of eyelids, black, skin behind eye light bluish gray.  Maxilla black, with a blue-gray patch above, and two smaller spots of the same color at the sides near base.  Mandible light yellowish gray, changing to bluish posteriorly, and black at the base.  Feet coral red, with black claws.</p>
				<p>NESTLINGS.&mdash;Iris dark grayish brown; maxilla green with dusky tip, mandible black; eyelids green, skin behind eye gray; feet red with claws black.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;Savanna region of the northeastern Congo Basin from the edge of the forest near the Nepoko River north to Meridi and Kojali in the southern Bahr-el-Ghazal.  Probably extends westward at least to Yakoma, and certainly southeast to the Lendu Plateau, Irumu, and the new post of Beni.  Close to the margin of the forest it may continue a little farther southward, but it certainly does not occur on the shores of Lake Kivu.  That this white-eyed race interbreeds with <taxonName idx_name="Colius striatus jebelensis">jebelensis</taxonName> and <taxonName idx_name="Colius striatus kiwuensis">kiwuensis</taxonName> is proved by the occurrence of birds with intermediate eye-color at Bogoro and near Beni.</p>
				<p>In the northern Ituri district the white-eyed coly does not penetrate far into the clearings near the edge of the forest.  We found it about a native village four hours' march south of Medje, and at Bafwabaka, but never at Ngayu, Gamangui, or along the lower Ituri River.  Out in the savannas of the Uelle it is an abundant and characteristic bird, living in companies of three to six, climbing about in bushes and low trees, where it assumes positions that are most grotesque.  Sometimes it hangs down from a horizontal twig, less often sitting upright on it, and occasionally walks right up a small perpendicular branch, propping itself with its long tail.  The foot of a dead coly seems to have all four toes pointing more or less forward, but a live bird on the ground spreads its toes in an X.  When clinging to a branch it holds its second and third toes forward, sometimes even the fourth, but the first is little used.</p>
				<p>The flight of these birds is characteristically direct and rapid, but not protracted, spells of energetic wing-beats alternating with periods of gliding on open wings.  The usual call-notes are hoarse and not loud, but a weak whistle may be heard occasionally.  Small flocks roost together in some dense bush or on the vine-clad trunks of oil-palms, whence they go whirring away explosively when disturbed.<note n="1">In captivity they sleep in a dense cluster, according to Pechu&euml;l-Loesche, 1888, `Loango Expedition,' III, pt. 1, p. 266.</note>
				</p>
				<p>Many young were brought to us by natives, and I examined seven nests.  These are never built in large trees, but in second-growth scrub, or in bushes and low trees in dry savanna, and occasionally even in a
<pb n="472" id="t000120-p00478c.tif"/> bunch of green plantains in a garden.  The nest is remarkably like that of many Passeres, bowl-shaped with a rather bulky foundation, and composed of dry plant-stems, thin vines, grass, leaves, soft fibres from bark, and even bits of moss.  It may measure 6  1/2 or 7 inches across the top, and is generally placed in a fork from 5 to 12 feet above the ground, well hidden by foliage.  The set is always of two eggs, in color a lack-luster buffy whitish, covered all over as if soiled by faint specks of greenish brown.  Eight eggs measure 19.3&ndash;22 mm. &times; 16.6&ndash;18.</p>
				<p>In the vicinity of Medje breeding takes place throughout the year, adults with enlarged gonads or nesting birds having been taken in January, March, July, August, September, and December.  In the savannas of the Uelle it certainly goes on from June to November, but only adults in non-breeding condition were taken in February and March.  At that season their food supply would be at low ebb.</p>
				<p>Both sexes incubate, and sociable habits persist even during nesting. I have frightened a bird from its nest and seen it join at once a party of four or five others.  Birds with enlarged gonads are commonly found in such groups.</p>
				<p>The food consists largely of fruits both wild and cultivated, guavas and papayas being especially favored.  Of sixteen stomachs examined, eleven contained fruit, including that of <taxonName>Musanga Smithii</taxonName> and a small red pepper.  In one case there were also small green leaves.  Five stomachs contained nothing but red earth.  These were of colies captured in a small cave in the bank of a wooded ravine near Mt. Gaima.  Almost every day the birds came there, and often they were caught by natives. In one day I have known thirty colies and a dove to be taken, yet the next day I saw a dozen or more colies waiting outside.  The earth was a laterite containing dark fragments that held some manganese.  In addition it was found to have  4/10 of one per cent of soluble inorganic salts, chiefly chloride, some sulphate, but no nitrate.  The birds seem to eat it for its salt content.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;Upper Bahr-el-Jebel, Uganda, shores of Lake Albert, and savanna of the lower Semliki.  This race is not easily distinguished from <taxonName idx_name="Colius striatus kiwuensis">kiwuensis</taxonName>, though it averages a little lighter in color.

				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;From the lower slopes of Ruwenzori and the vicinity of Beni south through the Kivu district and Ruanda to the northern end of Lake Tanganyika.  It ascends the escarpment southwest of Lake Edward, where I have seen it at Luofu.  On Ruwenzori and other high mountains it occurs up to 7000 feet where woods are not too dense.</p>
				<p>The iris of <taxonName idx_name="Colius striatus kiwuensis">kiwuensis</taxonName> is parti-colored as in <taxonName idx_name="Colius striatus jebelensis">jebelensis</taxonName>.  West of the upper Semliki Valley one finds some individuals which have the iris whitish with an inverted crescent of yellow above the pupil.  Their plumage approaches that of <taxonName idx_name="Colius striatus leucophthalmus">leucophthalmus</taxonName>.  Others, even on the western base of Ruwenzori, have the plumage of <taxonName idx_name="Colius striatus kiwuensis">kiwuensis</taxonName>, and the iris with some whitish below the pupil.</p>
				<p>I have compared the type of <taxonName idx_name="Colius striatus kiwuensis">kiwuensis</taxonName> with three other skins from Kisenyi which Reichenow" identified as <taxonName idx_name="Colius striatus nigricollis">nigricollis</taxonName>, and can see no racial difference.  It must be admitted that <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Colius striatus kikuyuensis">C. s. kikuyuensis</taxonName> van Someren</taxon> of the East African highlands differs little if at all from <taxonName idx_name="Colius striatus kiwuensis">C. s. kiwuensis</taxonName>, and the latter name is the older.</p>
				<p>In choice of haunts, voice, and nesting, this subspecies is exactly similar to <taxonName idx_name="Colius striatus leucophthalmus">leucophthalmus</taxonName>.  It lives in lowland savannas, especially where there are many trees and bushes, but also ascends the slopes of mountains, profiting by clearings made by natives.  On the western slope of Ruwenzori it was common about Kalongi, but did not range higher because of the dense mountain forest.  It occurs also about the bases of the Kivu Volcanoes, and ranges south to the northern end of Lake Tanganyika.  The Congo Museum has two skins from Uvira with normal barring on the chest.</p>
				<p>Birds ready to breed were taken in the region near Ruwenzori in October, November, and March; and it seems likely that they nest there throughout the year.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;Western shore of Lake Tanganyika to Basongo in the Kasai district, and south to the Upper Katanga, possibly northern Rhodesia.  It is readily distinguished from <taxonName idx_name="Colius striatus kiwuensis">kiwuensis</taxonName> by the lack of gray spotting on the throat and dark barring on the chest.  In the Congo Museum there are two skins of <taxonName idx_name="Colius striatus congicus">congicus</taxonName> from as far north as Baraka, and a large series from Moba, Kiambi, Kansenia, and the Kando River near Tenke.  Two single specimens come from Kapolowe and the upper Luapula River.</p>
				<p>Specimens from the Kasai district have wings 92&ndash;97 mm. long, whereas those of the Katanga, Marungu, and the shore of Lake Tanganyika have them 95&ndash;105 mm.  Some examples from Marungu show a tendency toward <taxonName idx_name="Colius striatus berlepschi">berlepschi</taxonName> in color, but their throats are usually blacker.</p>
				<p>According to Neave (1910) the iris of <taxonName idx_name="Colius striatus congicus">congicus</taxonName> in the Katanga is yellow on the upper half, brown on the lower.  This has been confirmed by Rockefeller and Murphy for Marungu specimens; but Father Callewaert at Luluabourg noted the eye-color as green or greenish.</p>
				<p>In the Upper Katanga Neave found this coly not uncommon, generally seen in flocks, and inhabiting the bush on the banks of streams.  In the Kasai district it is certainly common, and young colies just out of the nest were taken at Luluabourg in May and October.  There is a surprising lack of any record for a coly between Basongo and Kwamouth. Intergrades between <taxonName idx_name="Colius striatus congicus">congicus</taxonName> and <taxonName idx_name="Colius striatus nigricollis">nigricollis</taxonName> are as yet unknown.</p>

				<p>This name has often been applied to specimens from the southeastern Congo, but I find specimens from the northern end of Lake Nyasa lighter-colored than <taxonName idx_name="Colius striatus congicus">congicus</taxonName>, with throats less black, chests more barred.  Marungu specimens are somewhat intermediate, and if <taxonName idx_name="Colius striatus berlepschi">berlepschi</taxonName> occurs at all in Congo territory I should expect it near Moliro.  Its range is from Nyasaland north to Ujiji on the eastern shore of Lake Tanganyika and to Uhehe.

				<p><taxon><taxonName>Colius castanotus</taxonName> J. AND E. VERREAUX, 1855, Rev. Zool., Paris, p. 351</taxon> (type from &quot;Gaboon,&quot; see Sharpe, `Cat. Birds Brit. Mus.,' XVII, p. 343).  CHAPIN, 1929, J. f. O., Festschrift E. Hartert, p. 181, map.  BANNERMAN, 1933, `Birds Trop. W. Afr.,' III, p. 145.</p>
				<p>Closely allied to <taxonName>Colius striatus</taxonName>, but with a large patch of deep chestnut covering the whole rump.  Chin blackish, and forehead black with gray-feather-tips; no barring on fore-neck; wing 95&ndash;106 mm.  Iris, according to label by Dr. W. J. Ansorge, chrome-yellow above and below pupil, greenish yellow at sides.</p>
				<p>From Mossamedes and Benguella it extends to Duque de Bragan&ccedil;a in northern Angola and, it has been said, to the Gaboon.  Thus it might seem as though its range overlapped with that of <taxonName idx_name="Colius striatus nigricollis">C. striatus nigricollis</taxonName>. Verreaux&apos;s type was supposedly from the Gaboon, where Marche and Compi&egrave;gne were also reported to have obtained a specimen.  But none has been collected there recently, and we have sought in vain for the species in the Lower Congo.  There is of course a possibility of its reaching the southern Kwango district.</p>
				<p>Verreaux&apos;s well-known inaccuracy as to localities raises a suspicion that his type came really from Angola, and that the range of <taxonName idx_name="Colius castanotus">castanotus</taxonName> may be complementary to those of the races of <taxonName idx_name="Colius striatus">striatus</taxonName>.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;Senegal to Lake Chad, Eritrea, Somaliland, grasslands of the eastern Congo border, and East Africa south to the region north of Nyasa.</p>
				<p><taxon><taxonName idx_name="Urocolius macrourus macrourus">U. m. macrourus</taxonName> (Linn&aelig;us)</taxon>, of very pale color, ranges from Senegal east to the Egyptian Sudan, northern Abyssinia, Somaliland, and probably to the coast of Kenya Colony.  <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Urocolius macrourus pulcher">U. m. pulcher</taxonName> (Neumann)</taxon>, slightly deeper in color, occupies the region from southern Abyssinia to interior Kenya Colony, the Kavirondo district, and Tanganyika Territory.  <taxonName idx_name="Urocolius macrourus griseogularis">U. m. griseogularis</taxonName>, the darkest race of all, with grayish throat, is found along the eastern edge of the Congo, near Lake Albert and Lake Edward. It appears to range northward along the Bahr-el-Jebel to Lado; and was said by van Someren to reach Lake Kivu and the north end of Tanganyika. While the species is rather numerous in the lower Rutshuru Plain, I cannot find any published record from south of the post of Rutshuru; but there are two specimens in the Rothschild Collection obtained by Grauer near Lake Urigi and the Kagera River.  Iris rather dull dark red (perhaps a little browner in females), orbit and gape-region dark crimson; base of maxilla rose-red, hard sheath of maxilla black, blue-gray at posterior margin, mandible black; feet purplish red, claws black.</p>
				<p>The blue-naped coly requires a relatively dry open country, and thus its distribution in the Congo is far more restricted than that of the brown colies.  The two species are found together on the plains in the Albertine Rift.  The blue-naped species is a far more wary bird, going in parties of four to ten, and usually flying long distances when disturbed. Their flight is swift and direct, the narrowness of their tails very striking, suggesting comparison with the stick of a rocket.  The wings beat rapidly, or are held rigid during spells of gliding flight.  Often they sit very upright in the tops of thorn-trees, or &quot;hitch&quot; their way along the branches, resembling the brown colies in their unusual attitudes.</p>
				<p>The only notes I have heard are single long whistles, with considerable carrying power, given both from the perch and on the wing.  The
<pb n="478" id="t000120-p00484c.tif"/> pitch of the whistle is sometimes rather high, less often lower.  Small fruits, with the addition of bits of green leaf, form their food.</p>
				<p>The nest is cup-shaped, and built of twigs, grass, bark-fibre, and rootlets, at a height of ten or fifteen feet in a bush.  Eggs two to three, whitish with rufous or brown blotches or streaks, dimensions about 20.3 &times; 14.5 mm.</p>
				<p>The breeding season appears to be much shorter than in the case of <taxonName>Colius striatus</taxonName>.  From seeing non-breeding adults accompanied by young in September, I believe that the breeding season near Kasenyi, Lake Albert, must come about May.</p>

				<p>SPECIMEN.&mdash;Madrapili, between Faradje and Aba, &male;, Oct. 4.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;Cape Colony to Eritrea and Liberia, including the West African forests.  As I pointed out in 1923, the typical, long-tailed form of this species is a bird of heavy woods and gallery-forests in southern and eastern Africa, extending northward to Eritrea and Darfur.  Females have the chest brownish.  Along the East Coast from southern Somaliland to eastern Usambara lives a small race, <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Apaloderma narina littoralis">A. n. littoralis</taxonName> van Someren</taxon>,<note n="1">1931, B. B. O. C., LI, pp. 80, 81 (Sokoke Forest).</note> with the underparts of females paler.  In the forests of Uganda, as well as the equatorial belt of the Congo and of the Cameroon, the species is represented by the short-tailed <taxonName idx_name="Apaloderma narina brachyurum">A. n. brachyurum</taxonName>, the female of which has a grayish chest.  A fourth race, <taxonName idx_name="Apaloderma narina constantia">A. n. constantia</taxonName>, also short-tailed, but the male with more extensive white vermiculation on the wings, inhabits the forest areas from Togoland to Liberia.  The tail-length in <taxonName idx_name="Apaloderma narina narina">A. n. narina</taxonName> varies from 165 to 200 mm., in <taxonName idx_name="Apaloderma narina brachyurum">brachyurum</taxonName> from 145 to 170.  <taxonName>Apaloderma &aelig;quatoriale</taxonName> is a distinct species, as will be explained later.</p>
				<p>In Congo territory <taxonName idx_name="Apaloderma narina narina">A. n. narina</taxonName> occurs only in the extreme northeast,
<pb n="480" id="t000120-p00486c.tif"/> the east, and the south.  I found only a single example in the Uelle, between Faradje and Aba.  In the eastern highlands it occurs in wooded places above 5000 feet, and I have seen specimens from the Mokoto Lakes, Kamatembe, Burunga near Mt. Mikeno, the vicinity of Kisenyi and Katana on Lake Kivu, Gabiro in Ruanda, and the highlands near Baraka.  There is also a male in the Congo Museum from the Dogodo River between Baraka and Kasongo.  This is the only race occurring in the Katanga, where Neave obtained it on the Bunkeya River and De Riemaecker on the Lufira.  B&ouml;hm saw it at Mpala and on the Luvua River, and farther to the west de Witte collected three specimens at Dilolo.</p>
				<p>In the Kasai district <taxonName idx_name="Apaloderma narina narina">narina</taxonName> is found in the south and <taxonName idx_name="Apaloderma narina brachyurum">brachyurum</taxonName> in the north.  They meet near Luluabourg, where Father Callewaert collected two males of <taxonName idx_name="Apaloderma narina narina">narina</taxonName> (tails 168 and 170 mm.) and two of <taxonName idx_name="Apaloderma narina brachyurum">brachyurum</taxonName> (tails 148 and 150 mm.).  At Katabwa he secured a female of <taxonName idx_name="Apaloderma narina narina">narina</taxonName> with light brown chest (tail 182 mm.).  One would scarcely expect the long-tailed race in the Lower Congo, and although a male collected by Dr. Schouteden in the Upper Mayombe has the tail 168 mm.  I doubt if it should be referred to typical <taxonName idx_name="Apaloderma narina narina">narina</taxonName>.  A similar intermediate has been reported from the Amboim province of Angola,<note n="1">Sick, 1934, O. Mb., p. 168.</note> but <taxonName idx_name="Apaloderma narina narina">A. n. narina</taxonName> is known to occur at Duque de Bragan&ccedil;a in northern Angola.</p>
				<p>The bare skin of the face in this race is rather similar in color to that of <taxonName idx_name="Apaloderma narina brachyurum">brachyurum</taxonName>.  The anterior patch, near the base of the bill, is greenish yellow with narrow blue margin, while the posterior one is bluish in front, shading to green behind.</p>
				<p>In the Upper Uelle we found the Narina trogon anything but common. Our only specimen was taken in a patch of tall forest, where it was feeding among the boughs at middle height.  It was in non-breeding condition (October), and had eaten three small caterpillars, some beetles, a bug, and other insects.</p>
				<p>In the Katanga this trogon is never seen in the savanna woods, but only in the thicker growth of trees in ravines or along streams.  At various places in the Kivu it occurs in patches of forest around 5000 and 6000 feet, but probably never ascends above 7000 feet.  Its call is a low coo, repeated in leisurely fashion, and not doubled as is that of <taxonName idx_name="Apaloderma narina brachyurum">A. n. brachyurum</taxonName>.  The nesting habits are the same as those of <taxonName idx_name="Apaloderma narina brachyurum">brachyurum</taxonName>, two to four glossy white eggs being laid in a hole in a dead tree.  Chubb<note n="2">1914, Ann. Durban Mus., I, p. 62.</note> gave measurements of South African eggs as 26.4&ndash;27.9 mm. &times; 22.8&ndash;23.3</p>

				<p>ADULT MALE.&mdash;Iris red-brown, naked patch above eye pale bluish green, the two below eye light green, with a little light blue along their upper borders.  Skin of throat (hidden by feathers in life) light blue, that of hind-neck pale pinkish.  Basal portion of bill deep cadmium-yellow, distal portion light greenish gray.  Feet brownish pink.</p>
				<p>ADULT FEMALE.&mdash;Iris dark brown or red-brown, naked spot above eye light blue, those below light green, or light blue washed with green.  Bill greenish yellow basally, pale greenish gray beyond.  Feet brownish pink.</p>
				<p>IMMATURE MALE.&mdash;Iris brown, naked patches below eye light green, each with a little light blue anteriorly.  Bill light yellowish green at base, outer part of maxilla gray, becoming blackish above, tip of mandible light greenish gray.  Feet grayish flesh-color.</p>
				<p>IMMATURE FEMALE.&mdash;Similar to young male, but cheek patches noted as dull grayish green.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;From the coast of southern Cameroon and Gaboon eastward through the rain forest of the Congo basin to the Uelle district, Semliki Valley, and the heavier forests of Uganda as far as Chagwe.  In the Congo its northern limit is not far beyond the edge of the unbroken forest.  I believe this race inhabits the Mayombe forest, though the
<pb n="482" id="t000120-p00488c.tif"/> single example I have seen from there has a rather long tail.  It certainly occurs at Lemfu near Kisantu, where Father Goossens collected two with short tails.  In the Kasai it ranges southward in gallery forests to Luluabourg, and the Congo Museum has also a male collected by Pauwels at Baraka on Lake Tanganyika.  In the Kivu district this race may occur where there is suitable forest below 5000 feet, as on the eastern edge of the Rutshuru Valley.</p>
				<p>One never sees trogons in the clearings of the Congo forest; and in the woods these are not conspicuous birds, despite their rosy breasts. They perch in the taller undergrowth and the lower boughs of the great trees, and are not especially tame, so that at first one is apt to get only fleeting glimpses as they fly off silently amid the foliage.  Knowledge of their voice gives a better introduction; and following up the rather dove-like cooing, one may find the male sitting with drooping tail, repeating his double &quot;cu-coo,&quot; starting faintly, but increasing in strength, and stopping after about four seconds.  Each &quot;cu-coo&quot; is accompanied by a slight wag of the tail.  I have also heard the male of this trogon utter a low triple note, almost a grunting sound, not at all apt to attract attention.  Females seem to be silent.</p>
				<p>Dissections indicate that the breeding season extends throughout the year, for in the Ituri we took females with ovary enlarged in January, April, and September.  Males seemed never to have greatly enlarged gonads, but some slight development was noticed in January, February, June, July, August, and September, this again pointing to a very prolonged season of reproduction.</p>
				<p>Our two nestlings (Medje, March) were brought to us with an adult female by a native, who said he had taken them from a cavity in a tree. Their eyes were still closed, and they assumed a most unusual posture, sitting very upright, with the bill pointing vertically or even inclined slightly backward.  They even seemed to like to rest the back against some perpendicular surface, doubtless from being used to the wall of the nesting hole.  The eggs are undoubtedly pure white and glossy.</p>
				<p>Many of the trogons of the New World eat fruit, but those of Africa do not touch it.  Caterpillars, in the present instance, form the greater part of the food, for we found them in sixteen of the twenty stomachs examined.  Six caterpillars were the largest number noted in a single stomach, and seldom if ever were they hairy ones.  Orthoptera were next in order of abundance, usually rather large green jumping forms, and they were present in ten cases, though seldom more than one at a time.  Two large mantises were also noted.  Some insect eggs in one
<pb n="483" id="t000120-p00489c.tif"/> stomach came probably from the bodies of orthoptera which had been swallowed.  Among the additional insects eaten may be mentioned four hemiptera, two beetles, and a large moth (swallowed without removing the wings).</p>

				<p>SPECIMENS.&mdash;Banalia, &male;, Sept. 26.  Avakubi, 8 &male;, Feb. 26, Mar. 29, July 14, 20, Aug. 13, 15, 28; 3 &female;, Apr. 11, July 23, Aug. 22; &male; im., Oct. 2.  Ngayu, 2 &male;, Dec. 13.  Medje, &male; juv., Aug. 31.</p>
				<p>ADULT MALE.&mdash;Iris red-brown, naked patches above and below eye deep chrome- or light cadmium-yellow, like the base of bill.  Distal portion of bill pale grayish green or greenish gray.  Naked skin on fore-neck light blue.  Feet pale flesh-color, grayish on upper surface of toes.</p>
				<p>ADULT FEMALE.&mdash;Iris red-brown, cheek-patches lemon-yellow, base of bill slightly deeper yellow, tip of bill light green, shading to dusky on culmen.  Feet flesh-color, claws gray.</p>
				<p>IMMATURE MALE.&mdash;Iris dark brown; maxilla dusky, but its base greenish yellow like the naked cheek-spots, mandible light yellowish green, with light gray tip.  Feet pinkish.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;Rain forest of Lower Guinea, from Victoria, near the base of Mt. Cameroon, southward to Spanish Guinea and perhaps the Gaboon, eastward to Poko in the southern Uelle district and Moera in the vicinity of Beni.  It must extend southward across the whole Upper Congo forest, for we now have one adult male from Luluabourg in the Kasai district.</p>
				<p>My measurements of 28 males of <taxonName>Apaloderma &aelig;quatoriale</taxonName> from the Congo, Cameroon, and Spanish Guinea show that their wings vary from 115 to 126 mm. in length, their tails from 136&ndash;161.  Seven females from the Ituri and the Cameroon have wings 110&ndash;125 mm., tails 140&ndash;156.</p>
				<p>My attention was first called to the distinctness of this small species by its voice, a series of longer, more mournful notes than those of <taxonName idx_name="Apaloderma narina">A. narina</taxonName>, each of a single syllable that I first wrote &quot;kwaw!&quot;  In later
<pb n="484" id="t000120-p00490c.tif"/> years it has sounded to me more resonant, less like a coo, and from a distance rather like &quot;owng.&quot;  Usually this is repeated slowly about seven times, and all but the first note are nearly disyllabic.  At short range it might be written: &quot;Ow, oodle, oodle, oodle,&hellip;.&quot;  The bird, always a male, keeps its bill tightly closed, and at each note the throat swells markedly, exposing the blue skin, while the tail is wagged downward to the vertical.</p>
				<p>To a great extent the haunts of the two species are the same, but <taxonName idx_name="Apaloderma narina">narina</taxonName> was to be found at times in areas of tall second-growth, whereas <taxonName idx_name="Apaloderma &aelig;quatoriale">&aelig;quatoriale</taxonName> seemed never to leave the virgin forest.  The latter species was far shyer, too, for it was often difficult to come within sight of the birds; and then they had to be shot at 35 or 40 yards, even in thick forest.  They usually perch on lianas or branches without leaves, at five or six yards above the ground.  In the forest north of the Ituri River, above Avakubi, I have heard as many as five in one morning. During the short dry period of December and January both species of trogons were found to be rather silent, and <taxonName idx_name="Apaloderma &aelig;quatoriale">&aelig;quatoriale</taxonName> was most noisy near Avakubi in late July, August, and September.  Once in April, I shot a female, whose mate at a little distance was giving his usual loud reiterated call, while she answered in a much lower tone.  The rainy season would seem to be the time of reproduction; and this is rather long in the Ituri, for we took breeding females in April and August, a nestling in August, and an immature bird in October.  Two non-breeding males were taken in December, and one in March and one in July as well, while a non-breeding female was also secured in July. Like males of <taxonName idx_name="Apaloderma narina brachyurum">Apaloderma n. brachyurum</taxonName>, those of the present species never showed any great enlargement of the testes, though several of them seem to have been breeding birds.</p>
				<p>In feeding habits this trogon is similar to the race of <taxonName idx_name="Apaloderma narina">A. narina</taxonName> with which it lives, for of twelve stomachs ten were noted as containing caterpillars or their remains, and in one case the caterpillars were certainly hairy.  Orthoptera were present in seven cases, usually large green jumping forms, though it was rare to find more than one in a stomach. The flat eggs of some orthopter were also noted once, but I think they were swallowed inside the body of a female insect.  No fruit is eaten by this trogon, either; and the only other things found were one chrysalis and a snail (doubtless a <taxonName>Helixarion</taxonName>) with soft flat shell.  The excrement of both species of <taxonName>Apaloderma</taxonName> has a much more foul odor than is usual among small birds.</p>

Specimens from the eastern Congo are intermediate in length of wing, 115&ndash;125 mm., but probably best placed with <taxonName idx_name="Heterotrogon vittatus camerunensis">camerunensis</taxonName>.

				<p><taxonName>Heterotrogon</taxonName> differs from the genus <taxonName>Apaloderma</taxonName> principally by its smaller, more depressed bill.  The serration of the border of the maxilla is rather variable in <taxonName>Apaloderma</taxonName>, wanting in the young.  Traces of serration, on the other hand, are sometimes recognizable in <taxonName>Heterotrogon</taxonName>. The latter bird also has small naked areas on the cheeks, homologous with the larger spaces in <taxonName>Apaloderma</taxonName>.</p>
				<p>The adult male has the iris red-brown, above eye a small bare spot of yellow or gray, two patches beneath eye rich orange; bill chrome-yellow; feet dull pinkish yellow, with larger scales olive-gray, claws brownish. In the female the patches below the eye are not quite so bright; the bill dull lemon-yellow, culmen and distal half of maxilla brownish black.</p>
				<p>The bar-tailed trogon is confined to mountain forest and known so far from only a few localities above 5000 feet in the eastern Congo.  It is to be expected on the western slope of Ruwenzori; and I once thought I heard it there, at 7000 feet, but never saw one.  I have collected specimens, however, in the forest near Djugu on the Lendu Plateau, 5400 feet, and at Mulu, northwest of Lake Edward, 8000 feet.  Later I

					</figure>  heard its voice at 5300 feet in the mountains east of the Rutshuru Plain. Never could I find it on the Kivu Volcanoes.  The casual remark of Woosnam (1910) that he saw this trogon in the Ituri forest was certainly incorrect, as was also the statement by L&ouml;nnberg<note n="1">1911, K. Svenska Vet. Akad. Handl., XLVII, No. 5, p. 69.</note> that it is widespread in West African forests.</p>
				<p>The usual call of <taxonName>Heterotrogon</taxonName> is a rather loud &quot;how,&quot; slightly prolonged and slowly repeated, very different from that of either species of <taxonName>Apaloderma</taxonName>.  It is given by the male, who also seems to be the author of a lower, hoarser, &quot;what-what-what&mdash;&quot; uttered more rapidly.  Follow these notes and you may find the trogon perched high in some great forest tree, or on a low bough among the tree-ferns, with sometimes a female nearby.  In general behavior there is a great similarity to <taxonName>Apaloderma</taxonName>,

				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;Forests of Lower Guinea, from the Cameroon coast and Angola east to Uganda and the Mau Plateau.  In Upper Guinea the genus is represented by <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Trachyl&aelig;mus goffini">T. goffini</taxonName> (Schlegel)</taxon>, which is regarded by Grote (1927)&mdash;probably with good reason&mdash;as conspecific with <taxonName idx_name="Trachyl&aelig;mus purpuratus purpuratus">purpuratus</taxonName>.</p>
				<p><taxonName idx_name="Trachyl&aelig;mus purpuratus purpuratus">T. p. purpuratus</taxonName> ranges from the base of Mt. Cameroon to the Gaboon coast and the lowland forests of Angola, south to the Amboim Province; also eastward in the Upper Congo forest to the vicinity of Yambuya on the Aruwimi River.  The eastern race, <taxonName idx_name="Trachyl&aelig;mus purpuratus elgonensis">T. p. elgonensis</taxonName>, is not conspicuously different, but exhibits less of the whitish appearance of the throat and fore-neck produced by the loose barbs of the feathers. The area of intergradation is very broad, and while the Congo Museum has undoubted examples of <taxonName idx_name="Trachyl&aelig;mus purpuratus purpuratus">purpuratus</taxonName> from the Lower Congo and Kunungu near Bolobo, those from Luluabourg in the Kasai and Inkongo on the Sankuru River are certainly intermediate in color.  In a series from Buta the margins of throat-feathers are a little more whitish than in birds from Mt. Elgon.</p>
				<p>This barbet is less a bird of virgin forest than of second growth and tangled woods near old clearings.  It keeps fairly well up in the trees, never showing itself near houses, and would generally escape notice were it not for its voice.  It repeats a note like &quot;cook&quot; or &quot;coop&quot; about every two seconds, sometimes for a long period.  Two birds may seem to answer each other, and the syllables are louder and terminate more abruptly than the soft coos of <taxonName>Trichol&aelig;ma hirsutum</taxonName>.</p>
				<p>In the Cameroon, Bates took an old bird with a single nestling from a hole in a tree, and caught a female in a nesting hole which contained four eggs.  These were pure white, somewhat glossy, and measured 28.5&ndash;29.5 mm. &times; 18&ndash;20.5.  Most of the barbets in the forested Cameroon, he found, preferred the dry seasons for nesting.  Reichenow found a nest with young on the Cameroon River on January, and at Lukolela a nestling with tail not yet half grown was collected on January 22.</p>

				<p>ADULTS.&mdash;Iris dark red (deep carmine); bill and naked face light cadmium-yellow (bill sometimes a little more greenish); feet dark greenish or brownish gray with soft skin on outer side of metatarsus greener, and soles yellowish.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;From the Mau Plateau in Kenya Colony and Mt. Elgon westward through the forest areas of Uganda to the eastern Congo.  Birds from the Ituri and southern Uelle belong to this subspecies, which may be expected southward to the Manyema.  <taxonName idx_name="Trachyl&aelig;mus purpuratus elgonensis">Trachyl&aelig;mus p. elgonensis</taxonName> extends but little into the savanna district of the Uelle.  At Avakubi it is a rather common, but retiring bird about plantations and former village sites, provided there are large trees left standing; and it cuts out its nests in dead trees.  Along the Aruwimi it was heard commonly, and from Pawa north to Rungu it was still numerous, to judge from the frequency with which we heard its voice.  It gives the same slowly repeated &quot;cook&mdash;cook&mdash;cook&mdash;cook&mdash;&quot; as <taxonName idx_name="Trachyl&aelig;mus purpuratus purpuratus">T. p. purpuratus</taxonName>.</p>
				<p>In the eastern Ituri, in 1926-1927, this barbet was noted as rather common in the forest between Irumu and Beni.  It is strictly limited to the forest, however, and does not ascend the mountains very far.  On the west slope of Ruwenzori, near the Luami River, I heard its call at 5750 feet; in the Kivu Dr. Schouteden and G. F. de Witte collected specimens a little above 6000 feet.</p>
				<p>The majority of our adult examples were definitely in non-breeding
<pb n="490" id="t000120-p00496c.tif"/> condition.  Slight enlargement of the gonads was noted only in three birds, in April and August; so that what evidence there is, including newly fledged young, points to April (early part of the rains) as the breeding season in the northern Ituri.</p>
				<p>Of eleven stomachs, ten contained fruit, often of a bright yellow color, but including also palm-nut pulp and berries.  One bird had eaten only two snails, and another snail was found with the fruit.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;From Natal north to the Pangani River in East Africa, Lake Tanganyika, and Angola.  <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Trachyphonus vaillantii vaillantii">T. v. vaillantii</taxonName> Ranzani</taxon> inhabits southern Africa, north to about the Zambesi.  From Lake Ngami Ogilvie-Grant described a subspecies <taxonName idx_name="Trachyphonus vaillantii nobilis">nobilis</taxonName> from a single specimen with very stout bill, but it appears not to be valid, and typical <taxonName idx_name="Trachyphonus vaillantii vaillantii">vaillantii</taxonName> may reach southern Angola.  <taxonName idx_name="Trachyphonus vaillantii suahelicus">T. v. suahelicus</taxonName> ranges from the Zambesi River north to the eastern coast near the Pangani River.  It has a rather small bill, and is richly varied with red on face and breast. The bases of the frontal feathers are blackish, their tips red, and the intervening space yellowish.  Grote would restrict suahelicus to the eastern coastlands, where the wing-length is said to be only 93&ndash;97 mm.; and he has described <taxonName idx_name="Trachyphonus vaillantii suschkini">T. v. suschkini</taxonName><note n="1">Grote, 1929, O. Mb., p. 76 (Tabora, Unyamwezi).</note> as a larger inland race, with wings 100&ndash; 104 mm., extending from Unyanyembe to Lake Tanganyika and northern Angola.  I find that skins from the southeastern Congo have wings varying from 95 to 107 mm.  There does seem to be an average difference in wing-length, but that is all.  So I shall retain the name <taxonName idx_name="Trachyphonus vaillantii suschkini">suahelicus</taxonName> for the birds occupying the southeastern Congo and ranging westward to northern Angola.</p>
				<p>The Congo Museum has skins from Tembwe on Lake Tanganyika, Kabalo on the Lualaba, Kiambi on the Luvua, Lukafu, Elisabethville, Nieuwdorp, Kanzenze, and Funda Biabo.  Rockefeller and Murphy collected three specimens in southern Marungu, at altitudes between 3600 and 5650 feet.  At Kiambi it is evidently very numerous, and Neave mentioned this barbet as fairly common in the Upper Katanga, more often heard than seen.  It is doubtless a bird of savanna woods, and its voice was compared by B&ouml;hm and by Ayres to the sound of an alarm clock.  The notes are repeated every few minutes, and sometimes become almost a trill.</p>
				<p>Levaillant&apos;s barbet occasionally joins mixed bird-parties and its diet includes insects as well as fruit.  Its nest is in a hole in a tree, the eggs numbering three or four.  They are smooth and white, measuring, in the South African race, 29.2&ndash;30.2 mm. &times; 20.6&ndash;20.8.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;Highlands encircling the Congo basin; Mt. Cameroon, the highlands of northern Cameroon, Ruwenzori, the mountains west of Lake Edward, the Kivu Volcanoes, and the plateau region of Benguella.  Though confined to woods, it is unknown in areas below 5000 feet, at least in the Congo.</p>
				<p><taxon><taxonName idx_name="Viridibucco coryph&aelig;us coryph&aelig;us">V. c. coryph&aelig;us</taxonName> Reichenow</taxon> is restricted to the highlands of Cameroon, and has bright chrome-yellow on crown, middle of back, rump, and wings.  <taxonName idx_name="Viridibucco coryph&aelig;us jacksoni">V. c. jacksoni</taxonName><note n="1">For this race G. M. Mathews, 1934, B. B. O. C., LV, p. 34, proposed the substitute name <taxonName idx_name="Viridibucco coryph&aelig;us kildamari&aelig;">kildamari&aelig;</taxonName>, but it need not be used if the genus <taxonName>Viridibucco</taxonName> is considered valid.</note> of the highlands of the eastern Congo differs in having the yellow of upperparts a little more greenish.  <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Viridibucco coryph&aelig;us angolensis">V. c. angolensis</taxonName> Boulton</taxon><note n="2">1931, Ann. Carnegie Mus., XXI, p. 46 (Mombolo, Benguella).</note> is known only from the plateau of Benguella.</p>
				<p>For many years this species was known only from Cameroon.  Then the Mecklenburg Expedition obtained a single specimen in the Kivu. I found it rather common on Ruwenzori, and the race <taxonName idx_name="Viridibucco coryph&aelig;us jacksoni">jacksoni</taxonName> was described by Sclater from a single specimen collected by Jackson many years before.  Meanwhile Boulton had discovered the race he later named <taxonName idx_name="Viridibucco coryph&aelig;us angolensis">angolensis</taxonName>.</p>
				<p>On Ruwenzori I shot my first specimen in July, 1926, at 7800 feet on Mt. Musandama, near the northeastern end of the range.  In December of the same year, I found it fairly common on the western slope of Ruwenzori, at 7000&ndash;8000 feet, near the Butahu River.  Nowhere, however, was it so numerous as in the mountains northwest of Lake Edward, at an elevation of about 7000 feet.  Here I have heard as many as six in a day&apos;s march.</p>
				<p>Among the Kivu Volcanoes the species is not rare.  Two were collected on the northwest slope of Mikeno at 7900 feet, and others were heard in woods north of Kibati, 6700 feet, and on the southeast flank of Mt. Niragongo at 6800 feet.  It seems certain to occur in the mountains northwest of Lake Tanganyika, and possibly some form of this species lives in small patches of forest at high levels in the Upper Katanga.</p>
				<p>Even less apt to be seen than the species of <taxonName>Pogoniulus</taxonName>, this diminutive tinker-bird will usually escape observation if one does not purposely listen for its call.  Instead of repeating a single &quot;tok,&quot; it gives a short series of such sounds, three to seven in number, but run together rapidly. This sharp &quot;ik-k-k-k-k,&quot; of almost frog-like character, is repeated
<pb n="493" id="t000120-p00499c.tif"/> slowly a number of times, but never for such protracted periods as the voice of <taxonName>Pogoniulus leucolaima</taxonName>.</p>
				<p>The birds we saw calling were all males, females are found only by good luck.  They frequent scrubby woods especially, and keep from 8 to 30 feet above the ground.  In eight stomachs examined there was always yellow or orange pulp from fruit, and in five cases bits of small insects were noted as well.  Some of the latter seemed to be small beetles.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;Sierra Leone to northern Angola, Uganda, and the interior of Kenya Colony.  Five subspecies are recognized. <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Pogoniulus scolopaceus scolopaceus">P. s. scolopaceus</taxonName> (Bonaparte)</taxon> ranges from Sierra Leone to Calabar, and <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Pogoniulus scolopaceus stellatus">P. s. stellatus</taxonName> (Jardine and Fraser)</taxon> is peculiar to Fernando Po. <taxonName idx_name="Pogoniulus scolopaceus flavisquamatus">P. s. flavisquamatus</taxonName> extends from the Cameroon to the Lower Congo and eastward to the Uelle, the Semliki Valley, east Rutshuru Valley, the Manyema, and Kasai.  The race <taxonName idx_name="Pogoniulus scolopaceus consobrinus">consobrinus</taxonName> of Riechenow, described from Kibondo, between the Lualaba River and Tanganyika, seems not to be separable.  I cannot find any constant difference in color between specimens from the Ituri and Uelle and those of Luluabourg in the Kasai. The northeastern specimens have wings 54&ndash;59 mm., those of the Kasai 57&ndash;60 mm.  <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Pogoniulus scolopaceus aloysii">P. s. aloysii</taxonName> Salvadori</taxon>,<note n="1">1906, Boll. Mus. Zool. Anat. Torino, XXI, No. 542, p. 2 (Entebbe).</note> with slightly whiter fore-neck and flanks more marked with black, ranges from Uganda to Lake Naivasha. Northern Angola has <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Pogoniulus scolopaceus angolensis">P. s. angolensis</taxonName> Bannerman</taxon>, with feathers of upperparts all tipped with brighter greenish yellow than in any other race, underparts more uniform than in <taxonName idx_name="Pogoniulus scolopaceus flavisquamatus">flavisquamatus</taxonName>.  Three specimens collected by Dr. Schouteden at Kidada agree with <taxonName idx_name="Pogoniulus scolopaceus angolensis">angolensis</taxonName>, and two obtained by Dr. Schwetz near the Kwango River are probably of that race.</p>
				<p>In the Congo this small barbet is resident in the lowland forest area and in the heavier gallery forests.  It frequents old clearings with many trees standing, and the borders of forest, but is heard even in its more remote parts.  When we first noticed its voice, Lang felt sure it must be that of a quail (<taxonName>Coturnix</taxonName>), and so close indeed is the resemblance that a few years later I immediately recognized the note of the quail in France. The barbet&apos;s notes differ however, in starting with a single syllable, &quot;cok!&quot; or &quot;quip!&quot;  This is repeated slowly, then becomes doubled to &quot;cokok,&quot; tripled, and gradually, as the repetition continues, it consists of four or five rapid syllables, and finishes as though the bird were out of breath.  It is the middle part that most reminds one of the European quail.  After a spell of calling, the bird generally remains quiet for a
<pb n="495" id="t000120-p00501c.tif"/> little time.  L. Petit has likewise compared these notes with those of the quail.<note n="1">1899, Mem. Soc. Zool. France, XII, p. 64.</note>
				</p>
				<p>Like all of the African barbets, <taxonName idx_name="Pogoniulus scolopaceus">P. scolopaceus</taxonName> usually perches, and is only occasionally noticed pecking at a tree in woodpecker fashion, probably when nest-building.  Near Penge, April 23, I found a nest, the entrance to which was a round hole so small that it was astonishing to see how easily the female bird popped in and out of it.  This was in a dry tree stub, only about twelve feet above the ground, in a clearing.  There were three nestlings, with only the tips of the feather-sheaths showing through the skin.  No special nesting material had been used.  Nests are not always so low down, for at Avakubi I saw a pair going into a hole high up in a tree.  Possibly four eggs are sometimes laid; they are white, and three secured by Bates<note n="2">1911, Ibis, p. 506.</note> in the Cameroon measured 17&ndash;18.5 mm. &times; 13.5&ndash;14.</p>
				<p>Among the examples collected in the Ituri there were birds in breeding condition in February, March, April, and again in August.  I should not be surprised if some were nesting at almost any season.</p>
				<p>From seven stomachs examined, the diet appears to be a combination of fruit and insects, for small seeds were present in three stomachs, small fruits in four, and insects in four.  One of the last-named was an earwig, which I saw captured on the wing.</p>

				<p>This subspecies differs only slightly from <taxonName idx_name="Pogoniulus scolopaceus flavisquamatus">flavisquamatus</taxonName>, and is found in Uganda and western Kenya Colony.

				<p>ADULTS.&mdash;Iris dark brown, bill black, feet greenish black.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;From Senegal to Abyssinia and south to Bechuanaland and the Transvaal, avoiding the whole of the West African forest.  Seven races were recognized by Claude Grant (1915) and by Sclater (1924).</p>
				<p><taxon><taxonName idx_name="Pogoniulus chrysoconus chrysoconus">Pogoniulus c. chrysoconus</taxonName> (Temminck)</taxon> ranges from Senegal to the Benue River, while the closely allied <taxonName idx_name="Pogoniulus chrysoconus centralis">P. c. centralis</taxonName> extends from the savannas of the Ubangi and Uelle to Uganda, and south along the eastern Congo border to the plains about Lake Edward.  In this race the crown-patch is bright chrome-yellow, the under surface bright lemon-yellow, the middle wing-coverts with pale yellowish borders, and inner secondaries only narrowly margined with whitish.  Wings 57&ndash;61 mm. <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Pogoniulus chrysoconus schubotzi">P. c. schubotzi</taxonName> (Reichenow)</taxon>, more broadly streaked with whitish on back, is found from Asben to the Bahr-el-Ghazal; <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Pogoniulus chrysoconus zedlitzi">P. c. zedlitzi</taxonName> (Neumann)</taxon> near the White and Blue Niles; <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Pogoniulus chrysoconus xanthostictus">P. c. xanthostictus</taxonName> (Blundell and Lovat)</taxon> in southern and central Abyssinia.</p>
				<p>The race occupying the southeastern Congo is <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Pogoniulus chrysoconus rhodesi&aelig;">P. c. rhodesi&aelig;</taxonName> Grant</taxon>. Its crown-patch is deeper yellow than in <taxonName idx_name="Pogoniulus chrysoconus centralis">centralis</taxonName>, middle and lesser wing-coverts washed with golden yellow, inner secondaries with broad
<pb n="497" id="t000120-p00503c.tif"/> white external margins.  The lower surface is paler yellow, and the breast usually has a conspicuous wash of ochre.  Wings 55&ndash;64 mm. <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Pogoniulus chrysoconus extoni">P. c. extoni</taxonName> (Layard)</taxon> is the southernmost form, from southern Angola and southeastern Nyasaland to the Transvaal.<note n="1">The recent revision by Macdonald, 1938, Ibis, pp. 346&ndash;348, seems to me somewhat hasty.</note>
				</p>
				<p><taxonName idx_name="Pogoniulus chrysoconus centralis">P. c. centralis</taxonName> was heard and observed at Aba, Piagga (near Faradje) Nzoro, and about Dungu.  It was not a very common bird, nor very regularly distributed, but inhabited dry bushy savanna land, where the trees were fairly dense and high, seeming fond also of the neighborhood of rocky hills.  My attention was attracted by its voice, which differs from that of <taxonName idx_name="Pogoniulus leucolaima">P. leucolaima</taxonName> and <taxonName idx_name="Pogoniulus subsulphureus">subsulphureus</taxonName> in that there is no periodic pause after every four notes or more.  The syllables do not increase in number, as with <taxonName idx_name="Pogoniulus scolopaceus">P. scolopaceus</taxonName>; but the same individual may have two or three styles of call.  A common one is a double &quot;cok-ok, cok-ok, cok-ok, cok-ok&mdash;&quot;; and I have heard the same male bird change after a short silence to a simpler &quot;cok, cok, cok, cok, cok,&quot; not unlike that of the forest-haunting <taxonName idx_name="Pogoniulus erythronotos">erythronotos</taxonName>.  The third style for <taxonName idx_name="Pogoniulus chrysoconus">chrysoconus</taxonName> is a more rolling &quot;cok-k-k-k, cok-k-k-k, cok-k-k-k&mdash;.&quot;</p>
				<p>The pair taken on June 30 were ready to breed, and the other male was also in similar condition in early March.  The stomach contents in two cases were of fruit, in the third, beetle-remains.</p>
				<p>In 1926 and 1927, I heard the yellow-fronted tinker-bird frequently at Kasenyi on Lake Albert, and about the southern base of Ruwenzori, near Kasindi.  In these regions, too, it lives among the trees growing in a rather dry savanna, and does not ascend the higher mountains.  Its notes seem to me almost indistinguishable from those of <taxonName>Pogoniulus pusillus</taxonName>, its red-fronted counterpart in the more easterly part of Africa, from Eritrea to eastern Cape Province.</p>
				<p>The nest of the yellow-fronted species is a hole excavated in a rotten limb of a tree, with round entrance about 22 mm. wide.  Lynes<note n="2">1925, Ibis, p. 350.</note> reported a nest of <taxonName idx_name="Pogoniulus chrysoconus schubotzi">P. c. schubotzi</taxonName> in Darfur on April 14, at a height of 15 feet in a large wild fig-tree.  It contained two naked young.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;Northern Nyasaland, Northeast Rhodesia, and Angola, north to Lake Tanganyika, the Ruzizi Valley, and the Kasai district.  Not yet reported from the Lower Congo.  This race is very closely allied to <taxonName idx_name="Pogoniulus chrysoconus extoni">P. c. extoni</taxonName>.</p>
				<p>The ochreous-yellow wash on the breast is especially strong in five specimens collected at Luluabourg in the Kasai district by Father Callewaert. These have wings 55&ndash;60 mm.  Ten specimens from Marungu, Upper Katanga, Kinda, and Dilolo are distinctly duller on the breast, with wings 59&ndash;62 mm.  Kasai specimens are probably deserving of racial recognition.<note n="1">Admiral Lynes, 1938, Rev. Z. A. XXXI, p. 71, is of this same opinion.</note>
				</p>
				<p>According to Neave, this small barbet is not uncommon in the savanna woods of the Upper Katanga, occurring singly or in small family parties, one of them sometimes accompanying a bird party.  I have seen the species in the Ruzizi Valley, and have little doubt that the subspecies <taxonName idx_name="Pogoniulus chrysoconus rhodesi&aelig;">rhodesi&aelig;</taxonName> is the one living there, since specimens from the northwest side of Lake Tanganyika have been" identified by Ogilvie-Grant and by Sassi as <taxonName idx_name="Pogoniulus chrysoconus extoni">extoni</taxonName>.</p>
				<p>A set of two white eggs of <taxonName idx_name="Pogoniulus chrysoconus rhodesi&aelig;">rhodesi&aelig;</taxonName> was found by Lynes<note n="2">1934, Ibis, p. 38.</note> in October near Serenje, Northern Rhodesia; average measurements 18.7 &times; 12.3 mm.</p>

				<p>ADULT MALE.&mdash;Iris very dark brown; bill black; feet dusky with a slight tinge of bluish, soles yellowish.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;Western forest region from Senegal to the Upper Uelle district and Uganda, and south to Urungu and central Angola, but not in the highlands of the Katanga or Marungu.  It has been taken in the forest areas of the Kasai and Lomami districts, and is found nearly to the border of the Lado district, though there restricted to patches of heavy forest.</p>
				<p>The Upper Guinea race is <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Pogoniulus leucolaima togoensis">P. l. togoensis</taxonName> (Neumann)</taxon>, distinguished by its lower breast and belly being rather bright yellow, its wing usually short, scarcely exceeding 51 mm.  <taxonName idx_name="Pogoniulus leucolaima leucolaima">Pogoniulus l. leucolaima</taxonName> is slightly larger, wing 50&ndash;54 mm., and more greenish yellow on lower breast and abdomen.  Specimens from Boma, the Congo mouth, and northern Angola may be a little paler yellow beneath than those of the Upper Congo, but the range of typical <taxonName idx_name="Pogoniulus leucolaima leucolaima">leucolaima</taxonName> seems to extend from the Cameroon coast and Angola through the Upper Congo and Kasai to the northeastern Uelle and the Semliki Valley.  <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Pogoniulus leucolaima poensis">P. l. poensis</taxonName> (Alexander)</taxon> is a supposedly larger race of Fernando Po.</p>
				<p><taxon><taxonName idx_name="Pogoniulus leucolaima nyans&aelig;">P. l. nyans&aelig;</taxonName> (Neumann)</taxon>, of Uganda and the western shore of Lake Victoria, is a trifle more greenish below than <taxonName idx_name="Pogoniulus leucolaima leucolaima">leucolaima</taxonName>, and has slightly longer wings, 52&ndash;56 mm.  <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Pogoniulus leucolaima mfumbiri">P. l. mfumbiri</taxonName> (O.-Grant)</taxon>, of the mountain forests along the eastern Congo border, is distinctly duller and greener below than any of the foregoing, as well as larger, its wing measuring 53&ndash;59 mm.  <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Pogoniulus leucolaima urungensis">P. l. urungensis</taxonName> (Reichenow)</taxon> was described from the southern end
<pb n="500" id="t000120-p00506c.tif"/> of Lake Tanganyika, and may extend westward to Dilolo.  It may be synonymous with <taxonName idx_name="Pogoniulus leucolaima nyans&aelig;">nyans&aelig;</taxonName>.</p>
				<p>The calling of these tiny barbets is so common and continuous in the Upper Congo forests that one soon ceases to notice it, as though it had become an integral part of the atmosphere.  The natives of the southern Uelle say that they &quot;beat bark-cloth,&quot; referring to the sound of the blows of an ivory mallet on fig-bark laid over a thin log.  To this may be compared the English name of tinker-bird.  An attentive listener will notice that such notes are sometimes produced very rapidly, with a slight pause as though for breath after eight or ten syllables, or at other times more slowly&mdash;only three per second&mdash;with the pause coming after four or five syllables.  These slower notes are those of <taxonName>Pogoniulus leucolaima</taxonName>, as we ascertained by following up their authors, male birds perching almost motionless in a bush or tree.  The sounds are not very loud, but have considerable carrying power, and are heard at all times of the day.  I wrote them &quot;c&obreve;k c&obreve;k c&obreve;k c&obreve;k, c&obreve;k c&obreve;k c&obreve;k c&obreve;k c&obreve;k&mdash;&quot; but the words &quot;tonk-tonk-tonk&quot; have been used by other observers.  During the performance the head is raised somewhat and the neck swells, though the bill is little opened if at all.  In the highlands of Kenya Colony sounds exactly similar are produced by <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Pogoniulus bilineatus jacksoni">P. bilineatus jacksoni</taxonName> (Sharpe)</taxon>.</p>
				<p><taxonName idx_name="Pogoniulus leucolaima">P. leucolaima</taxonName> has another hoarser note, and the two birds I collected as they gave it proved to be females.  This is best written &quot;kkkkk, kkkkk, kkkkk, kkkkk&mdash;,&quot; and may be repeated some eight or ten times.  It may be likened to one of the calls of <taxonName idx_name="Pogoniulus erythronotos">P. erythronotos</taxonName>, but is uttered more rapidly, and is by no means so loud.</p>
				<p>In the Ituri this species is abundant, and often seen in clearings.  In the southern Uelle it is more restricted to woods, though common about Niangara.  At Boma it is not uncommon and calls exactly as in the Ituri.</p>
				<p>A nest, which I saw being excavated in a small tree near Medje, was like a diminutive woodpecker hole.  From Avakubi northward it is clear from our dissections that the breeding season comes regularly in July, August, and September.  Birds taken at other times of year showed little or no enlargement of the gonads.  That the rainy season is thus their time of reproduction is upheld by my finding a breeding male at Boma (south of the equator) in January.</p>
				<p>Mr. Bates<note n="1">1909, Ibis, p. 18; 1911, Ibis, p. 507.</note> in the Cameroon found many nests with eggs and young, distributed among most of the months in the year.  Tall stumps left in clearings were the usual nesting sites, and the holes were about 100 mm.
<pb n="501" id="t000120-p00507c.tif"/> deep with round entrance 20 mm. in diameter.  Two, or occasionally three eggs are laid, glossy white, 15&ndash;18 mm. &times; 11.5&ndash;13 mm.</p>
				<p>Eleven stomachs were examined by us, small fruits and insects often being found together.  Thus nine stomachs contained insect-remains, six fruit, and two seeds, evidently from fruit.  One bird was noted as having had an ant in its beak.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;Mountain forests along the eastern Congo border, from Ruwenzori to the highlands northwest of Lake Tanganyika; usually at altitudes between 5000 and 8400 feet.  In habits and voice there is no difference from the birds of the lowlands to the westward, but most of the mountain birds are larger and paler in color beneath.  One female, however, from the Bugongo Ridge on West Ruwenzori, at 7100 feet, is
<pb n="502" id="t000120-p00508c.tif"/> indistinguishable from <taxonName idx_name="Pogoniulus leucolaima leucolaima">P. l. leucolaima</taxonName>, and its wing measures only 51 mm.</p>
				<p>Our five skins of <taxonName idx_name="Pogoniulus leucolaima mfumbiri">mfumbiri</taxonName> come from Kalongi on West Ruwenzori, Mulu in mountains northwest of Lake Edward, and the northwest slope of Mt. Mikeno.  Their wings vary from 53.5 to 57 mm.  Judging from the frequency with which these tinker-birds are heard, I regard them as common in the lower mountain forests on Ruwenzori, west of Lake Edward, the Kivu Volcanoes, and the mountains west of the Ruzizi Valley.</p>

It seems permissible therefore to regard <taxonName idx_name="Pogoniulus bilineatus kandti">kandti</taxonName> as synonymous with <taxonName idx_name="Pogoniulus bilineatus jacksoni">jacksoni</taxonName>.</p>
				<p>In view of the distribution of <taxonName idx_name="Pogoniulus leucolaima mfumbiri">P. leucolaima mfumbiri</taxonName> in the eastern
<pb n="503" id="t000120-p00509c.tif"/> Congo, it is most surprising that a race of <taxonName idx_name="Pogoniulus bilineatus">P. bilineatus</taxonName> has been found on Kwidjwi Island in Lake Kivu.  Besides the type, said to come from Lake Kivu, there is another example collected by von Stegmann on Kwidjwi in October, 1908.</p>
				<p>During the brief call of the steamer at Bitoro on the west side of Kwidjwi Island, July 7, 1927, I noted that several barbets were heard calling like <taxonName idx_name="Pogoniulus leucolaima">P. leucolaima</taxonName>.

				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;West Africa from eastern Sierra Leone to the Gaboon and Lower Congo, including Fernando Po; thence eastward through the Congo forest to the Ituri and Semliki rivers, and Budongo, Mabira, and Kyetume in Uganda.  In Sierra Leone, Liberia, and the Gold Coast Colony it is represented by <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Pogoniulus subsulphureus chrysopyga">P. s. chrysopyga</taxonName> (Shelley)</taxon>,
<pb n="504" id="t000120-p00510c.tif"/> with whitish superciliary line.  <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Pogoniulus subsulphureus subsulphureus">P. s. subsulphureus</taxonName> (Fraser)</taxon>,<note n="1">1843, P. Z. S. Lond., p. 3 (Clarence, Fernando Po).</note> apparently confined to the island of Fernando Po, has light yellow stripes on the side of the head, a large bill, throat pale yellow, and remaining underparts light grayish green with a wash of yellow.  The wings, in a series of 18 skins, measure 48&ndash;52 mm.; culmen (to base) 12.5&ndash;14 mm.</p>
				<p>Mainland birds from the Cameroon and Congo have wings of nearly the same size, 48&ndash;51 mm.; but their bills are smaller, culmen (to base) 12&ndash;12.7 mm.; throats deeper yellow, and lower parts more strongly washed with yellow.  I cannot find any difference between Ituri specimens and those of the Cameroon, Gaboon, and Kasai, so the name <taxonName idx_name="Pogoniulus subsulphureus flavimentum">P. s. flavimentum</taxonName> may be employed for the whole Lower Guinea race.</p>
				<p>The present species is somewhat more closely restricted to heavy forests than <taxonName idx_name="Pogoniulus leucolaima">leucolaima</taxonName>.  Whereas the latter was rather common near Niangara, <taxonName idx_name="Pogoniulus subsulphureus flavimentum">P. s. flavimentum</taxonName> was not heard north of the village of Kongoli, near Rungu.  There are also specimens in the Hamburg Museum collected by Schubotz at Angu and Koloka, farther west.  On the southern side of the Congo forest this species extends to Luluabourg, where Father Callewaert has obtained several specimens and to Kasanga near the middle Kwango River, where Dr. Schwetz secured one.  On the east I have heard it in the forest of the Semliki Valley, but not on the mountains.</p>
				<p>The more rapid calling of the yellow-browed tinker-bird has already been mentioned, its shrill little &quot;cok&quot; is repeated for long periods, but after every eight or ten syllables there is a slight though perceptible break.  Such notes, I ascertained, are given by males.  A less common note of the species is a series of similar sounds, increasing in rapidity and without a break, but gradually dying out.  &quot;Cok, cok, cok cok-cok-cok-cok-cok-cok-k-k.&quot;  It is only uttered at considerable intervals.</p>
				<p>So far as I can say, there is no difference in the general habits of <taxonName idx_name="Pogoniulus leucolaima">leucolaima</taxonName> and <taxonName idx_name="Pogoniulus subsulphureus">subsulphureus</taxonName>.  Breeding males of the latter were taken at Nala and Pawa in July, while nearer Avakubi there was little enlargement of the gonads in November and December.  I think it possible, notwithstanding, that they may breed throughout the year on the equator. Nests found in the Cameroon by Bates<note n="2">1909, Ibis, p. 18; 1911, Ibis, p. 507.</note> were like those of <taxonName idx_name="Pogoniulus leucolaima">P. leucolaima</taxonName>, holes cut in dead limbs.  Two eggs or young seemed to be the rule, and nestlings made a continual tinkling noise, much like that of adults.</p>
				<p>In the four stomachs examined there were only small fruits, usually of orange-red color, such as are eaten also by <taxonName idx_name="Pogoniulus leucolaima">P. leucolaima</taxonName> and by a small sunbird, <taxonName>Anthreptes collaris</taxonName>.</p>

				<p>ADULT MALE.&mdash;Iris dark brown, bill black, feet dark bluish gray.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;From the Casamance River through the forests of Upper and Lower Guinea to the Portuguese Congo, and eastward to the southern Uelle district and the slopes of Ruwenzori.  Father Callewaert has sent us a half-dozen specimens from the Luluabourg in the Kasai district, and Doctor Schwetz obtained one for the Congo Museum at Kasanga, near the middle Kwango River.</p>
				<p>Although distinctly a bird of the forest districts, the red-rumped tinker-bird, we found, is more common near the borders of the Ituri forest, as at Medje, than in its center near Avakubi.  It extends northward in the Uelle district to within a day&apos;s march of Niangara.  Often it is heard calling from the higher trees, hidden in the foliage, and takes wing if one stands too long below looking for it.</p>
				<p>Its notes are characteristic, a slow succession of &quot;coks,&quot; following each other at two-thirds or three-quarters of a second, without any periodic break.  They may continue regularly for several minutes, and are often loud enough to be heard 400 yards.  Thus they are louder and slower than the corresponding call of <taxonName idx_name="Pogoniulus chrysoconus">P. chrysoconus</taxonName>.  Another call of <taxonName idx_name="Pogoniulus erythronotos">erythronotos</taxonName> is hoarser, &quot;kahkk, kahkk, kahkk&mdash;&quot; given at about the same intervals as the preceding, but never continuing for long.</p>
				<p>As a rule this red-rumped species is not found in mountain forests, but on the west slope of Ruwenzori, near the Butahu River, it is of regular occurrence.  We secured two in immature plumage at 7400 and 7900 feet, besides seeing two more, one of them at 7000 feet.</p>
				<p>Reproduction takes place in the rainy season, for at Medje and Nala we took breeding males in July and September, and young in September
<pb n="506" id="t000120-p00512c.tif"/> and October.  In the Cameroon, on the other hand, Bates<note n="1">1911, Ibis, p. 507.</note> recorded a female, taken in February, with a nest containing two nestlings.  The nest was in a soft-wood stump.</p>
				<p>Fruit forms the greater part of the diet, for we found small berries in all of the five stomachs examined, varied only by an insect and two small spiders.</p>

				<p>In the Upper Congo DuChaillu&apos;s barbet is a fairly common bird in the whole region of heavy forest, but is more often heard than seen. Only seldom does it come out into the larger trees in clearings to feed on small wild figs.  Its call is easily recognized, a soft rolling whirr or purr (&quot;b-r-r-r-r-r&mdash;&quot;), lasting one and one-half or two seconds.  This curious note was also given by a brood of nestlings brought to us by natives. Beginning with a couple of distinct low notes, as of discontent, it ran into a sort of musical purr.  At the same time the head was extended, beak downwards, and the neck swelled decidedly, the skin showing at its sides.  A young female gave it, as well as the young males.</p>
				<p>In addition to the published records, the Hamburg Museum has a male specimen from Koloka, Uelle district, collected by Schubotz; and Dr. Schouteden brought one from the Rutshuru River.  I have seen and heard this barbet a number of times at Lukolela, but it seems to extend little into gallery forests either north or south of the forest.  It scarcely crosses the Uelle River, and is not yet recorded from the Kasai district.</p>
				<p>The nesting season is a long one, for breeding females were taken in the Ituri in early February, August, and September, and one of the nestlings also in April.  Fruit is the main source of nourishment, and was contained in five stomachs, which otherwise showed only a single small snail shell.</p>

				<p>SPECIMENS.&mdash;Stanleyville, 2 &male;, &female;, Nov. 1; &female; juv., Aug. 16.  Muny&eacute; Katoto, near Bafwaboli, &female;, Sept. 10.  Bafwasende, &male;, Sept. 23.

				<p>ADULTS.&mdash;In the vicinity of Stanleyville both sexes have the iris reddish brown to scarlet; skin of cheeks (though not entirely naked) dark brownish pink or dull red brown; bill dusky brown; feet dark gray or dusky brown.  At Avakubi the adult
<pb n="510" id="t000120-p00516c.tif"/> male has iris dark brown, adult female has iris brownish yellow.  At Medje adult males have iris rather light brown, that of females being yellow.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;Cameroon-Gaboon coast, Kwamouth, and Kwango River, east to Mt. Elgon, Nandi district, Rutshuru Valley, and Lulua district in the southeast Congo.  Three races are recognizable on size; the small <taxonName idx_name="Gymnobucco bonapartei bonapartei">G. b. bonapartei</taxonName> in the forest regions from the lower Ituri River westward; the very large <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Gymnobucco bonapartei cinereiceps">G. b. cinereiceps</taxonName> Sharpe</taxon><note n="1">1891, Ibis, p. 122 (Mt. Elgon).</note> from Mt. Elgon to Nandi; and <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Gymnobucco bonapartei intermedius">G. b. intermedius</taxonName> van Someren</taxon> in the intervening areas from the Upper Uelle district to the eastern edge of the Congo forest and Uganda, as well as in the eastern Lulua district.</p>
				<p>The wing in twelve Gaboon examples of <taxonName idx_name="Gymnobucco bonapartei bonapartei">G. b. bonapartei</taxonName> measures 76&ndash;85 mm., while the same measurement in specimens from Medje is 77&ndash; 84 mm., and from Luluabourg 79&ndash;84.5 mm.  Wings of <taxonName idx_name="Gymnobucco bonapartei intermedius">intermedius</taxonName> measure 88&ndash;95 mm. near Niangara, 85&ndash;94 in the Mawambi-Beni area, 87&ndash;99 in Uganda, and 89 mm. at Kinda in the Lulua district.  The wing-length of <taxonName idx_name="Gymnobucco bonapartei cinereiceps">cinereiceps</taxonName> is 96&ndash;104 mm., and a few examples of <taxonName idx_name="Gymnobucco bonapartei intermedius">intermedius</taxonName> from the eastern Congo approach these dimensions.  Two females from Djugu have wings 100 and 101 mm., a female from the western base of Ruwenzori 98 mm.</p>
				<p>In the Gaboon, Ansorge noted the eye-color as &quot;blood-red&quot; in both sexes of <taxonName idx_name="Gymnobucco bonapartei bonapartei">bonapartei</taxonName>, and as brown in some of the males.  Eastward to Bafwaboli the sexes are alike in having reddish eyes.  Near Avakubi and Medje the iris of <taxonName idx_name="Gymnobucco bonapartei bonapartei">bonapartei</taxonName> begins to change to the yellowish color seen in <taxonName idx_name="Gymnobucco bonapartei intermedius">intermedius</taxonName>; and there is an unusual sexual difference, with brighter color in females.  The light yellow color of the iris in both sexes of <taxonName idx_name="Gymnobucco bonapartei intermedius">intermedius</taxonName> and <taxonName idx_name="Gymnobucco bonapartei cinereiceps">cinereiceps</taxonName> is confirmed by notes on the labels of specimens collected by Camburn, van Someren, Turner, and Grauer.</p>
				<p><taxonName idx_name="Gymnobucco bonapartei bonapartei">G. b. bonapartei</taxonName> extends from the Cameroon River to the Gaboon, east to Poko and the central Ituri forest, and south to Kwamouth, the southern Kasai district, and perhaps the Kwango River.  A common bird in all the forest region of the Upper Congo, seen in trees along roads and near villages.  It has never been taken in the Mayombe forest or the Lower Congo.</p>
				<p>Compared with most of the other barbets of the Congo, this species might almost be called mute.  Its ordinary note is weak, something between a chirp and a whistle, but occasionally an unpleasant note is given that reminded me of a lawn-mower or a sewing-machine, prolonged but not loud.  As the birds perch on their nesting trees the tufts of feathers stand up at such an angle as to be rather conspicuous.  They fly considerable
<pb n="511" id="t000120-p00517c.tif"/> distances in search of fruit, visiting <taxonName>Ficus</taxonName> trees or plants of that genus supported on other trees; but they never come down close to the ground, nor do they visit the more remote parts of the forest.</p>
				<p>About large dead trees in clearings, where it nests, it is seen in numbers, for several pairs&mdash;sometimes twenty or more&mdash;usually chisel out their nest-holes in the trunk or large limbs of the same tree.  Three or four young are contained in a nest, and a set of four white eggs was secured at Medje.  These measured 23.2&ndash;23.8 mm. &times; 17.3&ndash;17.9.  In the Cameroon, Bates<note n="1">1905, Ibis, p. 92; 1909, Ibis, pp. 16, 17.</note> has found small bats of the genus <taxonName>Nyctinomus</taxonName> roosting in holes in the midst of an occupied nesting colony.  These colonies are parasitized by honey-guides, for he took a nestling of <taxonName>Melignothes conirostris</taxonName> from one of the holes.  At Lukolela in December, 1930, I found at least five of these same honey-guides about a nesting tree of <taxonName>Gymnobucco bonapartei</taxonName>, and saw one clinging at the entrance to a barbet&apos;s nest. At Medje this brown barbet seemed to be breeding most actively during the dry season, from December to March inclusive, but two birds with enlarged gonads were also taken in September.</p>
				<p>Notes on the contents of seven stomachs show that insects, including a wasp and a bug, were eaten by three of the birds, fruit (largely small berries) being present in five cases.  Small wild figs often attract numbers of these barbets.</p>

				<p>In habits this larger subspecies is like typical <taxonName idx_name="Gymnobucco bonapartei bonapartei">bonapartei</taxonName>; but it is more local, because of its partiality for wooded areas in a more or less open country.

				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;Gold Coast to Cameroon, Gaboon, and Mayombe forest.  Within our limits it is known only from a single specimen taken by Dr. Schouteden at Butu Polo.</p>
				<p>This species differs from <taxonName idx_name="Gymnobucco calvus">G. calvus</taxonName> mainly in the possession of tufts of bristly feathers over the nostrils.

				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;Upper Congo forest, from Libenge on the Ubangi River and Kunungu near Bolobo, eastward to Poko, the Semliki Valley, the vicinity of Kasongo, and Luebo in the Kasai.</p>
				<p>This is a darker bird than <taxonName idx_name="Gymnobucco calvus">G. calvus</taxonName> or <taxonName idx_name="Gymnobucco calvus">G. peli</taxonName>, very similar in bodycolor to <taxonName idx_name="Gymnobucco bonapartei">G. bonapartei</taxonName>.  The tufts of bristly feathers around the base of the bill are like those of <taxonName idx_name="Gymnobucco peli">G. peli</taxonName>, but the bill is blackish in color.</p>
				<p>The specimen collected by Schubotz at Libenge is in the Hamburg Museum.  The Congo Museum has a series of twenty-eight skins, including two from Lukolela.  Examples from the Semliki Valley look slightly darker and larger than those from other parts of the range, and have wings 85&ndash;91 mm. long.

				<p>Sladen&apos;s barbet is evidently rather common in the vicinity of Buta, but thus far no specimen has been collected in the central districts of the Upper Congo forest.

In the Rothschild Collection there are specimens from Manyanga and Lutete in the Lower Congo, and from Ndala Tando in northern Angola.</p>
				<p>Dr. Schwetz has recently collected two more at Thysville, where I found them in December, 1914, in one of the patches of woods not far
<pb n="515" id="t000120-p00521u.tif"/> from the station.  A dozen or more of these brown barbets were sitting on a large dead tree in which they had cut out their nests exactly as <taxonName idx_name="Gymnobucco bonapartei">G. bonapartei</taxonName> does.  The two male birds collected were in breeding condition and both had eaten only fruit.  Many small starlings (<taxonName>P&oelig;optera lugubris</taxonName>) were perching near by, and apparently they were nesting in holes fashioned by the barbets.  The eggs of the barbet are certainly glossy white, and those of the Upper Guinea race are said to measure 23 &times; 20 mm. and to be laid usually in sets of three.</p>

				<p>The white stripes on supercilium and cheek reappear in <taxonName idx_name="Trichol&aelig;ma hirsutum chapini">T. h. chapini</taxonName> of the Uelle, Upper Congo, and Kasai, but both sexes have throat gray, streaked with black.

				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;From near Nola in French Equatorial Africa, Molundu in southeast Cameroon, and Lukolela on the Congo, eastward to Mauda and Abimva in the Uelle, the region near Mawambi in the Ituri, and the vicinity of Kabambare.  Southward it reaches Katabwa in the
<pb n="519" id="t000120-p00525c.tif"/> southern Kasai, and the Congo Museum has one specimen supposedly from Dilolo.</p>
				<p>From Molundu, where flavipunctatum is said to occur, the Hamburg Museum has also a skin of <taxonName idx_name="Trichol&aelig;ma hirsutum chapini">chapini</taxonName>.  In the upper Sanaga district, according to Grote,<note n="1">1925, J. f. O., pp. 80, 81.</note> Tessmann secured an intermediate between this race and <taxonName idx_name="Trichol&aelig;ma hirsutum flavipunctatum">flavipunctatum</taxonName>.  The eastern limits of <taxonName idx_name="Trichol&aelig;ma hirsutum chapini">chapini</taxonName> are difficult to state, because it differs so little from <taxonName idx_name="Trichol&aelig;ma hirsutum ansorgii">T. h. ansorgii</taxonName>.  The wing of <taxonName idx_name="Trichol&aelig;ma hirsutum chapini">chapini</taxonName> averages slightly shorter, its throat is usually more narrowly streaked with black, and its underparts generally more yellowish green.  The specimens most brightly colored beneath are apt to be females, and in all the races of this species females may be recognized by the deeper yellow spotting of the upperparts.  These markings in males are lemon-yellow. The difference is already evident in the juvenal plumage.</p>
				<p>From Lukolela to the Ituri and southern Uelle we found <taxonName idx_name="Trichol&aelig;ma hirsutum chapini">chapini</taxonName> a common bird in forest and second-growth woods, betraying its presence by cooing notes which are usually repeated for a short spell, instead of continuing more slowly for long periods like those of <taxonName>Trachyl&aelig;mus purpuratus</taxonName>. Of rather solitary habit, it is usually seen perching in the trees, though I have watched one clinging to the under side of a slanting dead branch of a parasol tree (<taxonName>Musanga</taxonName>) and hammering away exactly like a woodpecker.  Doubtless this performance occurs only during nest-building.</p>
				<p>The majority of our specimens, though adult, were non-breeding.  A female with enlarged ovary was taken at Medje in August, and a nestling two-thirds grown in September, so it is safe to assert that the species breeds during the rains.  Fully fledged but immature birds were taken at Niangara and Avakubi in November, at a season when none seemed to be breeding.  Noticeable enlargement of the gonads was, however, observed in two cases in January and February.  As in many other species of barbets, the young nestling has on each heel a patch of scales with a rough rasp-like surface, which wears down as the bird grows up.<note n="2">See Gyldenstolpe, 1917, Arkiv f. Zool., XI, No. 12, pp. 1&ndash;15.</note>

				<p>Fruit forms the principal sustenance, and was present in every one of the twenty stomachs examined.  Remains of insects were found but twice, one of them being a small beetle.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;From eastern Cape Province north to Angola, the Ruzizi Valley, and Lamu on the east coast; but not in dry Southwest Africa.  <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Lybius torquatus torquatus">L. t. torquatus</taxonName> (Dumont)</taxon> is largely restricted to the region south of the Zambesi Valley, and has the yellow of underparts dull and mixed with dark gray, back dull brown with little black vermiculation; wings 89&ndash;98 mm. <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Lybius zomb&aelig;">L. zomb&aelig;</taxonName> (Shelley)</taxon> is regarded by Grote as a gray-faced race of this species, living to the east and southeast of Lake Nyasa.<note n="1">See also Vincent, 1933, B. B. O. C., LIII, pp. 149&ndash;151.</note>
				</p>
				<p><taxon><taxonName idx_name="Lybius torquatus congicus">L. t. congicus</taxonName> (Reichenow)</taxon> resembles typical <taxonName idx_name="Lybius torquatus torquatus">torquatus</taxonName>, having wings 87-96 mm., but is more distinctly vermiculated with black on back and lesser wing-coverts, the belly brighter yellow.  It occupies the south-eastern
<pb n="522" id="t000120-p00528c.tif"/> Congo and neighboring countries, but is replaced at the northern end of Lake Tanganyika by <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Lybius torquatus pumilio">L. t. pumilio</taxonName> Grote</taxon>, similar in color, with wings only 83&ndash;91 mm. long.  The smallest form of all is <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Lybius torquatus irroratus">L. t. irroratus</taxonName> Cabanis</taxon>, of the coast of East Africa from Lamu to Ugogo.  Its wing measures 78&ndash;86 mm.; the vermiculation of the back extends to the greater wing-coverts, and the red feathers of crown and fore-neck have narrower tips.</p>
				<p><taxonName idx_name="Lybius torquatus congicus">L. t. congicus</taxonName> is distributed from southwest Tanganyika Territory to Marungu, Katanga, and Malanje, Angola.  Specimens from Tembwe on Lake Tanganyika belong to this larger race, and those of the Benguella highland are closer to it than to typical <taxonName idx_name="Lybius torquatus torquatus">torquatus</taxonName>.  The species is not known from the Kasai district.  The type specimen of <taxon><taxonName>Barbatula rubrigularis</taxonName> Dubois</taxon>, in the Congo Museum, is simply a young bird of the present form, with wings and tail not yet fully grown.</p>
				<p>The black-collared barbet is a common bird in the savannas of the Katanga and Marungu.  &quot;Despite their clumsy exterior,&quot; wrote B&ouml;hm, &quot;these barbets are gay and lively creatures.  One sees them in flocks seeking the fruit-bearing sycamores (<taxonName>Ficus</taxonName>), where they whirr quickly hither and thither, beating the short tail; and when two meet they burst out in joyous call which changes suddenly to a triple whistled note.&quot;</p>
				<p>In Northern Rhodesia, according to Pitman, they nest in September and October.  At Moba, northern Marungu, Rockefeller and Murphy collected specimens in breeding condition in February.  The nest of the South African race is excavated in dead wood, and its glossy white eggs, laid in sets of four, measure around 25 &times; 21.5 mm.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;Lowlands about the northern end of Lake Tanganyika, including the Ruzizi Valley, and extending westward to the Lualaba River.  Specimens in the Congo Museum from Kabalo agree better with <taxonName idx_name="Lybius torquatus pumilio">pumilio</taxonName> than with <taxonName idx_name="Lybius torquatus congicus">congicus</taxonName>, though the difference between these two

				<p>ADULTS OF BOTH SEXES.&mdash;Iris medium brown, eyelids and bill black, feet blackish.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;Abyssinia and the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan to Uganda, Lake Albert, and the Upper Uelle district.  <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Lybius guifsobalito guifsobalito">L. g. guifsobalito</taxonName> Hermann</taxon>, with wings 85&ndash;93 mm. long, ranges from southeastern Eritrea and Abyssinia to the Blue Nile district of the Sudan. <taxonName idx_name="Lybius guifsobalito ugand&aelig;">L. g. ugand&aelig;</taxonName>, with wings 77&ndash;86 mm. and narrower yellow and whitish edgings on wings, occupies the savannas of the upper White Nile, Uelle district, west shore of Lake Albert, and Uganda to the north shore of Lake Victoria.</p>
				<p>In our territory <taxonName idx_name="Lybius guifsobalito ugand&aelig;">ugand&aelig;</taxonName> is limited to the savannas of the northeastern border, but is common about Faradje, and frequent also at Kasenyi on the western shore of Lake Albert.  They not only dwell among the scrubby trees of the grasslands, but come to fruit trees planted about the government posts, as at Faradje.  Parties of five or six birds are common, uttering discordant notes in chorus.  The most characteristic of these is a dry &quot;hic-cup, hic-cup, hic-cup, hic-cup&mdash;&quot; introduced by a medley of harsh sounds.  This might also be written &quot;cha-cha-cha&mdash;cho-ko, cho-ko, cho-ko&mdash;.&quot;  A single nasal &quot;caw&quot; suggestive of our American fish-crow, is also a part of their vocabulary.</p>
				<p>The breeding season in the Uelle, I believe, is during the rains; but only a single male bird (March 2) showed any considerable enlargement
<pb n="524" id="t000120-p00530c.tif"/> of the sexual glands.  A full-grown but immature female was taken in November.</p>
				<p>Of thirteen stomachs, all but one contained fruit of some kind.  The pink pulp of guavas was noted twice, papaya twice, small red peppers twice, and some wild berries twice, the remaining fruit not recognizable. One bird had eaten only an insect; among the others, one had taken a large black ant, and one a large hemipter.</p>

C., X, p. 13 (Kamonyi); 1933, Rev. Z. A., XXII, p. 377 (Rugobagoba).</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;Country southwest and west of Lake Victoria, as far as central Ruanda.  Known thus far only from the four localities listed above.  Kamonyi and Rugobagoba are on the highland not far from Kigali in Ruanda.  At these places Douce obtained two adults, not sexed.</p>
				<p><taxonName idx_name="Lybius rubrifacies">L. rubrifacies</taxonName> seems closely allied to <taxonName idx_name="Lybius guifsobalito">L. guifsobalito</taxonName>, and the black-and-brown feathers of its chin and upper throat show traces of red at their tips.  But the red of its forehead is much less extensive than in <taxonName idx_name="Lybius guifsobalito">guifsobalito</taxonName>, its wing-coverts are black without pale edgings, and its tail is longer.  Douce&apos;s specimens have wings 89, 91 mm., tail 54, 56, culmen to base 22, 24, metatarsus 22, 22.5.</p>
				<p>The habits of <taxonName idx_name="Lybius rubrifacies">rubrifacies</taxonName> may be expected to resemble those of <taxonName idx_name="Lybius guifsobalito">guifsobalito</taxonName>. It is not true, as stated by Friedmann,<note n="1">1930, Bull. 153, U. S. Nat. Mus., p. 436.</note> that the two species are found together.</p>

				<p>ADULT MALE.&mdash;Iris light brown, becoming whitish on outer rim; bill black; feet very dark greenish brown.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;Bogosland, Sennar, and Kordofan, southward to the Uelle district and westward to northern Cameroon, Asben, and Senegal.  The geographic variation in color is slight, and it cannot be determined whether Leach&apos;s type came from Northeast Africa
<pb n="525" id="t000120-p00531c.tif"/> or from Senegal.  Neumann<note n="1">1917, J. f. O., Festschr. A. Reichenow, p. 201, footnote; 1927, Ibis, p. 503.</note> and Hartert<note n="2">1921, Nov. Zool., XXVIII, p. 107; 1924," idem, XXXI, p. 23.</note> have argued that Senegal should be taken as the type locality, but it seems better to accept Ogilvie-Grant&apos;s earlier designation of Abyssinia.</p>
				<p><taxon><taxonName idx_name="Lybius vieilloti vieilloti">Lybius v. vieilloti</taxonName> (Leach)</taxon> would thus be the race extending from Eritrea to Darfur, the Bahr-el-Ghazal, and the Uelle.  It is less thickly marked with red on the breast than <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Lybius vieilloti rubescens">L. v. rubescens</taxonName> (Temminck)</taxon>, which ranges from Senegal to the savannas near the bend of the Ubangi River.<note n="3"><taxon><taxonName idx_name="Lybius vieilloti tessmanni">L. v. tessmanni</taxonName> Grote</taxon>, 1923, O.

Zool., XXXI, p. 23 (Tebeig, Asben).</note> which is said to be paler in coloration on its whole upperparts.</p>
				<p>In habits Vieillot&apos;s barbet is similar to <taxonName idx_name="Lybius guifsobalito">L. guifsobalito</taxonName>, and frequents the small trees of the savanna.  Some of our specimens were captured there in a nesting hole by natives.  We met with the species only near Niangara, and did not find it common.  Only the bird taken in May showed some enlargement of the reproductive organs.  Stomach contents, noted in two cases, included fruit in both instances, and two large black ants eaten by one of the birds.</p>
				<p>In Darfur Admiral Lynes<note n="5">1925, Ibis, p. 349.</note> found that the breeding season extended from April to July.  The call of this barbet, he stated, is audible for a considerable distance, and best described as &quot;yodeling,&quot; a succession of two flute-like notes widely separated.  Two birds, almost certainly male and female, are responsible for it, one giving the low and the other the high note.  They sit facing each other on a bough, and at each dissyllable bow to each other.</p>
				<p>A nest found in Darfur in early May was excavated in the spongy stem of a small <taxonName>Adenium</taxonName> tree, at four feet from the ground.  The eggs were three in number, nearly glossless white, and averaged 25 &times; 21 mm.</p>

				<p>ADULTS.&mdash;Iris brown, bill and orbits blackish, feet dusky.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;From southern Ankole and Kavirondo through Uganda to Mt. Elgon and the Lado district.  Thence west through the savannas of the Uelle to the Shari River and Northern Nigeria. <taxonName idx_name="Lybius leucocephalus leucocephalus">L. l. leucocephalus</taxonName>, with white of fore-neck extending only to upper breast, occupies the eastern part of the range, while from the Ubangi westward it is replaced by <taxonName idx_name="Lybius leucocephalus adamau&aelig;">L. l. adamau&aelig;</taxonName>, with more white on the breast, so that only the abdomen and flanks are brownish black streaked with white.  Specimens of <taxonName idx_name="Lybius leucocephalus leucogaster">leucogaster</taxonName> from the Uelle and Mahagi Port have wings 86&ndash;95 mm.  The wing-length in <taxonName idx_name="Lybius leucocephalus adamau&aelig;">adamau&aelig;</taxonName> is said to be 83&ndash;91 mm.</p>
				<pb n="527" id="t000120-p00533c.tif"/>
				<p>Very closely allied to this species are <taxonName>Lybius albicauda</taxonName> and <taxonName idx_name="Lybius senex">senex</taxonName> of eastern Africa and <taxonName idx_name="Lybius leucogaster">L. leucogaster</taxonName> of Benguella.  They replace each other geographically, but their ranges seem not to meet and so they do not intergrade with <taxonName idx_name="Lybius leucocephalus">leucocephalus</taxonName>.</p>
				<p>In Uganda the white-headed barbet is rather common; and while it has been found on the west shore of Lake Albert only at Mahagi Port, I have noted one individual near the new post of Kasindi, at the southern base of the Ruwenzori range.  Colonel Hackars has since collected one at Kadiakadia in the upper Semliki Valley.  In the Uelle it is a bird of the savannas, from Niangara and Nzoro northward, seen also at Garamba.  In parties of four or five it haunts the larger trees on dry ground, such as &quot;sausage-trees&quot; (<taxonName>Kigelia</taxonName>).  The flight is well sustained and rapid, with swiftly beating wings.  This barbet has a very unusual voice, giving a series of shrill metallic notes of two syllables, which I used to recall by the words &quot;king-crown.&quot;  These are repeated energetically from 15 to 20 times, and then die off in a sort of &quot;k-k-k-k&mdash;.&quot; Occasionally they also produce a dry &quot;ch-ch-ch-ch&mdash;&quot; which is not so loud.  I once flushed two of the birds from the ground, the only time I have known any barbet to come to the earth.  None of the Congo woodpeckers, either, was seen feeding on the ground.</p>
				<p>All I can say as to the time of reproduction in the Uelle is that a partly grown nestling was secured through natives in April, and that partial enlargement of the gonads was noted in three birds, in January, September, and October.  This argues for a very long breeding season.</p>
				<p>Seven out of eight stomachs contained only fruit, in one case the inner pulp of a guava.  The remaining bird was the nestling which had been eating some beetles.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;From the Ubangi and Shari rivers westward to northern Cameroon and Haussaland.  This subspecies surely occurs in the northern Ubangi district, for Boyd Alexander collected it at a Catholic Mission on the Ubangi River, a little above the mouth of the Kemo. Dybowski&apos;s specimen, mentioned by Oustalet, came from the upper Kemo River and not from the Ubangi itself.</p>

				<p>SPECIMENS.&mdash;Boma, &male;, Jan. 3; 2 &female;, Jan. 3, 7; &male; juv., Jan. 3.</p>
				<p>ADULTS.&mdash;Iris light yellowish brown or buff, orbit flesh-color; bill whitish; feet pink, with gray claws.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;Landana, Lower Congo, and Angola, east to the Katanga, Marungu, and the country north of Lake Nyasa. <taxonName idx_name="Melanobucco minor minor">M. m. minor</taxonName>, with sides and back of head grayish brown, and back uniform blackish brown, ranges from Benguella north to the Lower Congo and the coast near Landana.  <taxonName idx_name="Melanobucco minor intercedens">M. m. intercedens</taxonName> differs in having the sides of the head white, the nape blackish brown, and the back with a whitish stripe on each side.  It occupies the country between the Lower Congo and the lower Kasai River.  <taxonName idx_name="Melanobucco minor macclounii">M. m. macclounii</taxonName> also has white sides
<pb n="529" id="t000120-p00535c.tif"/> of head, white stripes on back, but upperparts blacker, including hind-crown and hind-neck.  This race ranges from the Kwango River eastward to the north end of Lake Nyasa.</p>
				<p>There is no great difference in wing-length between these subspecies. In three adults of <taxonName idx_name="Melanobucco minor minor">minor</taxonName> from Boma it is 84&ndash;87 mm., and in four others of the same race from the Benguella highland 88&ndash;95 mm.  Six examples of <taxonName idx_name="Melanobucco minor intercedens">intercedens</taxonName> from Kwamouth have wings 87&ndash;92 mm., and a large series of <taxonName idx_name="Melanobucco minor macclounii">macclounii</taxonName> from the southeastern Congo 84&ndash;93 mm.</p>
				<p>In Congo territory <taxonName idx_name="Melanobucco minor minor">L. m. minor</taxonName> is restricted to the area between the cataracts and the coast.  Dybowski&apos;s specimen was not obtained on the Ubangi, but was labeled as coming from &quot;Congo.&quot;  It is no longer in existence.  About Boma the typical race of the pink-bellied barbet is not uncommon in bushes and small trees of the savanna.  It has a long &quot;clicking&quot; note, much like that of <taxonName idx_name="Melanobucco bidentatus">M. bidentatus</taxonName>, which lives in the same district.  All the adults (in January) were non-breeding birds, but the nesting season had just closed, to judge from the young example.  This bird lacks all trace of the red frontal patch, and is generally lighter above than adults.</p>
				<p>Nothing but fruit was found in their stomachs.  In one case it was" identified as the outer covering of a palm nut.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;The country north of Lake Nyasa, westward through Northern Rhodesia to the Katanga, Marungu, the southern Manyema and Kasai districts, and the Kwango River.  Dr. Schwetz brought back a single specimen, plainly <taxonName idx_name="Melanobucco minor macclounii">macclounii</taxonName>, from the Wilhelm Falls on the Kwango, Father Callewaert sent us four from Katabua in the Kasai, and G. F. de Witte obtained two from the Congo Museum at Dilolo.  Count de Baillet-Latour collected a series near Kinda and Lake Musolo, and de Witte others at Kanzenze, Kansenia, and the vicinity of Tenke.  Both De Riemaecker and Schouteden have found this barbet near Elisabethville.  In Marungu, Rockefeller and Murphy took three, and in the Manyema, Pilette secured a single specimen at Mawagongo. In the Upper Katanga, Neave found it common everywhere: &quot;It usually occurs in pairs and is nearly always found in the bush on the banks of streams.  It is very tame and rather inquisitive.&quot;</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;Portuguese Guinea east to the Cameroon, Bahr-el-Ghazal, and southern Abyssinia, south to Angola, the northern end of Lake Tanganyika, Uganda, and South Kavirondo.</p>
				<p><taxon><taxonName idx_name="Melanobucco bidentatus bidentatus">M. b. bidentatus</taxonName> (Shaw)</taxon> has a relatively deep red border on its greater wing-coverts, and rather short wings, 92&ndash;102 mm.  It occupies West Africa from Portuguese Guinea to Southern Nigeria.  <taxonName idx_name="Melanobucco bidentatus friedmanni">M. b. friedmanni</taxonName> is very similar in color with the same deep red border on wing-coverts, but wings averaging longer, 100&ndash;108 mm.  This race is found along the northern edge of the forest belt from the vicinity of Mt. Cameroon to the great bend of the Ubangi, and also from the Gaboon south to northern Angola, approximately to the Kwanza River.  <taxonName idx_name="Melanobucco bidentatus &aelig;quatorialis">M. b. &aelig;quatorialis</taxonName> is distinguished from the foregoing by the lighter, more rose-colored
<pb n="531" id="t000120-p00537c.tif"/> band on the greater wing-coverts, and its wing measures 97&ndash;109 mm. It occupies Uganda and adjacent countries west to the Uelle district. Two adult females collected by Dybowski on the upper Kemo River have red wing-bars wide, as in <taxonName idx_name="Melanobucco bidentatus friedmanni">friedmanni</taxonName>, but of much the same rosy tint as in <taxonName idx_name="Melanobucco bidentatus &aelig;quatorialis">&aelig;quatorialis</taxonName>.  <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Melanobucco bidentatus &aelig;thiops">M. b. &aelig;thiops</taxonName> Neumann</taxon> is barely separable from <taxonName idx_name="Melanobucco bidentatus &aelig;quatorialis">&aelig;quatorialis</taxonName>, the coloration being the same, and the wing 95&ndash;103 mm.  Its bill may be slightly smaller.  The range of <taxonName idx_name="Melanobucco bidentatus &aelig;thiops">&aelig;thiops</taxonName> includes southern Abyssinia and adjacent regions of the Sudan.  The females of this barbet have small black spots on the red feathers just in front of the white flank-patches; these spots are absent in males.</p>
				<p>Within our limits <taxonName idx_name="Melanobucco bidentatus friedmanni">M. b. friedmanni</taxonName> is found mainly in the Lower Congo, where it is not very common.  I regard it as a relatively recent invader from the savannas north of the equator, now occupying territory once inhabited only by <taxonName idx_name="Melanobucco minor">M. minor</taxonName>.  Near Boma I found a small party of <taxonName idx_name="Melanobucco bidentatus friedmanni">friedmanni</taxonName> in a wooded stream-bed, but was unable to secure a specimen. Dr. Schwetz obtained an example there, and another at Thysville.</p>
				<p>A nest described by Bates<note n="1">1911, Ibis, p. 505.</note> from the southern Cameroon was an excavation a foot and a half deep in a tall dead stump, its opening about six feet above the ground.  The four nestlings had been fed on insects, while the adults eat mainly fruit.</p>

				<p>YOUNG.&mdash;Iris dark brownish gray; bill and orbit light gray; feet brownish white, claws dusky.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;Kavirondo district, Mt. Elgon, and Uganda, westward across the Uelle district and Bahr-el-Ghazal to the Shari River. Southward also to Bukoba, and along the eastern margin of the Congo forest and about Lake Kivu to Usumbura at the north end of Lake Tanganyika. Seen only seldom above 5000 feet.  Lacking in all the heavy forest of the Ituri, and even just along its northern edge.</p>
				<p>We did not encounter this conspicuous bird until near Niangara.  It is fond of groves of trees near native villages, and the Mangbetu boys trapped many specimens for us, using single palm-nuts as bait.  About the post of Faradje, too, it was numerous, pecking large holes in any ripe papaya that remained on the trees, along with the colies.  The barbets eat the seeds of the papaya as well.  Small red peppers are also devoured by them, though one bite in this fruit would make my mouth burn for a quarter of an hour.  The voice of this barbet is a prolonged clicking or grinding sound, comparable with that of the wood-hoopoes of the genus <taxonName>Ph&oelig;niculus</taxonName>.</p>
				<p>Breeding takes place over a large period of the year.  Dr. Schouteden obtained a brood of three nestlings at Dramba, April 18.  We took a female ready to lay as early as March 19 at Faradje, noted others with some enlargement of the ovary in August and September, and had nestlings brought by natives near Niangara in November.</p>
				<p>Nests are excavated in dead limbs rather high in trees, and Emin noted that fragments of eggshell were pure white.  Sets must number three or four, but no one has measured the eggs.  The nestlings exhibit
<pb n="533" id="t000120-p00539c.tif"/> the horny rasp-like heel-pads which are characteristic of all young barbets. The juvenal plumage is largely blackish, with white patches on lower back and flanks, but often only a little dull red along the mid-line of the breast and abdomen, although other individuals have a little red on the ear-coverts.</p>
				<p>Sixteen out of nineteen stomachs contained fruit, which was noted in four cases as red peppers, twice as palm-nut pulp, and once wild figs. Nine birds had partaken of insects.  In two cases these were recognized as beetles, and once as a young hemipter.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;Upper White Nile near Redjaf, and the Bahr-el-Ghazal, north to Darfur and west to the valley of the Shari River.  Two specimens now in the Congo Museum were collected by Dr. C. Christy at Mt. Baginzi, on the Congo-Sudan border near Yakuluku; and Emin also secured it at Wandi, only 45 miles northeast of Garamba.</p>
				<p>Lynes<note n="1">1925, Ibis, p. 347.</note> reported that in Darfur it frequents the thickest-foliaged trees, feeding on figs and other fruit.  In flight its wings whir, but the only vocal sound he heard it make was a harsh scraping note.  Breeding took place in July, and the two nests found were borings in live hardwood tree-trunks about fifteen feet from the ground.</p>

It is also lighter and grayer on the breast, with whitish under tail-coverts; but the lower back is greenish in all races of this species.  <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Prodotiscus insignis reichenowi">P. i. reichenowi</taxonName> Madar&agrave;sz</taxon><note n="2">1904, Ann.

At most it is only slightly darker on crown and back, with duller green edgings on secondaries. This form is found about Kilimanjaro and in Usambara.  <taxonName idx_name="Prodotiscus insignis zambesi&aelig;">P. i. zambesi&aelig;</taxonName> has still longer wings, 71&ndash;75 mm., and is lighter in color throughout than <taxonName idx_name="Prodotiscus insignis insignis">P. i. insignis</taxonName>, crown gray with little or no green wash.  Its underparts are a little paler than those of <taxonName idx_name="Prodotiscus insignis ellenbecki">ellenbecki</taxonName>.  We now know that it ranges from Lake Tanganyika, the Katanga, and Benguella south to Southern Rhodesia.</p>
				<p><taxonName idx_name="Prodotiscus insignis insignis">Prodotiscus i. insignis</taxonName> is distinctly a bird of the forest subregion, but little or nothing is known of its ways of life.  Our first specimen was shot by my native hunter, Nekuma, in a tree overlooking a rice field.  Its stomach contained some soft matter which may have been the remains of caterpillars.</p>
				<p>On October 24, 1926, I collected another example, a male, about 28 miles north of the new post of Beni.  It was in a large forest tree at the edge of a clearing, flying actively about and showing its white outer tail-feathers. When perched it resembled a small flycatcher.  In the hand, too, <taxonName>Prodotiscus</taxonName> is very different-looking from a typical honey-guide, having much softer plumage and a bill of very different shape.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;From Tembwe on Lake Tanganyika and the Upper Katanga, south to Mt. Namuli in Mozambique, the Sabi Valley in Southern Rhodesia, and westward to southern Angola.  At Tembwe Dr. Schouteden collected a female in February, 1926, and the Museum of Comparative Zo&ouml;logy has another female from Elisabethville.  In Angola Boulton obtained an example at Quipungo, while the Rothschild Collection contains one bird from Cabe&ccedil;a de Ladr&otilde;es.  Vincent<note n="3">1935, Ibis, pp. 14&ndash;16.</note> found it on Mt. Namuli in Mozambique and Mt. Cholo in southern Nyasaland. He heard it make a subdued squeaky chatter, and noted that while perching it bobs its head ceaselessly up and down.</p>
				<pb n="536" id="t000120-p00542c.tif"/>
				<p>In Southern Rhodesia Mr. D. Townley has seen <taxonName idx_name="Prodotiscus insignis zambesi&aelig;">zambesi&aelig;</taxonName> on five different occasions at Rumani near Salisbury and in the Sabi Valley, and secured three specimens.  The birds frequent heavy woods along streams and were not heard to call.  One example was hawking insects after the manner of a flycatcher.  A male taken in February had gonads enlarged, and in early October another bird of this species was seen entering a nest-hole of <taxonName>Parus niger</taxonName>, as if to lay.</p>
				<p>Townley found remains of insects in their stomachs, noted once as small beetles, but no trace of wax or bees.  In Usambara Moreau<note n="1">1932, Ibis, pp. 666, 667.</note> reported that examination of four stomachs of <taxonName idx_name="Prodotiscus insignis ellenbecki">P. i. ellenbecki</taxonName> showed nothing but scale-insects (<taxonName>Coccid&aelig;</taxonName>) and their waxy exudation.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;Natal north to Angola, savannas of the southeastern Congo, East Africa, Abyssinia, Sennar, and westward to Bozum in French Equatorial Africa.  <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Prodotiscus regulus peasei">P. r. peasei</taxonName> O.-Grant</taxon> of Abyssinia is apparently not a valid race, and of <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Prodotiscus regulus camerunensis">P. r. camerunensis</taxonName> Reichenow</taxon> only the type is known.  Very probably the species does not vary geographically.</p>
				<p>The only examples known from the Congo were taken by Dr. Schouteden at Tembwe on the west shore of Lake Tanganyika and Kabalo on the Lualaba River.  They have wings 76.5 and 80 mm. long, and both have well-marked blackish tips on outer rectrices.  This species is certainly to be expected in the Upper Katanga.</p>
				<p>While Dr. Friedmann reported finding beeswax in this bird&apos;s stomach, other observers have reported that it hunts insects other than bees and behaves very much like a flycatcher.  A.L. Butler noted that it came to feed at the flowers of a <taxonName>Sterculia</taxonName> tree.  During the breeding season, according to Vincent,<note n="2">1930, Bateleur, II, pp. 40, 41.</note> this <taxonName>Prodotiscus</taxonName> utters a loud rasping &quot;zeet - zeet&quot; in flight; but its usual note is a chatter similar to that of P. i. zambesi&aelig;.</p>
				<p>It is suspected of parasitism in breeding, and Vincent<note n="3">1935, Ibis, pp. 15, 16.</note> told of seeing an immature bird accompanying a pair of sparrows (<taxonName>Gymnoris superciliaris</taxonName>) on two successive days.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;From Yaunde in southern Cameroon eastward to the Semliki Valley.  Everywhere rare, and known in the Cameroon only from Yaunde and Bitye.  The first Congo specimen was collected by Borgerhoff at Beni, and in 1925 Dr. Schouteden obtained a second at Kotili on the Itimbiri River.</p>
				<p>Though the texture of the plumage resembles that of <taxonName>Melignothes</taxonName>, the bill of this bird is very slender, approaching the form seen in <taxonName>Prodotiscus</taxonName>. The nostrils of <taxonName>Melignomon</taxonName> are however narrow and slit-like, not open and rounded as in <taxonName>Prodotiscus</taxonName>.  The breast of <taxonName idx_name="Melignomon zenkeri">M. zenkeri</taxonName> has a distinctive dull yellow wash.  In `Die V&ouml;gel,' II, 1914, pp. 60, 61, Professor Reichenow gave a very misleading description of the tails in <taxonName>Melignomon</taxonName> and <taxonName>Melichneutes</taxonName>.  The first-named is stated to have two outer pairs of rectrices successively shortened, whereas but one pair is reduced and distinctly narrowed.  His figure of the tail of <taxonName>Melichneutes</taxonName> is even more inaccurate, and does not at all resemble the tail of the type specimen of <taxonName idx_name="Melignomon sommerfeldi">M. sommerfeldi</taxonName>.</p>
				<p>The two Congo specimens of <taxonName>Melignomon zenkeri</taxonName>, without sex, have wings 80 and 86 mm., tails 50 and 59 mm.  The larger bird is from Beni.
<pb n="538" id="t000120-p00544u.tif"/> Measurements of five Cameroon specimens by Bannerman are: wing 73&ndash; 83 mm., tail 46&ndash;52.</p>
				<p>Nothing is known of the habits of <taxonName idx_name="Melignomon zenkeri">M. zenkeri</taxonName>, but they are likely to resemble those of <taxonName>Melignothes</taxonName>.  No doubt it is a bird of heavy forest. Bates noted that the stomach of his first specimen contained a mass of fine flakes of wax, mixed with some tiny black particles.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;Portuguese Guinea east to Southern Nigeria, Fernando Po, Cameroon, Bahr-el-Ghazal, Kenya Colony, and perhaps Usambara; south to the vicinity of Lake Tanganyika, the Kasai district, and northern Angola.  <taxonName idx_name="Melignothes exilis exilis">M. e. exilis</taxonName>, with wings 63&ndash;74 mm., ranges from northern Angola and Luluabourg in the Kasai district to the forests of Cameroon and Southern Nigeria, and eastward to the Ituri River, the western base of Ruwenzori, and the highland forest northwest of Lake Tanganyika.</p>
				<p>From Upper Guinea three races have been described, with wings varying between 69 and 80 mm.  The first to be named was <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Melignothes exilis willcocksi">M. e. willcocksi</taxonName> (Alexander)</taxon> from Prahsu, Gold Coast; but <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Melignothes exilis ansorgei">M. e. ansorgei</taxonName> (Grant)</taxon> of Portuguese Guinea seems the most distinct, because of its paler grayish
<pb n="539" id="t000120-p00545c.tif"/> coloration and long wing, 80 mm. in the male type.  <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Melignothes exilis leona">M. e. leona</taxonName> (Grant)</taxon> is known from only one specimen taken near Freetown.  Another pale form, perhaps a race of the present species, is <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Melignothes hutsoni">M. hutsoni</taxonName> (Bannerman)</taxon> from the Benue Province of Northern Nigeria.  <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Melignothes exilis poensis">M. e. poensis</taxonName> (Alexander)</taxon> of Fernando Po is grayer on crown and breast than typical <taxonName idx_name="Melignothes exilis exilis">exilis</taxonName>, and has the wing 66&ndash;79 mm.</p>
				<p>A rather long-winged race, colored like typical <taxonName idx_name="Melignothes exilis exilis">exilis</taxonName>, but with wings 73&ndash;82 mm. long, is <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Melignothes exilis pygm&aelig;us">M. e. pygm&aelig;us</taxonName> (Reichenow)</taxon>, ranging from Bukoba on Lake Victoria to western Kenya Colony and the Bahr-el-Ghazal Province. <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Melignothes exilis meliphilus">M. e. meliphilus</taxonName> Oberholser</taxon>, from the vicinity of Kilimanjaro and Usambara in East Africa, may well be a pale representative of this species; and <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Melignothes appelator">M. appelator</taxonName> (Vincent)</taxon><note n="1">1933, B. B. O. C., LIII, p. 130 (Zobue, Kirk Mts., Port E. Afr.).</note> must be a very close ally.</p>
				<p><taxonName idx_name="Melignothes exilis exilis">Melignothes e. exilis</taxonName> is not uncommon in the heavy forests of the Upper and Lower Congo, and has been found in adjacent gallery forests. It is a lowland bird, but ventures occasionally into the mountain forests; and on the western slope of Ruwenzori we collected a male at 6900 feet. Its wing measured 73 mm.</p>
				<p>In the forest region of the Ituri I often inquired of the natives whether they knew anything of honey-guides' habits, but always received negative answers.  I am convinced that none of the forest honey-guides leads mankind to the stores of bees, even though the pygmies are said to be so expert at collecting honey.  In addition to the ordinary honey-bees, there are other kinds in the Ituri, darker and smaller, which are said never to sting; and natives will even eat the honey of a still more minute black bee.</p>
				<p>At Avakubi I saw a party of three <taxonName>Melignothes exilis</taxonName> hopping about the boughs of some tall trees not far from a village.  Their flight was undulating, the white on the outer tail-feathers showing conspicuously. Several times I heard them give a short, dry, trilling note.  Our second specimen was taken by a hunter, in a tall tree left standing on a farm.</p>
				<p>The stomachs of both our specimens contained beeswax, as well as a few insect-remains and a seed.  To test the wax I melted it on a heated knife and allowed it to harden again.  I cannot explain how this species procures its honey-comb; but since it asks no aid of man I suspect it of having some other mammalian ally.</p>

				<p>This subspecies is believed to extend from the country just west of Lake Victoria to the Mabira forest in Uganda, the western border of Kenya Colony, and the Bahr-el-Ghazal Province.  We have examples with wings 75, 76, and 82 mm. from Sotik and Kakamega in Kenya Colony.  Even a specimen from northern Cameroon, with wing 77 mm., might be referred to the present form.  Sassi (1912) mentioned a male of <taxonName idx_name="Melignothes exilis exilis">exilis</taxonName> from the highland northwest of Lake Tanganyika as having the wing 79 mm. long, but three other specimens known from the same locality have wings only 71&ndash;73 mm., so I do not think the range of <taxonName idx_name="Melignothes exilis pygm&aelig;us">pygm&aelig;us</taxonName> extends to that region.  On the other hand, it is possible that representatives of this race may yet be found in Ruanda or on the northern border of the Uelle district.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;Cape Province to northern Angola, the southeastern Congo, East Africa, Abyssinia and Somaliland; and westward across the Sudan and northern Cameroon to Senegal.  Not in the heavy forests of West Africa, unless <taxonName idx_name="Melignothes conirostris">M. conirostris</taxonName> is to be regarded as conspecific.</p>
				<p><taxonName idx_name="Melignothes minor minor">Melignothes m. minor</taxonName> seems to range from the Cape north to the eastern base of Ruwenzori, the Manyema district, and Angola.  Its wing varies from 86 to 97 mm., in males usually exceeding 88.<note n="2">Roberts distinguishes specimens from countries north of Natal as <taxonName idx_name="Melignothes minor albigularis">M. m. albigularis</taxonName>.</note> <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Melignothes minor damarensis">M. m. damarensis</taxonName> Roberts</taxon> from Damaraland has the head grayer, breast more whitish, and wings a little shorter.  <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Melignothes minor teitensis">M. m. teitensis</taxonName> (Neumann)</taxon> is apparently confined to the coastlands of eastern Africa, and has wings 79&ndash;91 mm.  <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Melignothes minor diadematus">M. m. diadematus</taxonName> (R&uuml;ppell)</taxon> of Abyssinia and adjacent countries is darker brownish gray on crown and breast, with wings

				</p>
				<p>From the Semliki Valley and Bahr-el-Jebel west to northern Cameroon there is a race with more yellowish margins on back and wings, <taxonName idx_name="Melignothes minor riggenbachi">M. m. riggenbachi</taxonName>, with wings 85&ndash;95 mm.  <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Melignothes minor alexanderi">M. m. alexanderi</taxonName> (Grant)</taxon>, from the Gold Coast hinterland to Darfur, may be slightly lighter in color than <taxonName idx_name="Melignothes minor riggenbachi">riggenbachi</taxonName>.  The representative of the species in Senegambia is <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Melignothes minor senegalensis">M. m. senegalensis</taxonName> (Neumann)</taxon>, with upperparts like <taxonName idx_name="Melignothes minor teitensis">teitensis</taxonName>, but very pale beneath; wing about 85 mm. in males.</p>
				<p>In the Belgian Congo, birds which I refer only tentatively to <taxonName idx_name="Melignothes minor minor">M. m. minor</taxonName> are found in the Katanga, Marungu, and north to Kabalo on the Lualaba.  This same form probably extends to the country west of Lake Victoria and the eastern base of Ruwenzori.</p>
				<p>Near Elisabethville Schouteden took three examples, with wings 97 mm. in a male, and 90 for each of two females.  He also obtained a male at Kabalo with wing 94 mm.  Three specimens from Moba and Lake Suse in Marungu, collected by Rockefeller and Murphy, are lighter gray on crown, and less yellowish green on outer margins of secondaries than examples of <taxonName idx_name="Melignothes minor teitensis">teitensis</taxonName> from southeast Kenya Colony.  The wings of these Marungu birds measure 88&ndash;90 mm.  A male with wing 89 mm. was collected by the British Museum Expedition on the eastern slope of Ruwenzori, but others from the western base of the same range are more richly colored, and are referred to <taxonName idx_name="Melignothes minor riggenbachi">M. m. riggenbachi</taxonName>.</p>
				<p>The lesser honey-guide haunts patches of large trees or scrubby woods in savanna districts.  During about eight months of the year it calls persistently from a high perch, giving a series of toneless notes introduced by a drawling double note: &quot;pe-ew, pew,' pew,' pew'&mdash;.&quot;  The &quot;pew&quot; may be repeated as many as twenty-five times without pause.<note n="2">Moreau, 1937, Ibis, pp. 173, 174.</note>
				</p>
				<p>I have little confidence in statements that <taxonName>Melignothes minor</taxonName> shares the well-known guiding instinct of <taxonName>Indicator indicator</taxonName>.  In the case of Sir John Kirk&apos;s account of the honey-guide<note n="3">1864, Ibis, p. 327.</note> which he gave under the name &quot;<taxonName>Indicator minor</taxonName>&quot; I am firmly convinced that his observations really apply to <taxonName>Indicator indicator</taxonName>, and that they were placed under the name of the only species of the family he happened to have collected.  The same explanation may apply to the remarks by Marshall<note n="4">1900, Ibis, p. 251.</note> and by Lord Lovat<note n="5">1900, Ibis, p. 306.</note> as to this species guiding men to bee-hives.</p>
				<pb n="542" id="t000120-p00548c.tif"/>
				<p>R. H. Ivy, well versed in South African birds, gave testimony to the opposite effect: &quot;I have often watched this bird (<taxonName idx_name="Melignothes minor">M. minor</taxonName>) killing bees at a hive, but have never known it lead anyone to a nest of wild bees.&quot;<note n="1">1901, Ibis, p. 21.  In 1937 Mr. D. Townley wrote me however that he had observed &quot;guiding&quot;by <taxonName idx_name="Melignothes minor">M. minor</taxonName> twice, and by <taxonName idx_name="Indicator variegatus">I. variegatus</taxonName> just once, during a period of twelve years in Southern Rhodesia.</note> The same ornithologist tells of shooting a female of <taxonName idx_name="Melignothes minor">minor</taxonName>, with an egg protruding from the vent, as it tried to enter the nest of a barbet, <taxonName>Lybius torquatus</taxonName>, at Blue Krantz, Cape Province, in the month of October. Haagner and Ivy<note n="2">1907, Journ. S. Afr. Orn. Union, III, p. 103, Pl. IV.</note> figured an egg taken from a nest of the same barbet, and A. D. Millar is credited with finding one egg of the lesser honeyguide with four of this barbet&apos;s.  <taxonName>Pogoniulus pusillus</taxonName>, <taxonName>Dendropicos fuscescens</taxonName>, and a stripe-breasted swallow have also been reported as victims of <taxonName>Melignothes minor</taxonName>.  The white eggs of <taxonName idx_name="Melignothes minor">M. minor</taxonName> from South Africa are said to measure 20.3&ndash;22.3 mm. &times; 15.5&ndash;17.5.</p>

				<p>SPECIMEN.&mdash;Aba, &female;, July 17.</p>
				<p>ADULT FEMALE.&mdash;Iris dark brown, orbit dark gray; bill blackish, with base of mandible gray; feet greenish.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;From northern Cameroon and the Shari basin to the northern Uelle and Lado districts.  Perhaps also along the eastern edge of the Ituri forest, south to the base of Ruwenzori.  Here the plumage is unusually dark, and specimens seem almost intermediate between <taxonName idx_name="Melignothes minor riggenbachi">riggenbachi</taxonName> and <taxonName idx_name="Melignothes minor conirostris">conirostris</taxonName>.</p>
				<p>Our female from Aba came from the rocky hill called &quot;Libugu&quot; that marks the frontier on the road from Aba to Yei.  With another of its kind it was hopping silently about the boughs of some trees on the lower slope of the hill.  This specimen has been compared with the type of <taxonName idx_name="Melignothes minor riggenbachi">riggenbachi</taxonName> in the Berlin Museum, and despite a slightly shorter wing (85 mm.), agrees closely in coloration, including the extent of black on the outer rectrices.  It also resembles closely a female collected by Boyd Alexander at Bunda, on the Shari River.  At Mahagi Port Dr. Schouteden
<pb n="543" id="t000120-p00549c.tif"/> secured a male of <taxonName idx_name="Melignothes minor riggenbachi">riggenbachi</taxonName> with wing 91 mm., and two females with wings 85 and 87 mm.</p>
				<p>Reichenow stated that Emin&apos;s specimen from Karevia showed some resemblance to <taxonName idx_name="Melignothes minor conirostris">conirostris</taxonName> in the color of the back; and Count Zedlitz referred it to <taxonName idx_name="Melignothes minor riggenbachi">riggenbachi</taxonName>, while remarking that it was unusually dark below. Karevia is at the west base of Ruwenzori, near the Butahu River. Higher up in the valley of the Butahu, at 6800 feet, we secured a male of <taxonName idx_name="Melignothes minor conirostris">conirostris</taxonName>.  Near the new post of Beni, some 30 miles to the northwest of Karevia, we also collected two specimens which seem nearly intermediate in color between <taxonName idx_name="Melignothes minor conirostris">conirostris</taxonName> and <taxonName idx_name="Melignothes minor riggenbachi">riggenbachi</taxonName>.  Here they will be referred to <taxonName idx_name="Melignothes minor riggenbachi">riggenbachi</taxonName>, the adult male having the wing 89 mm., the young female 80.5 mm.  This undoubtedly lends support to the view that <taxonName idx_name="Melignothes minor minor">minor</taxonName> and <taxonName idx_name="Melignothes minor conirostris">conirostris</taxonName> belong to one species.</p>
				<p>The male from Beni was secured at the border of the lowland forest; and its stomach was well filled with bits of beeswax, mingled with fragments of insect-shells&mdash;probably not from bees.  The young female taken near Beni was in a small patch of woods about a spring, surrounded by grassland.  In its stomach were pulp and a few seeds from fruit, and many pieces of small insects.  None of these birds called or attempted to attract our attention in any way.</p>
				<p>A white egg taken from the oviduct by Dr. Schouteden at Mahagi Port on May 18 measures 21.5 &times; 16.8 mm.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;Forests of the Gold Coast Colony, Cameroon, Gaboon, Upper Congo, Ruwenzori, Mt. Elgon, and Kakamega in North Kavirondo.  <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Melignothes conirostris ussheri">M. c. ussheri</taxonName> (Sharpe)</taxon><note n="1">1902, B. B. O. C., XII, p. 80 (Fantee).</note> is usually regarded as the Upper Guinea representative.  Its crown and nape are dark olive green, like the back; wings 91&ndash;93 mm.  <taxonName idx_name="Melignothes conirostris conirostris">M. c. conirostris</taxonName> differs by its grayer head, only the nape with a greenish tinge, and by its grayer underparts; wings usually 79&ndash;96 mm.  This race is widely distributed in the Lower Guinea forest, from Mt. Cameroon and the Gaboon eastward to Ruwenzori.  I have never met with it in the Ituri forest, but the Congo Museum has an immature example from Buta, and I have collected two adults at Lukolela on the middle Congo.  Outside the solid forest area
<pb n="544" id="t000120-p00550c.tif"/> <taxonName idx_name="Melignothes conirostris conirostris">conirostris</taxonName> has been found by Bates at Tibati in the Cameroon highland, by Granvik on Mt. Elgon, and by Caldwell at Kakamega, Kenya Colony.</p>
				<p>The thick-billed honey-guide inhabits mountain forests as well as the lowlands.  We have a male from Kalongi, 6800 feet, on the west slope of Ruwenzori, which agrees well in color with Cameroon specimens, and has the wing 93 mm.  Even more surprising are Granvik&apos;s records of <taxonName idx_name="Melignothes conirostris conirostris">conirostris</taxonName> from Mt. Elgon,<note n="1">1923, J. f. O., Sonderheft, p. 85; 1934, Rev. Z.A., XXV, p. 50.</note> where he obtained a female with wing 90 mm. at 7000 feet, and later a male with wing 102 mm.  The American Museum has three specimens from Kakamega which I cannot distinguish from <taxonName idx_name="Melignothes conirostris conirostris">conirostris</taxonName>.  They were obtained from Captain Keith Caldwell. Two examples labeled as males have wings 92 and 93 mm.; the third, sexed as a female, has the wing 92 mm.  Dr. van Someren<note n="2">1922, Nov. Zool., XXIX, pp. 53, 54.</note> mentioned long-winged specimens of &quot;<taxonName idx_name="Melignothes conirostris teitensis">teitensis</taxonName>&quot; from Kakamega, and it would not be surprising if they were <taxonName idx_name="Melignothes conirostris conirostris">conirostris</taxonName>.</p>
				<p>At Lukolela on December 12, 1930, I visited a large dead tree occupied by a nesting colony of <taxonName>Gymnobucco bonapartei</taxonName>.  Several of these honey-guides were in the vicinity, and one even flew up and clung to the lower edge of a barbet doorway.  Of the two specimens of <taxonName idx_name="Melignothes conirostris">M. conirostris</taxonName> collected at that time one was a male with gonads slightly enlarged, the other a female with a soft egg in the oviduct.  The stomachs of both contained beeswax and bits of insects.  Nine weeks later the barbets were still busy at their nests, and one honey-guide was seen in a nearby tree.</p>
				<p>I have examined the young honey-guide of this species secured by Bates from a nest of <taxonName>Gymnobucco bonapartei</taxonName> at Bitye, Cameroon, on April 1.<note n="3">1909, Ibis, p. 16.</note> It is better feathered below than on its upperparts, though the wings are nearly half grown.  There is no reduction of inner primaries as in so many young woodpeckers.  Neither could I find a trace of an egg-tooth or any hooks on the beak.  The heel-pad is conspicuous, and bears rasp-like scales much as in a young barbet.  Another nestling believed to be of this species was found by Bates as the sole occupant of a nest-hole of <taxonName>Pogoniulus leucolaima</taxonName>.<note n="4">1911, Ibis, p. 503.</note> I should rather expect M. exilis to lay its egg in such a small nest.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;Eastern and southern Africa, from southern Abyssinia through Kenya Colony, Uganda, the southeastern Congo, and Angola to the Cape Province.  From southern Somaliland to Usambara there is a small race, <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Indicator variegatus jubaensis">I. v. jubaensis</taxonName> Neumann</taxon>,<note n="1">1908, B. B. O. C., XXI, p. 97 (Jonte, near Kismayu).</note> with wings 97&ndash;105 mm. long; elsewhere the wings measure 103&ndash;114 mm.  Long known in the Congo only from the vicinity of Kasindi and Beni, the typical race has now been found in the Katanga at Lukafu by G.F. de Witte.  John T. Zimmer also tells me that he collected a specimen at Katapena south of Lake Upemba; and Rockefeller and Murphy brought back two females from Kinia and Kampia in southern Marungu.</p>
				<p><taxonName>Indicator variegatus</taxonName> is so like a faded counterpart of <taxonName idx_name="Indicator maculatus">I. maculatus</taxonName> that it is not surprising that they were regarded as representative races by Zedlitz.<note n="2">1915, J. f. O., pp. 9, 10.</note>  The gap between them, in coloration, seems wide enough to be specific; and their choice of habitat is very different.</p>
				<p>The variegated honey-guide is usually found in patches of scrubby woods in savanna districts, and while largely a lowland bird it has been found up to 11,000 feet on Mt. Elgon.  It is said to have a chattering call like that of <taxonName idx_name="Indicator indicator">I. indicator</taxonName> and also a monotonous frog-like croaking or churring, uttered as it perches on some large tree.</p>
				<p>In South Africa <taxonName idx_name="Indicator variegatus variegatus">variegatus</taxonName> has been said to lead men to beehives. R.H. Ivy<note n="3">1901, Ibis, p. 21.</note> told of being guided thus six times, but perhaps always by the same bird.  Although he saw two adult and three immature birds, only one adult would lead him.</p>
				<p>A very young bird referred to this species by Haagner<note n="4">1907, Journ. S. Afr. Orn. Union, III, p. 3, Pl. I.</note> was found in the nest of <taxonName>Gymnoris superciliaris</taxonName> on November 12 in the Albany
<pb n="546" id="t000120-p00552c.tif"/> Division, Cape Province.  Probably not more than ten days old, it was still largely naked, and the extremity of the beak was furnished with a pair of strong, sharp hooks, one on the maxilla and one on the mandible. They measured 1.8 mm. in total length, and overlapped so as to take a sure hold&mdash;perhaps on the young of the fosterers, which were missing. &quot;These hooks are semi-transparent,&quot; wrote Haagner, &quot;and appear to be an exaggeration of the shell-breaking scale,&quot; or egg-tooth, of other birds.  They had an appearance of being welded to the tips of the mandibles.</p>
				<p>In Uganda Dr. van Someren<note n="1">1916, Ibis, p. 234.</note> reported eggs and a nestling taken from nests of <taxonName>Mesopicos goert&aelig;</taxonName> and <taxonName>Pogoniulus leucolaima</taxonName>.  Moreau<note n="2">1932, Ibis, p. 665.</note> in Usambara noted one young of this honey-guide being fed by <taxonName>Dendropicos fuscescens</taxonName>, and another by <taxonName>Mesopicos griseocephalus</taxonName>, side by side with a fledgling of the woodpecker.</p>

				<p>SPECIMENS.&mdash;Gamangui, &male;, Feb. 19; &female;, Feb. 8.</p>
				<p>ADULTS.&mdash;Iris dark brown, eyelids dusky olive; bill blackish, base of mandible slightly pinkish (&male;) or greenish brown (&female;); feet dark green.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;From the Gambia through Liberia to the forested Cameroon, Gaboon, and Upper Congo.  <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Indicator maculatus maculatus">I. m. maculatus</taxonName> Gray</taxon> occupies Upper Guinea; and <taxonName idx_name="Indicator maculatus stictithorax">I. m. stictithorax</taxonName> ranges from southern Cameroon (including Mt. Cameroon) and Gaboon<note n="3">The Philadelphia Academy has a specimen from the Ogow&eacute; River.</note> eastward through the heavy forests of Lower Guinea to the upper Kibali River and the eastern edge of the Ituri forest near the Semliki.  The southern limit is not known, but probably coincides with the edge of the unbroken forest.</p>
				<p>Besides comparing one of our Gamangui specimens with the type of <taxonName idx_name="Indicator maculatus stictithorax">stictithorax</taxonName> in Berlin, I have gone over the British Museum series with a
<pb n="547" id="t000120-p00553c.tif"/> view to understanding the status of <taxonName idx_name="Indicator maculatus maculatus">maculatus</taxonName>, <taxonName idx_name="Indicator maculatus fe&aelig;">fe&aelig;</taxonName>, and <taxonName idx_name="Indicator maculatus theres&aelig;">theres&aelig;</taxonName>.  I cannot see how Alexander&apos;s type of <taxonName idx_name="Indicator maculatus theres&aelig;">theres&aelig;</taxonName> differs from <taxonName idx_name="Indicator maculatus stictithorax">stictithorax</taxonName>; and if in Upper Guinea we try to distinguish <taxonName idx_name="Indicator maculatus de&aelig;">de&aelig;</taxonName> from <taxonName idx_name="Indicator maculatus maculatus">maculatus</taxonName> I fear we shall be separating young and adult of the same bird.  The only difference is that some birds (&quot;<taxonName idx_name="Indicator maculatus maculatus">maculatus</taxonName>&quot;) are more spotted on crown and cheeks, and the spots on their breasts stand out more clearly because of the duskier ground color.  Their rectrices are more pointed, and the whole plumage has an appearance of immaturity.  In Lower Guinea the same differences may be noted among the birds collected by Bates at Efulen and Bitye.  I feel satisfied that the difference is not specific, and that <taxonName idx_name="Indicator maculatus fe&aelig;">fe&aelig;</taxonName> is a synonym of <taxonName idx_name="Indicator maculatus maculatus">maculatus</taxonName>, as <taxonName idx_name="Indicator maculatus theres&aelig;">theres&aelig;</taxonName> is of <taxonName idx_name="Indicator maculatus stictithorax">stictithorax</taxonName>.</p>
				<p>The adult of the Upper Guinea bird, <taxonName idx_name="Indicator maculatus maculatus">I. m. maculatus</taxonName>, differs from <taxonName idx_name="Indicator maculatus stictithorax">I. m. stictithorax</taxonName> in being a little darker on the crown, with cheeks and malar region unstreaked, dark olive.  It has less yellow on the abdomen, and the light breast-spots do not stand out quite so clearly.  The length of wing and tail is about the same.</p>
				<p>Both our specimens from Gamangui were trapped by our native helpers, close to the ground in the heavy forest, the snares being baited with fragments of termite nests.  The stomachs of both contained remains of insects, and one had some sand in addition.  Neither was in breeding condition.  The wing of the male measures 104 mm., that of the female 101.  Before being skinned they emitted a peculiar musty odor, which adhered to their compact plumage after the skins were made up. Several of the other species of honey-guides share this characteristic odor.</p>
				<p>On October 10, 1926, we collected another female in non-breeding condition in the heavy forest near the new post of Beni.  It perched in the trees without calling or attempting to attract attention, and its stomach contained beeswax mixed with broken bits of insects.  This example has the wing 99 mm. long, and its underparts more brightly washed with yellow than those from Gamangui.  It shows no approach to <taxonName idx_name="Indicator variegatus">variegatus</taxonName>, although that species has been obtained no farther away than the upper Semliki Valley.</p>
				<p>Bates in the Cameroon shot four specimens near Efulen as they sat quietly in tree-tops near camp, in a forest clearing.  &quot;The stomach-contents of the birds were mainly particles of wax, mixed with bits of insects, and had a smell of honey; but sometimes there were only bits of insects.&quot;<note n="1">1909, Ibis, p. 16.</note>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;Throughout the Ethiopian Region, from Senegal, Darfur, and Eritrea to the Cape, with the exception of the West African lowland forests and the Eastern mountain forests.<note n="1">All recent investigators agree that there are no geographic races.  It is not even true, as Neumann claimed, that old birds from Angola always have dark bills.</note> Not migratory in the Congo, and known from all the savanna districts except the Lower Congo and the open plateau of the Kivu.  Close to the margin of the lowland forest it is apt to be rare or wanting, and we have only two specimens from the Kasai, taken in the vicinity of Luluabourg.  The Congo Museum has, however, a nestling from Lusambo.  I have seen it at Kasenyi on Lake Albert and in the Rutshuru Plain, but never on the wooded mountains of the eastern border.  In Marungu Rockefeller and Murphy took specimens up to 5600 feet, and Reichenow has recorded one example from the Rugege forest.  The Congo Museum has others
<pb n="549" id="t000120-p00555c.tif"/> from Tembwe on Lake Tanganyika, Kiambi on the Luvua, and Kinda in the Lulua district.</p>
				<p>In the Upper Uelle district we encountered it rather commonly throughout the savannas, and sometimes in small patches of woods near streams.  A party of four is the largest I have seen.  It is famous among the natives for its betrayal of beehives, and I was told that Azande chiefs would formerly have cut off the ear of any man who dared kill one of the &quot;Turubwa.&quot;  The Mangbetu call the honey-guide &quot;Natomb&eacute;.&quot; The services rendered by it to mankind have been known to Europeans ever since the publication of the travels of Father Jerome Lobo, who went to Abyssinia in 1629.</p>
				<p>Lang and I both had many chances to observe the extraordinary behavior of this honey-guide.  Its note, when it wishes to point out a bee colony, is a loud, excited, chattering noise which sound like &quot;cutta cutta cutta cutta&mdash;&quot; repeated very rapidly and over long periods as the bird moves ahead from tree to tree with fluttering flight.  When a native wishes to profit by the attentions of a honey-guide, he gives an occasional whistle, and walks after it.</p>
				<p>The following is an account of one of my own experiences: In a small wooded swamp near the post of Faradje, one afternoon in November, we came upon a male bird, who at once started his chattering, and flew off to some distance, returning shortly as though to assure himself that we were in earnest.  Replying with low whistles, we were led out onto higher ground, through the tall grass and scrub.  Now our feathered guide would fly noisily ahead some fifty yards till out of sight, perching on top of a bush, and repeating the performance as soon as we came up. Presently another male bird joined him.  We had gone about 600 yards when both birds stopped in a tree too small to harbor bees in its trunk. Yet by their short aimless flights and continual return to the tree, they showed us that this was the spot, and would allow us to walk up within 10 or 15 feet.  The buzzing of passing bees was now traced to a small hole in the ground close by.</p>
				<p>We prepared to make a fire, and our birds retired noiselessly for the time.  A little later I saw them again, sitting with puffed-out breasts and open bills, uttering a low &quot;chwee-r-r,&quot; which I had not heard before. They seemed to be quarreling, and one soon chased his rival off at top speed.  With the aid of some burning grass, two of my black helpers soon had the hive unearthed, paying a penalty of only six stings. The comb contained no honey, only pollen and bee larv&aelig;; the cavity in the ground had been excavated by termites.  A shower came up, so
<pb n="550" id="t000120-p00556c.tif"/> we placed some of the comb in the forks of a tree and departed.  An hour and a half later, we found that the birds had returned to peck at the comb; and the following morning I watched both birds, one after the other, come silently to seize a piece of the comb and fly off with it. This is the reward, beyond a doubt, for which the birds have worked, even though it may be wrong to credit them with the intelligence to foresee it.</p>
				<p>It is anything but unusual for honey-guides to secure honeycomb to eat.  In six of the eight stomachs we examined of <taxonName>Indicator indicator</taxonName> there was beeswax, and most of these birds had not led us to hives. Only four of the birds had been eating insects other than bee larv&aelig;: a few small unidentified insects in one case, a single beetle in the second, and termites in the two others.  On one occasion I saw a honey-guide, in company with some weavers, a drongo, and a woodpecker, catching termites in the air.  Its oesophagus and stomach were found to contain no less than 80 winged individuals of a medium-sized species.</p>
				<p>Most of the other African species of Indicatorid&aelig;, with the exception of <taxonName>Prodotiscus</taxonName>, also manage to eat honeycomb.  Wax is so often found in their stomachs that I believe it must resist digestion for some time, probably breaking up eventually in fine particles and passing down the intestine.  <taxonName idx_name="Indicator indicator">I. indicator</taxonName> is the only species which I have known to seek the assistance of man; but in South Africa <taxonName idx_name="Indicator variegatus">I. variegatus</taxonName> is said likewise to do so.  It has often been said that the honey badger (<taxonName>Mellivora</taxonName>) is guided like man by these birds; and I should be loath to abandon the" idea that many species of Indicatorid&aelig; get help in attacking hives from squirrels, monkeys, or other mammals.<note n="1">See also Seitz, 1923, Aus Natur und Museum, Frankfort a. M., LIII, p. 22.</note> They are so poorly adapted, themselves, for securing what we know is their usual food.  Should this instinct prove common to the whole group, it would furnish most valuable material for the study of avian behavior.</p>
				<p>I have known a honey-guide to accompany a hunting party on the road for a full half hour, trying to attract the men in some other direction by its frantic calls.  Not only the males act as guides to honey. Adult females give the same chattering call, and proffer their services in the same manner; but I have not seen young birds do so.</p>
				<p>In East Africa the blacks often relate that there is a chance of being led by the honey-guide to a lion or leopard.  This would seem to be mere accident, but Blayney Percival<note n="2">1924, `A Game Ranger&apos;s Note Book,' pp. 48&ndash;50.</note> vouches for one case in his own experience.</p>
				<pb n="551" id="t000120-p00557c.tif"/>
				<p>In October, 1912, I heard an unusual call from an adult male <taxonName>Indicator indicator</taxonName>, perching in a clump of trees at noon.  These sounds, which may correspond to the longer calls of some barbets, and represent a sort of song, were delivered with upraised beak, opening at each note.  Starting with a rather shrill &quot;ree,&quot; they soon changed to a double &quot;ree-chee,&quot; the second half rolling slightly, and were repeated about ten times.  At a hundred yards distance they sounded dry and tuneless, but close by had a more pleasant ring.  After each performance the bird rested three or four minutes, often preening his feathers.  I heard him repeat about six times; and immediately after he flew off he was mimicked by <taxonName>Cossypha niveicapilla</taxonName> in a nearby thicket.<note n="1">This call was also described by Swynnerton, 1908, Ibis, p. 411.  He wrote it &quot;tee-tree!&quot;</note>
				</p>
				<p>The breeding habits of the honey-guides resemble those of the parasitic cuckoos.  In South Africa <taxonName>Indicator indicator</taxonName> has been found to lay its white egg in the nests of <taxonName>Ph&oelig;niculus purpureus</taxonName>, <taxonName>Pogoniulus pusillus</taxonName>, <taxonName>Lybius torquatus</taxonName>, <taxonName idx_name="Campethera nubica">Campethera</taxonName> &quot;<taxonName idx_name="Campethera nubica">nubica</taxonName>,&quot; <taxonName>Dendropicos fuscescens</taxonName>, <taxonName>Monticola explorator</taxonName>, <taxonName>Hirundo cucullata</taxonName>, <taxonName>Hirundo albigularis</taxonName>, <taxonName>Dryoscopus cubla</taxonName>, <taxonName>Parus niger</taxonName>, <taxonName>Spreo bicolor</taxonName>, <taxonName>Passer melanurus</taxonName>, and a drongo.  Much information on the subject will be found in notes by Messrs. Haagner and Ivy, in the Ibis, 1901, pp. 20, 21; Journ. S. Afr. Orn. Union, 1907, III, pp. 1&ndash;5, 103;" idem, 1911, VII, p. 79.  Both names used by these authors, <taxonName idx_name="Indicator sparrmani">sparrmani</taxonName> and <taxonName idx_name="Indicator major">major</taxonName>, are simply synonyms of <taxonName idx_name="Indicator indicator">indicator</taxonName>.<note n="2">Credit for recognizing <taxon><taxonName>Indicator major</taxonName> Stephens</taxon> as the young of <taxonName idx_name="Indicator indicator">I. indicator</taxonName> goes to Boyd Alexander (1908, B. B. O. C., XXI, p. 91).</note> The olive-backed juvenal plumage, with yellowish throat, is surprisingly different from that of adults.  A black throat distinguishes the adult male.</p>
				<p>The egg of <taxonName idx_name="Indicator indicator">I. indicator</taxonName> is described as of regular &quot;oval&quot; shape, plain creamy white with a mere tinge of lavender-buff, 24.5&ndash;25 mm. &times; 18&ndash;19.5.  It seems &quot;that all the honey-guides break the eggs of the foster parent to make room for their own, wherever possible.&quot;  The nestling of the present species<note n="3">Haagner, 1911, Journ. S. Afr. Orn. Union, VII, p. 79.</note> has curved hooks on the tips of both upper and lower mandibles, which are sometimes retained until it is fully fledged and ready to fly.  It has been supposed that the hooks could be used to eject other young birds from the nest, if necessary.  None of the fosterers of this species in tropical Africa are known, except that in Kenya Colony Dr. van Someren<note n="4">1916, Ibis, p. 238.</note> reported finding one egg in the nest of <taxonName>Pogoniulus bilineatus</taxonName>.  Larger barbets and woodpeckers are likely to prove the usual victims.</p>
				<p>From dissections of our series taken in the Uelle district it is apparent
<pb n="552" id="t000120-p00558c.tif"/> that breeding is carried on there from January to April, whereas no bird ready to breed was found during the remainder of the year. From Luluabourg in the Kasai district we have a young bird with wings and tail not fully grown, taken by Father Callewaert on August 29. It strengthens my belief that in the Congo <taxonName>Indicator indicator</taxonName> is a dry-season breeder.<note n="1">See Erlanger, 1905, J. F. O., p. 467.</note> This young bird has no longer any trace of hooks on the beak, but does show the heel-pad with tubercles (not so well developed as in young barbets), described by Gyldenstolpe.<note n="2">1917, Arkiv f.

				<p>SPECIMEN.&mdash;Avakubi, &male;, Apr. 17.</p>
				<p>ADULT MALE.&mdash;Iris bright brown, eyelids grayish brown; bill dusky brown; feet dull grayish green.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;Lowland forests of the Cameroon, eastward across the Congo to the Upper Ituri, where it must be expected to reach the Semliki Valley.  Dum&eacute;, whence came von Sommerfeld&apos;s specimen, is 110 miles northeast of Bitye.</p>
				<p>Bates&apos;s type-specimen had the tail-feathers so badly worn and broken that their remarkable form was hardly apparent.  Reichenow&apos;s type of <taxonName idx_name="Melichneutes sommerfeldi">sommerfeldi</taxonName> was a young bird, with the dusky breast of the juvenal plumage; and while its tail resembles that of the adult to a considerable degree, still he failed to describe or figure it adequately.<note n="3">Reichenow, 1910, O. Mb., p. 160; 1914, `Die V&ouml;gel,' II, p. 61.</note> This is how I came to apply a third name to the species.</p>
				<p>The unusual difference between adult and young is well illustrated by an example scarcely ready to leave the nest, collected at Medje in the Ituri district by Dr. Christy, and now in the Congo Museum.  Its crown and cheeks are sooty, wings dusky with olive-green edgings, back and rump more greenish than crown.  The underparts are dark grayish olive, washed over with blackish; abdomen and tail-coverts (save the longest) lighter and greener.  The tail-feathers, though only half-grown, are colored much as in the adult, and the middle ones curve outward slightly.</p>
				<pb n="553" id="t000120-p00559c.tif"/>
				<p>The beak, which interested me greatly because of the hooks it is said to carry in the young of <taxonName>Indicator</taxonName>, is largely blackish, with a small white egg-tooth at the tip of the maxilla.  This shows no sign of having been a hook, and the mandible bears no egg-tooth at all.  In the wing the growing inner primaries show no sign of the reduction so common in young woodpeckers.  The heel-pad is well developed, with pointed conic scales, as in young barbets.</p>
				<p>This bird furnishes the final proof that <taxonName idx_name="Melichneutes sommerfeldi">sommerfeldi</taxonName> is the young of <taxonName idx_name="Melichneutes robustus">robustus</taxonName>.  Bates&apos;s type, in fact, shows a few scattered blackish feathers
<figure>
						<figDesc>Fig. 37.  <taxonName>Melichneutes robustus</taxonName>. &times; 2/3, approximately.</figDesc>
					</figure>  from the juvenal plumage on the middle of the breast.  There are no marked differences between the sexes.  A second female secured by Mr. Bates at Bitye has a lyrate tail like that of our male, but the long dark under tail-coverts do not reach within 9 mm. of the tip of the median rectrices.</p>
				<p>My measurements of the three known specimens which are approximately adult are: wing, &male;, 95 mm., &female;, 96, 94; tail, &male;, 56, &female;, 51, 53; exposed culmen, &male;, 13.5, &female; 12.5.  In general the form of bill and nostrils is similar to that of <taxonName>Indicator indicator</taxonName>, but slightly stouter.</p>
				<pb n="554" id="t000120-p00560u.tif"/>
				<p>The lyre-tailed honey-guide is perhaps a common bird of the forest tree-tops, but very difficult to observe.  Walking along a forest path near Avakubi, I was puzzled by a strange harsh note from the top of a tree, and following it up perceived a dull-colored bird with a tail that condemned it at once to death.  But there happened to be a second individual, which flew away, and as my helper, Nekuma, started in pursuit we heard a curious note, over which we had long speculated.  It seemed to be coming toward us, and suddenly ceased.  Looking in that direction, we found our bird perched in a tall tree.  It flew back to the tree where its companion had been shot, gave the shorter note we had first heard, somewhat like the chatter of <taxonName>Indicator indicator</taxonName> but slower, and then escaped before we could secure it.</p>
				<p>The note which apparently was made on the wing interested us particularly, because I had heard it in the Ituri forest nearly four years before, and many times during 1913 and 1914, at Medje, Pawa, and Avakubi.  It is very loud, audible seemingly for a quarter of a mile, and might be written &quot;nyet&eacute;!  nyet&eacute;! nyet&eacute;!  nyet&eacute;!&mdash;&quot;  It is usually repeated a dozen or more times, starting faintly, but swelling in volume, with a peculiar resonant metallic quality, then falling slightly and stopping. Or perhaps it will be continued, rising again and falling in the same way, until sometimes it has been reiterated thirty times.  We used to hear this call in the Ituri throughout a large part of the year, except in the months of May and June.  It is well known to the natives, and they are unanimous in the opinion that it is made by a small bird in flight, called by the Azande of the wooded Bomakandi district, for example, &quot;Ny&ebreve;t&eacute;.&quot;  Some say it is a woodpecker, but none seems really to know.  After following the noise unsuccessfully, I too had come to the conclusion that the maker was flying high in the air, above the forest trees.  Now that I feel so sure it must be the lyre-tailed honey-guide, the peculiar structure of its tail makes me wonder whether the narrowed rectrices have not something to do with the note, as they do in snipe.</p>
				<p>On November 7, 1926, I again heard this unmistakable note in the forest of the Semliki Valley, near Mushinene.  All efforts to see the maker were vain, it seemed to be high over the tree-tops.  One of my black companions said that the bird was known as &quot;Anz&egrave;ba&quot; among the Wambuba, a tribe living in the vicinity.  At Lukolela, where I spent eight months in 1930 and 1931, I never heard the sound, although my native helpers when questioned said that they were familiar with it.</p>
				<p>It may take many more years to discover the breeding habits of this bird.  Dr. Christy&apos;s specimen was probably secured by natives, thinks
<pb n="555" id="t000120-p00561c.tif"/> Lang, who was with him at Medje at the time.  There is a great likelihood that it came from a nest of <taxonName>Gymnobucco</taxonName>.</p>
				<p>The stomach of our adult bird was filled with beeswax, mixed with small bits of insects, showing that it shares the tastes of its better-known relatives.  Bates likewise found flakes of wax in the stomach of his first specimen.<note n="1">1911, Ibis, p. 505.</note> I do not hesitate to predict that the habits of this bird, when better known, will be of extreme interest.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;From southern England to eastern Siberia, Japan, and China.  Five or six races are recognized, one of them breeding in northern Algeria.  The typical race nests in Europe and western Asia, migrating south in winter to India and the Ethiopian Region, where it has been met with as far south as the Gold Coast, Cameroon, northern Uganda, and Somaliland.</p>
				<p>Dr. Christy collected a specimen at Yei, close to the Congo-Lado border, in November.  Dybowski&apos;s specimen, which Reichenow attributed to the Ubangi River, was reported by Oustalet without giving any exact locality; but Dybowski himself mentioned it as occurring near Bangui.  Dr. Schouteden obtained an example south of Doruma in the Uelle district, so the European wryneck may be looked for, during the northern winter, all along the northern border of the Belgian Congo.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;From eastern Cape Province north to the Loango Coast, Lake Kivu, East Africa, and Wogara in Abyssinia; also the Bahr-el-Jebel, Ubangi district, and savannas of Cameroon. Not in heavy forest of Congo or Cameroon.</p>
				<p><taxonName idx_name="Jynx ruficollis ruficollis">J. r. ruficollis</taxonName>, the South African race, ranges north to Landana, the Alima River, the Katanga, and the bases of the Kivu Volcanoes.  <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Jynx ruficollis cosensi">J. r. cosensi</taxonName> Grant</taxon><note n="1">1915, B. B. O. C., XXXV, p. 102 (Amala R., E. Africa).</note> of East Africa, north to Mt. Elgon, differs from the typical form only by a slightly longer wing (94&ndash;101 mm.).  The wings of the South African birds measure 90&ndash;95 mm., those of six skins from the Kivu district 91&ndash;95 mm.  The range of typical <taxonName idx_name="Jynx ruficollis ruficollis">ruficollis</taxonName> seems therefore to extend to the Kivu district, and perhaps to Lake Victoria.  A bird from Dilolo however is longer-winged, 99 mm.</p>
				<p><taxon><taxonName idx_name="Jynx ruficollis &aelig;quatorialis">J. r. &aelig;quatorialis</taxonName> R&uuml;ppell</taxon> of Abyssinia is distinguished by the greater extension of the rufous chest-color on the breast.  In <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Jynx ruficollis pulchricollis">J. r. pulchricollis</taxonName> Hartlaub</taxon>, on the other hand, the rufous is wholly restricted to chest and fore-neck, the throat being barred with black and white.  This form ranges from the region of the Bahr-el-Jebel and Lake Albert west to Bozum in French Equatorial Africa, being replaced in Cameroon by <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Jynx ruficollis thorbeckei">I. r. thorbeckei</taxonName> Reichenow</taxon>, with throat similarly barred, but rufous gorget less elongate, and underparts more buffy.</p>
				<p>Within our territory <taxonName idx_name="Jynx ruficollis ruficollis">Jynx r. ruficollis</taxonName> appears to be not very common in the Lower Congo, and as yet unknown in the savannas of the Kasai. One example in the Paris Museum was obtained by de Brazza at Leketi on the Alima River, French Congo.  In the Katanga it is probably more common than the single published record would indicate, and de Witte secured a specimen at Dilolo.</p>
				<p>In the highlands of the Kivu district <taxonName idx_name="Jynx ruficollis ruficollis">ruficollis</taxonName> is not uncommon.  In addition to the specimens collected by Pilette and Schouteden I have taken a female six miles north of Kibati (6600 ft.) on July 1, and a male
<pb n="557" id="t000120-p00563c.tif"/> in British Ruanda near Lake Bunyoni on April 8.  Although neither individual was in breeding condition, it does not seem likely that they were migrants from the south.  G.F. de Witte also obtained specimens at Munagana and Lake Bulero.  This race may even reach the southern extremity of Ruwenzori.</p>
				<p>Despite its relation to the woodpeckers, this wryneck does not resemble them superficially in life.  At first view it always seemed to me a nondescript brown bird with a flight like a passerine bird&apos;s, which might be seen perching on a bough of a tree, or flying up unexpectedly from some bare patch of ground.  Not until I put the field glass on it would its" identity become clear.  As with the European species, the dark stripe running down the back of the neck was then conspicuous.</p>
				<p>Ants and their pup&aelig; seem to provide the bulk of their food.  They have extensile tongues with long hyoids and very large salivary glands; but the hard tip of the tongue is without barbs.</p>
				<p>The nest, as described from Natal, is an excavation in a tree-trunk, some 10 feet above the ground, containing four eggs.  These are white, well glossed, elongate-oval, and measure 20.5&ndash;24 mm. &times; 17&ndash;17.3. Nesting dates in Natal are in August and October.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;From Babira, east of the Bahr-el-Jebel, southward to Buguera, west of Lake Albert, and westward to the upper Kemo River and Bozum in French Equatorial Africa.<note n="1">Berlioz, 1934, Bull. Mus. Paris, (2) VI, pp. 230, 231.</note> The record from Buguera is authentic, for Dr. Stresemann writes me that there are two specimens, male and female, in the Berlin collection, which were collected by Emin at Buguera on March 7 and 13, 1889.  This locality appears to be close to the Bogoro of our day, a village on a grassy plateau overlooking Lake Albert, and a likely spot for such a bird.  A young wryneck obtained by Stuhlmann in Ihangiro, west of Lake Victoria, is <taxonName idx_name="Jynx ruficollis ruficollis">ruficollis</taxonName>, not <taxonName idx_name="Jynx ruficollis pulchricollis">pulchricollis</taxonName>.<note n="2">See Hesse, 1912, Mitt. Zool. Mus. Berlin, VI, p. 145.</note> Dr. Stresemann assures me that the rusty color of its throat extends right up to the chin.</p>
				<p>I believe that <taxonName idx_name="Jynx ruficollis pulchricollis">pulchricollis</taxonName> is found also in the savannas of the Ubangi
<pb n="558" id="t000120-p00564c.tif"/> district, for Dybowski&apos;s specimen from the upper Kemo River was thus" identified by Berlioz, and in the Hamburg Museum I saw a wryneck collected by the Second Mecklenburg Expedition at Duma in Belgian territory. This skin had been labeled as <taxonName idx_name="Jynx ruficollis pulchricollis">pulchricollis</taxonName> by Professor Reichenow.  It seems a little strange that this wryneck has not yet been observed in the savannas of the Uelle, but it does occur in the southern Bahr-el-Ghazal province.</p>
				<p>While I never found it on the Lendu Plateau, I did see a rufouschested wryneck in the open acacia woods of the Lubilia Valley, just north of Lake Edward, on January 30, 1927.  It made its escape, so whether it was <taxonName idx_name="Jynx ruficollis pulchricollis">pulchricollis</taxonName> or <taxonName idx_name="Jynx ruficollis ruficollis">ruficollis</taxonName> must remain an open question.</p>
				<p>Emin noted that the note of the male of <taxonName idx_name="Jynx ruficollis pulchricollis">pulchricollis</taxonName> was a repeated &quot;dii-i,&quot; which was answered by his mate.  In rising from the ground they uttered a sharp &quot;zick.&quot;  Nesting probably takes place in the dry season.</p>

				<p>IMMATURE.&mdash;Skin of face purplish red, iris light brown; feet dirty pink.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;Southern Cameroon, Gaboon, and the whole Congo forest east to the Upper Ituri and south to Kabambaie and Luluabourg in the Kasai district.  The Frankfort Museum has a specimen secured by Schubotz at Angu on the Uelle River.  Although Bannerman reported
<pb n="559" id="t000120-p00565c.tif"/> this piculet as nesting at Lokodja, Nigeria, I still am skeptical of Shuel&apos;s sight" identification.  The measurements of the egg he collected seem too large.<note n="1">See Jourdain and Shuel, 1935, Ibis, p. 644.</note>
				</p>
				<p>My first examination of <taxonName>Verreauxia</taxonName> in the flesh impressed me, as it did Verreaux, with a certain external resemblance to <taxonName>Pogoniulus</taxonName>, especially
<figure>
						<figDesc>Fig. 38.  <taxonName>Verreauxia africana</taxonName>. &times;  3/4.</figDesc>
					</figure>  in the light lines on the side of the head and the bristles at the base of the bill.  The tongue however is barbed (about six barbs on each side) and extensile, with well-developed salivary glands; but the &quot;horns&quot; of the hyoid are not very long, their tips reaching only to a point above the posterior edges of the eyeballs.  The upper walls of the brain-case
<pb n="560" id="t000120-p00566u.tif"/> are not entirely composed of a single strong layer of bone, as in the true woodpeckers, but are invaded posteriorly by the diplo&euml;, so while the frontal region remains almost transparent, the parietal region has little rods of bone connecting the two layers, and producing a speckled appearance. This feature of the skull is barbet-like.  As W. DeW. Miller<note n="1">1924, Bull. A. M. N. H., L, pp. 320, 321.</note> has shown, the rectrices of <taxonName>Verreauxia</taxonName> are only eight in number.</p>
				<p>In their first plumage the young have a heavy wash of cinnamon on the whole underparts; and the young males show at an early age a rufous frontal patch which distinguishes them from the females, and becomes more prominent with the adult plumage.</p>
				<p>Though so distinctly a bird of the forest districts, the African piculet prefers old tangled second-growth woods to the more open virgin forest. There the tiny birds are found in twos or threes living more or less in woodpecker fashion, often within two or three yards of the ground, hopping and flitting silently from bush to bush, and clinging also to the smooth upright stalks of phryniums.  The transverse ridges on the under sides of their toes must be of use in maintaining a hold on such slippery plants; and in the Oriental piculets of the genus <taxonName>Sasia</taxonName> they are even better developed, recalling in <taxonName idx_name="Sasia ochracea">S. ochracea</taxonName> the pads beneath geckos&apos;s toes.</p>
				<p>Sometimes I found <taxonName>Verreauxia</taxonName> in the company of forest bird-parties; but the specimen from Stanleyville was taken as it climbed on a small tree in a patch of tall grass.  They differ widely from the small woodpeckers of the region in eating no ants, but mainly wood-boring beetlelarv&aelig;. Nine of the ten stomachs examined contained such soft larv&aelig;, up to ten in number.  The one remaining bird, still immature, had eaten a small beetle and other insects.  I have seen a piculet hammering vigorously on a small tree, and Bates<note n="2">1909, Ibis, p. 19; 1930, `Handbook Birds W. Afr.,' p. 283.</note> relates that their food is usually pecked from the heart of a stalk of a common marantaceous plant, <taxonName>Trachy phrynium</taxonName>.  Bates also found the nest, in the dry end of a small stump, with a round entrance-hole only 20 mm. in diameter.  The two small white eggs, being incubated by the male, measured 14 &times; 12 and 13.5 &times; 11.5 mm.</p>
				<p>None of our specimens of <taxonName>Verreauxia</taxonName> was in breeding condition&mdash; from late October to March&mdash;and from the occurrence of fully fledged young birds at that time, I concluded that the breeding period in the Ituri falls in the middle of the rainy season, and ends towards September
<pb n="561" id="t000120-p00567c.tif"/> or October.  Bates is said to have found in the Cameroon that the dry season was preferred for nesting.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;Darfur and northern Abyssinia, south through East Africa and the savannas of the eastern Congo border to the Boror district of Portuguese East Africa.  In the Congo it occurs only in the savannas of the eastern border, from Lake Albert to Rutshuru. B&ouml;hm&apos;s sight records of <taxonName idx_name="Campethera nubica nubica">nubica</taxonName> in Marungu must refer to <taxonName idx_name="Campethera bennettii">C. bennettii</taxonName>.</p>
				<p><taxonName idx_name="Campethera nubica nubica">Campethera n. nubica</taxonName>, the form which reaches these Congo areas, ranges from the Sudan and Abyssinia to Uganda, the northern Kivu district, and northern Tanganyika Territory.  There is still some dispute as to the validity of <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Campethera nubica neumanni">C. n. neumanni</taxonName> (Reichenow)</taxon> from the highlands of Kenya Colony, which may be more heavily spotted beneath.  <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Campethera nubica pallida">C. n. pallida</taxonName> (Sharpe)</taxon>, from Gallaland and Somaliland south to Morogoro in Tanganyika Territory, is lightly spotted below and has more whitish barring above.  <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Campethera nubica scriptoricauda">C. n. scriptoricauda</taxonName> (Reichenow)</taxon> occupies the coastal area of eastern Africa from Kenya Colony south to Nyasaland and Portuguese East Africa.  It is distinguished by the black spotting on throat as well as chest, tail-quills tipped with black, and lower mandible yellowish.<note n="1">See W.L. Sclater, 1925, B. B. O. C., XLVI, p. 14.  Dr. van Someren (1922, Nov. Zool., XXIX, p. 63; 1932," idem, XXXVII, p. 282) regards <taxonName idx_name="Campethera nubica scriptoricauda">scriptoricauda</taxonName> as a distinct species.</note>
				</p>
				<p>In the eastern Congo <taxonName idx_name="Campethera nubica nubica">C. n. nubica</taxonName> inhabits the savannas in the floor of the Albertine Rift, not only the drier parts with open acacias, but even spots in the Semliki Valley where there is a dense growth of elephant grass.  I have seen it at Kasenyi on Lake Albert, at the south-west base of Ruwenzori, near Kasindi, and on the Rutshuru Plain.  It does not ascend the slopes of Ruwenzori, above 5000 feet.</p>
				<pb n="563" id="t000120-p00569c.tif"/>
				<p>Its food consists almost entirely of ants, caught on the trunks and limbs of trees; and both in behavior and voice it is closely similar to <taxonName idx_name="Campethera punctuligera balia">C. punctuligera balia</taxonName>.  Its shrill metallic note sounds to me like a reiteration of &quot;kring-kring-kring&mdash;,&quot; increasing in rapidity and then dying out.  The iris of <taxonName idx_name="Campethera nubica nubica">nubica</taxonName> is light rosy red, as it is in <taxonName idx_name="Campethera punctuligera balia">balia</taxonName>.</p>
				<p>A nest, found at Nganzi&apos;s in the Semliki Valley on February 5, was excavated in an old rotten stump of an <taxonName>Erythrina</taxonName> tree, about 7 feet from the ground.  The male was incubating, whereas it was the female that we found in a nest in the Kidong Valley, Kenya Colony, on June 6. In the latter case a natural cavity in the trunk of an ant-acacia served as the nest, only the entrance having been enlarged by the birds.  Two white eggs are normally laid, measuring about 25 &times; 18.5 mm.</p>

				<p>SPECIMENS.&mdash;Niangara, &male; juv., &female; juv., Jan. 1.  Dungu, &male;, June 3.  Faradje, 6 &male;, Feb. 23, 27, Apr. 2, May 12, Oct. 18, 25; 3 &female;, Oct. 14, 25, Nov. 13; 4 &female; juv., Feb. 27, Apr. 2.</p>
				<p>ADULT MALE.&mdash;Iris light rose-red; maxilla black, mandible dark bluish gray with black tip; feet dark greenish gray.</p>

				<p>NESTLING.&mdash;Iris dark brownish gray; bill dark gray, with egg-tooth and gape-swellings white; feet light blue-gray.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;From Senegal to Northern Nigeria, the Bahr-el-Ghazal, and the eastern Uelle district.  <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Campethera punctuligera punctuligera">C.p. punctuligera</taxonName> (Wagler)</taxon> ranges from Senegal east to the Gold Coast hinterland, Northern Nigeria, and the Niger Delta.  <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Campethera punctuligera batesi">C.p. batesi</taxonName> Bannerman</taxon>, with much more heavily spotted throat and chest, is supposed to occupy northern Cameroon (Ngaundere and Bozum).  <taxonName idx_name="Campethera punctuligera balia">C.p. balia</taxonName> is distributed from
<pb n="564" id="t000120-p00570c.tif"/> the country south of Lake Chad and the great bend of the Ubangi eastward to the Bahr-el-Ghazal and the Upper Uelle district.  It is less heavily spotted below than <taxonName idx_name="Campethera punctuligera batesi">batesi</taxonName>, but more so than typical <taxonName idx_name="Campethera punctuligera punctuligera">punctuligera</taxonName>, from which it differs especially in the shape of the white markings of the fore-crown in the female.  In <taxonName idx_name="Campethera punctuligera balia">balia</taxonName> these are round, in <taxonName idx_name="Campethera punctuligera punctuligera">punctuligera</taxonName> elongated almost to streaks.  The female specimen collected by Dybowski in the &quot;Pays des Ouaddahs&quot; near the Ubangi River has the white crown spots slightly elongated, and thus seems to be intermediate between these two races.  One aberrant male of <taxonName idx_name="Campethera punctuligera balia">balia</taxonName> from Faradje has no spots on throast or breast, only at sides of chest, and the black post-ocular line is barely indicated.</p>
				<p>The <taxonName idx_name="Campethera punctuligera">punctuligera</taxonName> group is so closely allied to the <taxonName idx_name="Campethera nubica">nubica</taxonName> group that they are almost certain to be treated as races of one species by the adherents of the Formenkreis-theory.  Their ranges indeed seem to be complementary.  <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Campethera notata">C. notata</taxonName> (Lichtenstein)</taxon> of South Africa is rather closely allied, whereas <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Campethera bennettii">C. bennettii</taxonName> (Smith)</taxon> shows a striking difference in the coloration of the cheeks and throat of the female.</p>
				<p>In the Upper Uelle we found <taxonName idx_name="Campethera punctuligera balia">balia</taxonName> rather common among the trees that dot the grassland, in pairs or family parties not exceeding four. The call, apparently given by males only, is a shrill metallic &quot;kweeyer,&quot; repeated again and again, which sounded to me as though it ought rather to come from a kestrel.  Lang often said it reminded him of the voice of the European wryneck.</p>
				<p>We did not find the nest ourselves, but had six young brought to us by natives, from January to April.  Broods were of two or three. Together with dissections of adults, this evidence shows there is a definite breeding season from early November to early April.</p>
				<p>Small ants furnish the greater part of the food, and were present (with larv&aelig; twice included) in 7 of the 8 adult stomachs we examined, sometimes filling them.  In two cases we found small termites (not winged).  In the stomachs of two nestlings there was a mixture of termites and ants.  These ants must have been taken on tree-trunks, for never in the Congo did I see a woodpecker visit the ground.  Yet this species is the one most likely of all to feed there occasionally.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;Zululand and the Transvaal to northern Angola, Katanga, Urundi, and the southern shore of Lake Victoria.  <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Campethera bennettii bennettii">C. b. bennettii</taxonName> (Smith)</taxon> ranges from Zululand to Southern Rhodesia; and it is replaced in Damaraland and southern Angola by <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Campethera bennettii capricorni">C. b. capricorni</taxonName> Strickland</taxon>, with chest much more finely spotted, and throat and ear-coverts of female black instead of brown.  <taxonName idx_name="Campethera bennettii uniamwesica">C. b. uniamwesica</taxonName> differs from the typical race in being less distinctly barred, as a rule, on back and rectrices.  Throat and ear-coverts of the female are lighter chestnut-brown.  Its range extends from the vicinity of Lake Victoria across the southeastern Congo to Northern Rhodesia and northern Angola.</p>
				<p>Pilette collected it at Mawagongo west of Baraka, Schouteden at Kabalo.  In Marungu Rockefeller and Murphy secured three specimens at Kasoko, Kinia, and Selembe, all between 3600 and 4100 feet. They noted the iris of two males as maroon and pink, of a female as dark brown.  The sight records of <taxonName idx_name="Campethera nubica">C. nubica</taxonName> by B&ouml;hm in Marungu must really refer to <taxonName idx_name="Campethera bennettii">C. bennettii</taxonName>.  Other examples in the Congo Museum are from Kiambi, Lukafu, Nieuwdorp, Kapiri, and Lake Musolo.  In the Katanga this woodpecker seems to be fairly common, and Admiral Lynes finds that his specimens from that district are intermediate between <taxonName idx_name="Campethera bennettii uniamwesica">uniamwesica</taxonName> and <taxonName idx_name="Campethera bennettii bennettii">bennettii</taxonName>.  In the Kasai district the species has not been observed.</p>
				<p>According to Austin Roberts it gives &quot;loud, deep, bell-like notes&quot; such as one would never expect from a woodpecker.</p>
				<p>The Marungu birds were in non-breeding condition in March and April, while in the southeastern Katanga late in October, Mouritz found
<pb n="566" id="t000120-p00572c.tif"/> a nest attributed to this species, with two nestlings.  It was a hole in a tree only five feet from the ground.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;From Natal and Damaraland north to the Juba River, the Bahr-el-Ghazal, and westward to Senegal; but not in the forested areas of western and central Africa.</p>
				<p>Eight races are probably to be recognized, of which two occur in savanna districts of the Congo.  <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Campethera abingoni abingoni">C. a. abingoni</taxonName> (Smith)</taxon> ranges from Natal and eastern Rhodesia to southern Nyasaland.  It has a yellowish-white throat with little or no spotting.  <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Campethera abingoni smithi">C. a. smithi</taxonName> (Malherbe)</taxon> of the Transvaal and Bechuanaland has the blackest throat of all the forms. <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Campethera abingoni anderssoni">C. a. anderssoni</taxonName> (Roberts)</taxon><note n="1">1936, Ann. Transvaal Mus., XVIII, p. 255 (Windhuck).</note> of Southwest Africa is stated to have the throat more spotted or striped with white on a black ground.  <taxonName idx_name="Campethera abingoni annectens">C. a. annectens</taxonName> likewise has the middle of throat blackish, spotted with whitish, the chest heavily streaked with black.  Wings 111&ndash;127 mm., exposed culmen 26&ndash;28.  It extends from Benguella to the grasslands of the Gaboon, and eastward to Lake Nyasa and the Kivu district.  <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Campethera abingoni suahelica">C. a. suahelica</taxonName> (Reichenow)</taxon> occupies northern Tanganyika Territory, <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Campethera abingoni mombassica">C. a. mombassica</taxonName> (Fischer and Reichenow)</taxon> the eastern coast from Mombasa to the Juba River.  <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Campethera abingoni kavirondensis">C. a. kavirondensis</taxonName> van Someren</taxon><note n="2">1926, B. B. O. C., XLVII, p. 70 (Lolgorien, S. Kavirondo).</note> is known only from southern Kavirondo to the Amala River, while <taxonName idx_name="Campethera abingoni chrysura">C. a. chrysura</taxonName> ranges from the Lado district and Bahr-el-Ghazal to Senegal.  The last named race is short-billed, exposed culmen 21&ndash;24 mm., its wing 105&ndash;113 mm., and throat with relatively little black.</p>
				<p><taxonName idx_name="Campethera abingoni annectens">Campethera a. annectens</taxonName> is not a very common woodpecker in the southern Congo, and is not yet known from the Kasai district.  It has
<pb n="567" id="t000120-p00573c.tif"/> been found near Stanley Pool and the cataracts, and the Congo Museum has specimens from Funda Biabo, Kapiri, Nieuwdorp, and Tembwe, in addition to the published records.  I have collected one at Luvungi in the Ruzizi Valley.  Dr. van Someren<note n="1">1922, Nov. Zool., XXIX, p. 63.</note> called attention to the small size of specimens from the vicinity of Baraka, but those of northern Angola and the district of the Congo cataracts are no larger, wings only 111 and 112 mm.  In the region of the Katanga the wings are appreciably larger, 116&ndash;121 mm., even 127 in a single female.  Hesse (1912) gave the wing-length of males from Angola as 116&ndash;121 mm.</p>
				<p>In habits this woodpecker resembles <taxonName idx_name="Campethera nubica">C. nubica</taxonName>, frequenting the trees of the lowland savannas, and feeding largely on ants.  Neave noted that the iris of males was pale claret or amethyst pink, but in my specimen I found it brown, lighter on the inner edge.  A nest found by Belcher on October 29 in southern Nyasaland held two eggs, 26.5 &times; 19 mm., as well as one of a honey-guide.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;From Mt. Kenya and the Kikuyu highlands west to Mt.

The typical race has been said to extend to Toro and the Kivu Volcanoes, while a separate race, <taxonName idx_name="Campethera t&aelig;niol&aelig;ma barak&aelig;">C.t. barak&aelig;</taxonName>, is supposedly restricted to the mountains northwest of Tanganyika.  The validity of <taxonName idx_name="Campethera t&aelig;niol&aelig;ma barak&aelig;">barak&aelig;</taxonName> is not yet proved, and the distinctions given it in the original description do not seem to hold good.</p>
				<p>At Djugu, 5400 feet, west of Lake Albert, we collected an adult male on August 16, 1926.  For some obscure reason the species has never been found on the slopes of Ruwenzori, though occurring in the Mpanga forest just to the east.  I also obtained a male at 5300 feet on the mountains east of the Rutshuru Plain, but saw none on the Kivu Volcanoes. Mr. G. Babault showed me a male from the forest near the Mokoto lakes.</p>
				<p>This green woodpecker is restricted to heavy forests above 4900 feet, where it leads a quiet and solitary life, feeding on ants and their pup&aelig;.  Its iris is deep crimson.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;From Southeast Rhodesia and Beira north to Malindi on the east coast, southern Uganda, the Kivu district, and southeastern Congo.</p>
				<p>The type locality of <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Campethera cailliautii cailliautii">C. c. cailliautii</taxonName> (Malherbe)</taxon> was restricted by Claude Grant<note n="1">1915, Ibis, p. 454.</note> to Mombasa, and its range extends along the coastal region of East Africa from Malindi south to Zanzibar.  Its wing measures 88&ndash;99 mm.  <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Campethera cailliautii loveridgei">C. c. loveridgei</taxonName> Hartert</taxon><note n="2">1920, B. B. O. C., XL, p. 139 (Morogoro).</note> of Tanganyika Territory is supposedly more greenish above and below, with round breast-spots larger.</p>
				<p><taxon><taxonName idx_name="Campethera cailliautii nyans&aelig;">C. c. nyans&aelig;</taxonName> (Neumann)</taxon>, with longer wings (101&ndash;106 mm.), is probably streaked on the throat only when young.  Dr. Hartert (1925) restricted its range to the region around the southern and western shores of Lake Victoria.  To this form, it would seem, we must refer Grauer&apos;s specimen from the Rutshuru Plain and Ghesqui&egrave;re&apos;s from Rutshuru.</p>
				<p><taxon><taxonName idx_name="Campethera cailliautii f&uuml;lleborni">C. c. f&uuml;lleborni</taxonName> (Neumann)</taxon>, with wings 95&ndash;106 mm., is supposed to have median rectrices tipped with blackish, the black breast-spots larger, or merging more or less into bars, at least on the flanks.<note n="3">These are the color-characters as given by several authors, but Dr. Hesse (1912) pointed out that they were not very reliable.  My own examination of the Berlin material in 1937 makes me doubt the validity of <taxonName idx_name="Campethera cailliautii f&uuml;lleborni">f&uuml;lleborni</taxonName>.  It may not be separable from <taxonName idx_name="Campethera cailliautii nyans&aelig;">nyans&aelig;</taxonName>.</note> Its range is from the vicinity of Beira to Northwest Rhodesia, the southeastern Congo, and the northern end of Lake Tanganyika.</p>
				<p>The subspecies <taxonName idx_name="Campethera cailliautii nyans&aelig;">nyans&aelig;</taxonName> is evidently a very rare bird in the Kivu district, restricted to the lowlands near Rutshuru and those near the Kagera River.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;Supposedly from the coast of Mozambique to Northwest Rhodesia, the Katanga, southern Lulua district, savannas of the Manyema, and the north end of Lake Tanganyika.  Sclater referred the birds of the Katanga to <taxonName idx_name="Campethera cailliautii nyans&aelig;">nyans&aelig;</taxonName>, but Hartert was positive that they are <taxonName idx_name="Campethera cailliautii f&uuml;lleborni">f&uuml;lleborni</taxonName>.</p>
				<p>J.T. Zimmer collected a male at Katapena, and the Congo Museum has specimens from Elisabethville, Kapiri, Lake Musolo, and Dilolo Mission.  There are two more from Elisabethville in De Riemaecker&apos;s collection.  Wings of four males, 99&ndash;103 mm., of four females 100&ndash;106. The size of the spots on breast varies, but they are usually rather large, 2.3 to 3 mm. in diameter.  The median rectrices of these examples are not blackish at tips.  At Tervueren there is also a male from Baraka, with wing 98 mm. and spots on breast not very large.</p>
				<p>Little or nothing is recorded of the habits of this woodpecker.  It is evidently an inhabitant of lowland savannas with many trees, and doubtless behaves like <taxonName idx_name="Campethera permista">C. permista</taxonName> of the western forest area.  B&ouml;hm compared its voice to that of the lesser spotted woodpecker of Europe.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;Gold Coast to the northeastern Congo and south to northern Angola; also the Omo River region in southern Abyssinia, but not known from Uganda.</p>
				<p><taxonName idx_name="Campethera permista permista">C. p. permista</taxonName> extends from the Cameroon River southward to Ndala Tando in Angola and eastward across the whole Lower Guinea forest to the Semliki Valley.  It extends far out in gallery forests both to the north and to the south.  <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Campethera permista togoensis">C. p. togoensis</taxonName> (Neumann)</taxon>,<note n="1">1904, J. f.

It is confined to southwestern Abyssinia.</p>
				<p>Northern Angola was believed by Neumann to have a special race, <taxonName idx_name="Campethera permista angolensis">angolensis</taxonName>, intermediate in color between <taxonName idx_name="Campethera permista permista">permista</taxonName> and <taxonName idx_name="Campethera permista kaffensis">kaffensis</taxonName>, but with still longer wings, 104&ndash;107 mm.  I fail to see any difference in color for Angolan specimens.  Adults from the Mayombe and the Ituri forests have wings 94.5&ndash;100.5 mm., while one adult male from Ndala Tando has the wing only 98 mm., and another from Kasanga near the Kwango River 98.  All around the borders of the forest region I find a slight increase in average wing-length.  In specimens from the Kasai this measurement is 98&ndash;105 mm., from the Semliki Valley 96&ndash;101, from
<pb n="572" id="t000120-p00578c.tif"/> Buta in the Lower Uelle, 92&ndash;103.  Our three adults from Niangara and Faradje in the Upper Uelle have wings 99&ndash;101.5 mm.  Accordingly, I do not recognize <taxonName idx_name="Campethera permista angolensis">angolensis</taxonName>.</p>
				<p>The Picid&aelig; form by no means a conspicuous part of the Congo avifauna, and I traveled afoot for ten days along the forest road east of Stanleyville before seeing my first woodpecker, a <taxonName>Campethera permista</taxonName>. This is one of the ordinary woodpeckers over all the forest area of the Congo, but found in second growth and forest galleries, not in large tracts of primary growth.  It has a deeply undulating flight, and is not a sociable bird.  The note is a sort of whine.</p>
				<p>Its breeding appears to be carried on largely during the rains.  A male bird with two naked young and an addled egg (taken from the nest) was brought to us at Medje on March 28; a nestling on May 17, and a breeding female&mdash;not its parent&mdash;the same day.  Birds taken in November, January, and February had gonads in resting stage, whereas those in June and October showed slight enlargement.  At Batama, closer to the equator, a breeding female was taken in September.</p>
				<p>The young male from Medje, in juvenal plumage, has the forehead and anterior half of crown blackish, with minute spots of buff.  On the posterior part of the crown the blackish feathers become tipped with red; and the whole nape is red, but little duller than in adults.  The black spots on throat and malar region are not so small and round as in adults; the barring of the breast is less regular, and more obscured by the yellowish feather-tips.  Back and wings bright green, of a less yellowish cast than in adults.</p>
				<p>A more confirmed ant-eater than this woodpecker would be hard to find.  Small dark-colored ants, occasionally mixed with their pup&aelig;, were the sole food discovered in 14 stomachs, many of which were entirely filled.  In one case I noted that the &quot;crop&quot; was also distended with them.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;Sierra Leone to Cameroon and northern Angola; eastward to Mt. Elgon, Kavirondo district, Semliki Valley, Rutshuru Valley, and Kabambar&eacute;.</p>
				<p><taxonName idx_name="Campethera caroli caroli">C. c. caroli</taxonName> occupies the whole Lower Guinea forest, extending out in gallery forests of the Uelle and Kasai, and reaching the Gold Coast and the forest patches of northern Angola.  <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Campethera caroli arizelus">C. c. arizelus</taxonName> (Oberholser)</taxon>, with fewer and smaller buffy spots on underparts, and lighter rufous band on ear-region, inhabits the forests of Liberia.  <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Campethera caroli budongoensis">C. c. budongoensis</taxonName> van Someren</taxon>,<note n="1">1921, B. B. O. C., XLI, p. 105 (Bugoma forest, Uganda).</note> of the heavily wooded areas in Uganda and Kavirondo, is supposedly greener&mdash;less golden&mdash;on the upper surface than typical <taxonName idx_name="Campethera caroli caroli">caroli</taxonName>, with paler spotting below.  The difference is slight at best, and I prefer to keep all the Belgian Congo birds with the typical form, although eastern specimens may differ slightly in the color of the back.</p>
				<p>The wash of rufous brown sometimes seen on the breast of Congo and Cameroon examples is undoubtedly a stain from the bark of trees. On other individuals there is sometimes a strong green stain, of the color of Paris green, which was remarked upon by Kelsall<note n="2">1914, Ibis, p. 214.</note> in Sierra Leone, and is to be seen in some Cameroon specimens as well as a few from the Congo.  It comes perhaps from green alg&aelig; growing on bark or in rotten
<pb n="574" id="t000120-p00580c.tif"/> wood, and is remarkably permanent.  In South America the rufous woodpeckers of the genus <taxonName>Celeus</taxonName> occasionally exhibit a very similar green stain.</p>
				<p>The brown-eared woodpecker is a characteristic bird of the whole Congo forest, but does not ascend the mountains.  Dr. Schouteden and I have both found it in the Mayombe forest.  In the Ituri and at Lukolela it is common, a rather silent bird seen climbing on the lower half of forest trees, but not doing much pecking of wood.  One or two may often be seen with a mixed bird party.  Beyond the edge of unbroken forest in the Uelle it becomes rarer; and near Faradje we saw but a single pair, in the dense wood near Madrapili, on the road to Aba. One specimen in the Congo Museum came from the Molindi River, a tributary of the Rutshuru; and this woodpecker appears to be fairly common in suitable places in the northern half of the Kasai district. There is even one female in the Congo Museum from Dilolo Mission in the Lulua district.</p>
				<p>Dissections of our specimens of <taxonName idx_name="Campethera caroli">C. caroli</taxonName> showed clearly that the dry season is the period of reproduction.  In the Ituri and Uelle the sexual organs were well developed from November to February, inclusive. South of the equator, at Lukolela, I took a female with a soft egg in the oviduct on August 3.</p>
				<p>Nests of this species, in holes in trees, were found several times by L. Petit<note n="1">1899, Mem. Soc. Zool. France, XII, p. 64.</note> in the region of Landana.  The eggs were three, and pure white, being incubated, he noted, by both sexes.  Bates<note n="2">1911, Ibis, p. 508.</note> reported nests in the Cameroon during January and February, with two eggs or young, though he believed they might lay as many as four eggs.  Two eggs he found to measure 26 &times; 19 mm., their color being glossy white. Two eggs in the Congo Museum from Buta measure 26.9 &times; 17.7 and 27.1 &times; 17.8 mm.</p>
				<p>When determining the sex, I found that in males of <taxonName>Campethera</taxonName> the left testis, which is apt to be slightly larger, often exhibits a very unusual shape, being bent abruptly outward at the anterior end.  Such a condition was specially noted in two males of <taxonName idx_name="Campethera caroli caroli">C. c. caroli</taxonName>, two of <taxonName idx_name="Campethera nivosa herberti">C. nivosa herberti</taxonName>, and one each of <taxonName idx_name="Campethera nubica nubica">C. n. nubica</taxonName>, <taxonName idx_name="Campethera punctuligera balia">C. punctuligera balia</taxonName>, and <taxonName idx_name="Campethera abingoni annectens">C. abingoni annectens</taxonName>.  It was probably passed over in some other cases, and is perhaps the usual state.  I have not noticed it in woodpeckers of any other genus except <taxonName>Colaptes</taxonName> auratus of North America.</p>
				<p>The food of <taxonName>Campethera caroli</taxonName> is largely of small ants, with their
<pb n="575" id="t000120-p00581c.tif"/> larv&aelig; or pup&aelig;.  Ants were found in all the five stomachs examined, but four caterpillars and a soft pupa&mdash;not of an ant&mdash;were also listed in their contents.</p>

				<p>There can be no doubt of the occurrence of <taxonName idx_name="Campethera nivosa efulenensis">efulenensis</taxonName> in the Mayombe forest, though no specimen has been reported from that area, because Petit found this little woodpecker on the Loemma River, not far to the northwest.  The Congo Museum has an old mounted specimen from the vicinity of Kisantu, also an adult female and a young bird with tail not quite full-grown from Thysville.</p>

				<p>ADULT MALE.&mdash;Iris reddish brown; bill dark gray; feet green, of nearly same shade as plumage of back.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;From the middle Congo River near Bolobo and the Ubangi River east to the upper Uelle, the Budongo and Mabira forests in Uganda, and no doubt the Manyema.  To the southward it extends to the Kasai district.  Specimens from Lukolela and Luluabourg do not differ from those of the Ituri and Semliki Valley.</p>
				<p>The young in juvenal plumage show the same sexual difference as adults, the young female having no red on crown or nape, while the young male has the nape-feathers tipped with red.  These red tips are a little shorter and less lustrous than in the adult.</p>
				<p>This common little green woodpecker of the Upper Congo is encountered singly or in pairs in virgin forest and second-growth woods, searching the trunks of small trees for ants.  It keeps generally within a few yards of the ground, but without exhibiting the slightest terrestrial tendencies, and often accompanies foraging parties of passerine birds.  I do not recall ever having heard its voice.</p>
				<p>Food is furnished by the ever-abundant little black ants (<taxonName package="hymenoptera">Crematogaster</taxonName>) which build large brown earthy nests in the trees.  They were found in all five stomachs from which I took notes; and the number of their larv&aelig; and pup&aelig; also ingested made me wonder whether the woodpeckers did not open a way into the nest itself.  Small cavities were sometimes noticed in the sides of such nests of ants and of termites, and finally at Medje (March 31) the natives brought us a very similar arboreal termite nest, in which there was an excavation being used as a nest by this small woodpecker.  A male bird had been trapped in it, and one of their white eggs was also preserved.  The termites were still present in great numbers.</p>
				<p>On returning to civilization I read with interest the description by
<pb n="577" id="t000120-p00583c.tif"/> Bates<note n="1">1909, Ibis, p. 20; 1911," idem, p. 509.</note> of very similar nests of <taxonName idx_name="Campethera nivosa efulenensis">C. n. efulenensis</taxonName> in the Cameroon, in structures built by ants as well as termites.  The eggs were always two in number, white, and measured 22&ndash;25 &times; 16&ndash;18 mm.  In a similar ant nest, but built by a larger sort of ant, Bates found a hole visited by <taxonName>Agapornis pullaria</taxonName>; and I may add that in a cavity in the side of an arboreal termite nest, between Banalia and Bengamisa, I discovered the nest of a dormouse (<taxonName>Claviglis</taxonName>) containing young.</p>
				<p>Although adult specimens taken in the Ituri from October to early March showed little or no sign of breeding, a young bird fully fledged was taken at the end of January.  Besides the nest at the end of March, we obtained a juvenal female in early April, and one dissection showed some evidence of breeding as late as May 8.  In the Cameroon Mr. Bates has found this species nesting in December, January, April, and June; and thinks that they avoid only the second or heavier rainy season.</p>
				<p>The development of the tongue is gradual in juvenile woodpeckers. In a nestling of this species, for instance, the hard tip of the tongue had as yet no barbs, being only slightly roughened along its edges.  Similarly, the horns of the hyoids, running around the back of the skull, reached only to a point between the eyes&mdash;as in the adult <taxonName>Verreauxia</taxonName> &mdash;whereas in the adult they continue to the base of the bill.</p>
				<p>It was in this young bird&mdash;in April, 1910&mdash;that I first noticed the small size of the innermost primary, and thus began my investigation of the primaries of nestling woodpeckers.<note n="2">Chapin, 1921, Auk, pp. 531&ndash;552.</note>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;Cape Province north to Somaliland, Eritrea, the Bahr-el-Ghazal, Benue River, and Senegal&mdash;but not in the central part of the Upper Congo forest.  It has long been evident that <taxonName idx_name="Dendropicos fuscescens hartlaubii">hartlaubii</taxonName> and <taxonName idx_name="Dendropicos fuscescens lafresnayi">lafresnayi</taxonName> are not specifically distinct from <taxonName idx_name="Dendropicos fuscescens fuscescens">fuscescens</taxonName>, and at last Admiral Lynes<note n="1">1934, J. f. O., Sonderheft, pp. 68, 69.</note> and Jack Vincent<note n="2">1935, Ibis, p. 20.</note> have rallied to this point of view.</p>
				<p><taxon><taxonName>Dendropicos fuscescens</taxonName> (Vieillot)</taxon> is divisible into at least ten subspecies, and possibly several more will eventually be recognized.  In southern and eastern Africa the back is boldly barred, toward the Congo this barring becomes weaker, and in Upper Guinea it practically disappears.  The color of the back becomes greenest, too, in West Africa.  The wing-length is greatest in southern Africa, gradually diminishing to the northward in both eastern and western Africa.  The changes are gradual, and it is not easy to say where one race stops and the next one begins.</p>
				<p>We may accept the following, provisionally: <taxonName idx_name="Dendropicos fuscescens fuscescens">D. f. fuscescens</taxonName>, Cape Province north to Rhodesia and perhaps southern Angola<note n="3">See, however, Austin Roberts, 1924, Ann.

Zool., p. 533 (&quot;Africa&quot;).</note> Nigeria to the Gambia.  Five of these races occur in the Belgian Congo.</p>
				<pb n="579" id="t000120-p00585c.tif"/>
				<p>The type locality of <taxonName idx_name="Dendropicos fuscescens lafresnayi">lafresnayi</taxonName>, in my opinion, is not Gaboon, even though Verreaux<note n="1">1855, Rev. Mag. Zool., p. 272.</note> stated that &quot;although sedentary in the Gaboon, it inhabits the whole coast as far as Senegal.&quot;  Even in 1861, Malherbe<note n="2">1861, `Monographie des Picid&eacute;s,' I, p. 204, III, Pl. XLIV, fig. 4.</note> had seen no specimen from the Gaboon, and mentioned only one with definite locality, from Aguapim, Gold Coast.  The type locality should therefore be Agaupim, and <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Dendropicos fuscescens zechi">zechi</taxonName> Neumann</taxon> is a synonym of <taxonName idx_name="Dendropicos fuscescens lafresnayi">lafresnayi</taxonName>.</p>
				<p>The race found in the Gaboon is to be called <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Dendropicos fuscescens sharpii">sharpii</taxonName> Oustalet</taxon>, and from this <taxonName idx_name="Dendropicos fuscescens camerunensis">camerunensis</taxonName> differs only slightly, especially in the more uniform greenish color of the back.  <taxonName idx_name="Dendropicos fuscescens lepidus">D. f. lepidus</taxonName> is only a little darker than <taxonName idx_name="Dendropicos fuscescens camerunensis">camerunensis</taxonName>, with heavier streaks and more yellowish wash on the breast.  <taxonName idx_name="Dendropicos fuscescens loand&aelig;">D. f. loand&aelig;</taxonName> is close to <taxonName idx_name="Dendropicos fuscescens sharpii">sharpii</taxonName>, but a little longer-winged and more boldly barred on the back; <taxonName idx_name="Dendropicos fuscescens camacup&aelig;">camacup&aelig;</taxonName> is as long-winged as <taxonName idx_name="Dendropicos fuscescens fuscescens">fuscescens</taxonName>, but a little more greenish above and more finely streaked on breast than <taxonName idx_name="Dendropicos fuscescens fuscescens">fuscescens</taxonName>.</p>
				<p>It is not without hesitation that I have adopted the name <taxonName idx_name="Dendropicos fuscescens camacup&aelig;">camacup&aelig;</taxonName> for the form occurring in the southeastern Congo, with wings 92&ndash;100 mm.  It seemed at first as though the name <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Dendropicos fuscescens centralis">centralis</taxonName> Neumann</taxon><note n="3">1900, J. f. O., p. 206 (Iringa, Tanganyika Terr.).</note> might be applicable, but the wing-length in that form was given as only 90&ndash;93 mm.  The race <taxonName idx_name="Dendropicos fuscescens loand&aelig;">loand&aelig;</taxonName> likewise has wings too short, 85&ndash;89 mm., and the male of <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Dendropicos fuscescens capriviensis">capriviensis</taxonName> Roberts</taxon> is said to have the forehead &quot;pallid gray,&quot; not brown.</p>
				<p><taxonName idx_name="Dendropicos fuscescens camacup&aelig;">Dendropicos f. camacup&aelig;</taxonName> inhabits the Upper Katanga and Marungu, and reaches Tembwe on the west shore of Lake Tanganyika, where Dr. Schouteden obtained nine examples.  Other specimens in the Congo Museum are from Kiambi, Lukafu, Kapiri, Kansenia, Elisabethville, and Nieuwdorp.  In Marungu Rockefeller and Murphy collected six examples at altitudes between 4100 and 6000 feet.  This woodpecker is common in all the wooded savannas of the region.  In Nyasaland, Belcher and Vincent found that the representatives of this species nest from July to October.  Two eggs measured 20.5 &times; 16 and 21 &times; 15.5 mm.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;From the coast of northern Angola near Loanda to
<pb n="580" id="t000120-p00586c.tif"/> the middle Kwango River, the Lulua district, Kabalo on the Lualaba, and perhaps the savannas of the southern Manyema.</p>
				<p><taxonName idx_name="Dendropicos fuscescens loand&aelig;">D. f. loand&aelig;</taxonName> is a race intermediate between <taxonName idx_name="Dendropicos fuscescens camacup&aelig;">camacup&aelig;</taxonName> and <taxonName idx_name="Dendropicos fuscescens sharpii">sharpii</taxonName>, with wings 85&ndash;91 mm. as a rule.

In the Congo Museum there is an adult female with wing 88 mm. from the Franz Joseph Falls of the Kwango River, and four examples from Kabalo with wings 86&ndash;91 mm.  No specimen I have seen from the Kasai has wings long enough for this race.  It must, however, be found in the Lulua district, though three females from Kinda and Funda Biabo, with wings 91&ndash;93 mm., approach <taxonName idx_name="Dendropicos fuscescens camacup&aelig;">camacup&aelig;</taxonName>.</p>
				<p>Three males from Munie Mboka, Dogodo, and Kalembelembe are of the size of <taxonName idx_name="Dendropicos fuscescens loand&aelig;">loand&aelig;</taxonName>, wings 86&ndash;89 mm., but greener and only indistinctly barred on the back.

				<pb n="581" id="t000120-p00587c.tif"/>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;From the savannas of the Gaboon and the Congo coast eastward to the Kasai district, and probably to the Lualaba River near Kasongo.  While found in clearings of the Mayombe forest, it has not yet been reported from within the southern border of the upper Congo Forest.  I never saw it at Lukolela.</p>
				<p>The reasons for my use of the name <taxonName idx_name="Dendropicos fuscescens sharpii">sharpii</taxonName> have been given above. This is a small race, wings 79&ndash;85 mm., yellowish green on the back, generally with rather well-marked dusky barring.  The specimens from Moanda and Tshisika are not large enough for <taxonName idx_name="Dendropicos fuscescens loand&aelig;">loand&aelig;</taxonName>.  In addition to the localities mentioned above, specimens have been taken at Thysville and Luluabourg.  I have not examined any from Kasongo, and cannot therefore be certain that <taxonName idx_name="Dendropicos fuscescens sharpii">sharpii</taxonName> extends so far east.</p>
				<p>We must not lose sight of the importance of the forest as a barrier in studying the distribution of this species.  When crossing the Congo Forest from Yumbi to Medje, we saw <taxonName>Dendropicos fuscescens</taxonName> nowhere till we reached the clearings near the northern border of the forest. There the birds have a much greener, less barred back, and certainly represent a different race, which we call provisionally <taxonName idx_name="Dendropicos fuscescens camerunensis">camerunensis</taxonName>.</p>
				<p><taxonName idx_name="Dendropicos fuscescens sharpii">Dendropicos f. sharpii</taxonName> seemed to be the only woodpecker at all common around Boma.  It climbs in the scrubby trees of the savanna, and the one stomach examined held many insect larv&aelig; (not of ants) and a few pup&aelig;.  Its note was well described by Petit,<note n="1">1899, Mem. Soc. Zool. France, XII, p. 65.</note> who noted that it loves to climb upon the fruits of the baobab tree.  Upon these it drums, giving also from time to time a call, &quot;trrrrrriiiii,&quot; which may be repeated five or six times.  It probably nests during the dry season.</p>

				<p>SPECIMENS.&mdash;Medje, &male;, Mar. 17; 2 &female;, May 15, June 5.  Dungu, &male;, June 2. Faradje, &female;, Oct. 23.</p>
				<p>ADULTS.&mdash;Iris red; bill dark gray, sometimes blue-gray below; feet grayish green.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;From the highland savannas of the Cameroon and clearings in the Cameroon forest eastward to the southern Bahr-el-Ghazal, clearings in the northern Ituri forest, and the Bahr-el-Jebel. Also the vicinity of Lake Albert, the upper Semliki Valley, and possibly in lowlands south to the northern end of Lake Tanganyika.</p>
				<p>This form has sometimes been called <taxonName idx_name="Dendropicos fuscescens lafresnayi">lafresnayi</taxonName> and sometimes united with <taxonName idx_name="Dendropicos fuscescens lepidus">lepidus</taxonName>, but it seems to me separable from both.  From <taxonName idx_name="Dendropicos fuscescens lafresnayi">lafresnayi</taxonName> of Upper Guinea it differs in being more distinctly striped below, and not quite so clearly green on the back.  From <taxonName idx_name="Dendropicos fuscescens lepidus">lepidus</taxonName> it may be distinguished by its slightly lighter coloration and shorter wings.  Five specimens of <taxonName idx_name="Dendropicos fuscescens camerunensis">camerunensis</taxonName> from the type locality have wings 78&ndash;83.  In seventeen skins from the Uelle district and Mahagi Port this measurement is 78&ndash; 84.  There is never more than a faint suggestion of dark barring on the back.</p>
				<p>A male in the Congo Museum from Zambo in the Semliki Valley with wing 80 mm. seems to represent <taxonName idx_name="Dendropicos fuscescens camerunensis">camerunensis</taxonName> rather than <taxonName idx_name="Dendropicos fuscescens lepidus">lepidus</taxonName>.  It appears likely that the lowland birds from near Lake Edward differ from those of the forested mountains.  I have even seen one male from Usumbura with unbarred green back and wing only 83 mm.</p>
				<p><taxonName idx_name="Dendropicos fuscescens camerunensis">D. f. camerunensis</taxonName> one of the commonest woodpeckers in the Upper Uelle, where it is a savanna bird, feeding about the smaller trees. It penetrates to the clearings in the forest about Medje, but we never observed it near the Ituri or Aruwimi Rivers.  I noticed it in lowland savannas near Lake Edward, but did not collect specimens.  This is not an ant-eater.  In one stomach I found whitish larv&aelig; of other insects.</p>
				<p>I suspect it is a dry-season breeder in the Uelle, for adult birds taken in March, May, June, and October all had quiescent reproductive organs.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;Western and southwestern Abyssinia to Uganda, Kenya Colony east of the Rift Valley, the country near Ruwenzori, Kivu Volcanoes, and highlands near Baraka on Lake Tanganyika.</p>
				<p>This subspecies seems to be a trifle larger than <taxonName idx_name="Dendropicos fuscescens camerunensis">camerunensis</taxonName>, a little more broadly striped on the chest, and more strongly washed with yellow on the underparts. Dark barring on the back is all but suppressed.  Birds from Abyssinia and Uganda are said to have wings 80&ndash;87 mm., and this measurement is 82&ndash;87 for a series of twenty from the highlands of the eastern Congo, from Ruwenzori through the Kivu to the mountains northwest of Lake Tanganyika.  A series of seven from Mt. Elgon agrees in color and size with those from the Kivu district.</p>
				<p>This small woodpecker is found in the clearings of the lower mountain forest of Ruwenzori, up to 7000 feet.  A young male, just out of the nest, was taken at Kalongi at the beginning of December.  It must have been hatched during the period of heavy rains.  About the Kivu Volcanoes it lives not only below the forest belt, near 6000 feet, but also in the <taxonName>Hagenia</taxonName> woods at 11,000 feet, together with <taxonName idx_name="Mesopicos griseocephalus ruwenzori">Mesopicos g. ruwenzori</taxonName>. This is a striking example of the way in which the nature of the vegetation affects the altitudinal distribution of birds.  The heath zone of Ruwenzori offers little or no food for a woodpecker, whereas the Hagenias of the volcanoes supply it in abundance.  So this bird ascends at least 3500 feet higher there than on Ruwenzori, and lives amid cold and fog.</p>

				<p>ADULTS.&mdash;Iris dark red, bill bluish gray with dusky culmen and tip, feet greenish.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;Northern Cameroon, Bahr-el-Ghazal and Uelle districts to Uganda and Ruwenzori, east to the Nandi country in Kenya Colony, and south on the eastern Congo border to Rutshuru.  While shunning the heavy forests, it approaches their northern border as close as Poko and Pawa.  One example was taken by Dybowski on the upper Kemo River in 1892.  About the base of Ruwenzori it is found only below 5000 feet, climbing on Erythrinas or other small trees, even in the elephant-grass zone, but never entering the mountain forest.</p>
				<p>In the savannas of the Upper Uelle this is a rather common woodpecker, often going in small parties&mdash;probably a pair of adults with their full-grown young.  Their voice is frequently heard, sounding like a dry &quot;ch&ebreve;-ch&ebreve;-ch&ebreve;-ch&ebreve;-ch&ebreve;&mdash;,&quot; and this note may be given also by rather young individuals.</p>
				<p>The breeding season in the Uelle is believed to extend from May to August, for young recently fledged were taken in June and September, and a breeding female in July.</p>
				<p>Our three young females all have some red on the posterior portion of the crown, but the red patch is not so extensive as in the young male, and does not include the nape in either sex at that age.</p>
				<p>Like other members of the genus, <taxonName idx_name="Dendropicos p&oelig;cilol&aelig;mus">D. p&oelig;cilol&aelig;mus</taxonName> feeds on insect larv&aelig;, worm-like &quot;grubs&quot; which we found in two stomachs, or caterpillars, of which four were found in another case.  One of the birds had also swallowed some adult insects of small size.</p>

				<p>SPECIMEN.&mdash;Medje, &male;, Jan. 26.</p>
				<p>ADULT MALE.&mdash;Iris reddish brown, bill blackish with base of mandible blue-gray, feet brownish green.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;From the coast of Cameroon and Gaboon and the Mayombe forest eastward to the southern Uelle and the Semliki Valley, southward also to the vicinity of Luebo in the Kasai district.  It is limited rather closely to the lowland forest area, and has not yet been taken in the gallery forests of the Uelle.</p>
				<p>The Congo Museum has a male from Buta, and eighteen other Congo specimens from localities listed above.  Yet I have met with it only three times.  Besides the example from Medje I have taken others near the Biangoro River at the western foot of Ruwenzori and at Ganda Sundi in the Mayombe.</p>
				<p>My experience agrees with that of Bates,<note n="1">1911, Ibis, p. 21.</note> who found it frequenting second growth and never virgin forest.  The softer wood of most of the trees in former clearings is probably better suited to its needs, for it feeds on wood-boring insect larv&aelig;, not on ants.</p>

				<p>This small gray woodpecker is fairly common in the northern half of the Uelle district, and apparently also at Mahagi Port.  It is usually seen climbing silently about small dead trees in the savannas, especially on native farms, and reminds one of a tiny <taxonName>Dryobates</taxonName>.</p>
				<p>Our dissections indicated breeding in the dry season, for the only bird with any enlargement of the gonads was taken in February, and a young bird was collected in April.  Nesting was observed by J. D. Clarke in the Ilorin Province of Nigeria in February and March.  A hole was excavated in the end of a dead branch about ten feet from the ground, and two glossy white eggs were laid.  The young were fed on butterflies and other relatively large insects.</p>
				<p>In two stomachs examined I noted small white &quot;grubs,&quot; a small white caterpillar, and remains of hard insects.</p>

				<p>ADULT MALE.&mdash;Iris dark crimson; maxilla blackish with light gray tip, mandible light blue-gray; feet dull green.</p>
				<p>ADULT FEMALE.&mdash;Iris rather light reddish brown; otherwise like male.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;Cameroon to Gaboon and northern Angola, east through the Congo to the Bomokandi River, the base of Ruwenzori, and eastern Uganda.  On the south it reaches Luluabourg in the Kasai district, for Father Callewaert sent us one male of unusually dark coloration. Dr. Schouteden&apos;s specimen from Luebo also seems darker than birds from the northeastern Congo forest.  The specimen reported from Mbwahi by Berlioz was received with a shipment of birds from that highland locality near Lake Kivu.  But it bore no original label, and its origin is not absolutely certain.  This male example is brighter green than any in the Congo Museum, and rather broadly streaked below. It would be very surprising to find this woodpecker in a mountain forest.</p>
				<p>For a Dryobatine woodpecker the present species has an unusually short, rounded wing, with large outermost primary.  The genus <taxon><taxonName>Polipicus</taxonName> Cassin</taxon> deserves recognition for two species, <taxonName idx_name="Polipicus elliotii">elliotii</taxonName> and <taxonName idx_name="Polipicus johnstoni">johnstoni</taxonName>.</p>
				<p>Elliot&apos;s woodpecker I found only in the area of heavy forest, sometimes in tall trees overlooking old second-growth, sometimes accompanying mixed flocks of insectivorous birds that went hunting through the lower forest growth.  On one occasion <taxonName>Campethera caroli</taxonName> and <taxonName>Campethera nivosa</taxonName> were included in the same party.  <taxonName>Polipicus</taxonName> is however no ant-eater, but hews beetle-larv&aelig; from the wood, several of them being found in each of the three stomachs we opened.  One bird had also eaten some fully developed insects.</p>
				<p>One of the males collected was drumming on a tree (September 17), repeating at intervals, like <taxonName>Mesopicos xantholophus</taxonName>, but not very loudly. The species also gives an excited, reiterated vocal note, resembling slightly that of <taxonName>Mesopicos goert&aelig;</taxonName>.</p>
				<p>Our four specimens were all non-breeding.  Between Mawambi and Irumu, however, Grauer secured two young in juvenal plumage in November and February, which I examined in the Vienna Museum. Both were labeled as males, and have the color-pattern much as in the adult male, but the plumage softer, underparts much grayer, and markings generally not so clean-cut.  The red of the hind-crown is less brilliant,
<pb n="588" id="t000120-p00594c.tif"/> because the black bases of the feathers show through.  It is curious then to note that in our immature male the nape is largely black, as in the female, with red nuchal feathers of the adult plumage coming in at both sides, as though it had previously been without any red on the head.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;Senegal and Gambia east to the Nile below Khartoum, northern Abyssinia, Kavirondo district, and Ruanda. Not in the equatorial forests, but on the south from the Gaboon coast and northern Angola to the Lualaba River.<note n="1"><taxon><taxonName idx_name="Mesopicos spodocephalus">M. spodocephalus</taxonName> (Bonaparte)</taxon>, with two races in southern Abyssinia and East Africa, is often regarded as conspecific, though much more richly colored.</note>
				</p>
				<p><taxon><taxonName idx_name="Mesopicos goert&aelig; goert&aelig;">Mesopicos g. goert&aelig;</taxonName> (M&uuml;ller)</taxon>, from Senegal to Mopti on the upper Niger, is a light-colored race with a diffuse wash of yellowish on underparts. <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Mesopicos goert&aelig; koenigi">M. g. koenigi</taxonName> Neumann</taxon> is another pale race, more distinctly barred, ranging from Timbuktu along the edge of the desert to the Nile Valley below Khartoum.  <taxonName idx_name="Mesopicos goert&aelig; agmen">M. g. agmen</taxonName> is grayer beneath than <taxonName idx_name="Mesopicos goert&aelig; goert&aelig;">goert&aelig;</taxonName>, with a restricted yellow abdominal patch.  It extends from the Gambia eastward to Darfur and the White Nile, and apparently also south of the equatorial forest from the Gaboon to the Lualaba.  <taxonName idx_name="Mesopicos goert&aelig; centralis">M. g. centralis</taxonName> is a little darker than agmen, with the abdominal patch more
<pb n="589" id="t000120-p00595c.tif"/> orange, sometimes a little orange-red.  It is found from the highland savannas of the Cameroon eastward to the Uelle district and Kavirondo, and south to Ruanda.  <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Mesopicos goert&aelig; abessinicus">M. g. abessinicus</taxonName> Reichenow</taxon> of northern Abyssinia and Sennar has still more red on abdomen, so that it is often said to form the link with the <taxonName idx_name="Mesopicos spodocephalus">spodocephalus</taxonName> group.</p>
				<p>Woodpeckers of this species from the southern savannas are certainly paler in color than <taxonName idx_name="Mesopicos goert&aelig; centralis">M. g. centralis</taxonName>, and I shall call them agmen provisionally.  From the savannas of Middle Cameroon Grote<note n="1">1923. O. Mb., p. 78 (Bafia distr.).</note> described a race, <taxonName idx_name="Mesopicos goert&aelig; oreites">oreites</taxonName>, which was supposedly lighter yellowish gray beneath than <taxonName idx_name="Mesopicos goert&aelig; centralis">centralis</taxonName>, with slightly shorter wings, 103&ndash;109 mm.  I have seen specimens from the region of Djang in Cameroon which I took to be <taxonName idx_name="Mesopicos goert&aelig; agmen">agmen</taxonName>, but should <taxonName idx_name="Mesopicos goert&aelig; oreites">oreites</taxonName> prove valid it may also be the race of the southern Congo.</p>
				<p>There are specimens in the Congo Museum from Boma, Luluabourg, and Kabalo.  I find the wings of seven examples from this southern region to measure 104&ndash;112 mm.  The wing-length of <taxonName idx_name="Mesopicos goert&aelig; centralis">centralis</taxonName> in Congo territory is usually 108&ndash;116 mm.  The bird of this species listed by Oustalet (1893) is a male from the upper Kemo River, and is colored much like the birds of the southern Congo.  Its wing measured 111 mm., while those of five skins of <taxonName idx_name="Mesopicos goert&aelig; agmen">agmen</taxonName> from Futa Jalon and Dahomey vary from 112 to 117 mm.</p>
				<p>This gray-breasted woodpecker must be rather scarce in the Lower Congo and Kasai, in view of the paucity of records.  Father Callewaert sent us only two from Luluabourg.  It would seem that the species has extended its range to the south either by way of clearings along the coast or across the narrowest part of the Cameroon forest.</p>

They are even said to occur side by side from Mt. Elgon to Baringo.<note n="1">van Someren, 1932, Nov. Zool., XXXVII, p. 283.</note>
				</p>
				<p>Two examples in the Congo Museum from Mahagi Port are a trifle lighter on the underparts and more extensively washed with yellow on abdomen than the majority from the Uelle, Semliki Valley, Ruindi Plain, and Gabiro.  I saw this woodpecker occasionally at Kasenyi and in the upper Semliki Valley, but it usually does not ascend beyond 5000 feet.</p>
				<p>About Faradje in the Upper Uelle, it is a common bird, keeping always out in the dry scrubby savannas, and often attracting attention by its protracted chattering note.  I never saw it go to the ground, and believe it to live mainly on wood-boring insect larv&aelig;.  These were found in the three stomachs I examined specially, but there were also remains of adult beetles in two cases.  On one occasion I saw this woodpecker catching winged termites in midair.</p>
				<p>The nest is excavated in a tree trunk, and the young are reared in the Uelle during the dry season, in January and February.  Adults taken in February showed enlargement of the sexual glands, which was lacking at all other seasons, even in two December birds.  At Lado

In Uganda, on the other hand, Dr. van Someren reported May, June, and July as the breeding season.  There July is a rather dry month.</p>
				<p>Both of our young birds have conspicuous patches of lustrous red on the crown, but that of the female is more restricted in size, scarcely reaching the nape.  This coloration is lost, of course, in the adult female.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;In heavily wooded areas from Cape Province to northern Transvaal, also in the highlands of Nyasaland, Uluguru, Usambara, Kilimanjaro, Angola, Katanga, Marungu, Kivu district, and Ruwenzori.</p>
				<p><taxon><taxonName idx_name="Mesopicos griseocephalus griseocephalus">M. g. griseocephalus</taxonName> (Boddaert)</taxon> inhabits Cape Province, Natal, and Transvaal.  Its back is rather dull green, red abdominal patch small or wanting, wings 102&ndash;112 mm., and culmen (to base) 24&ndash;30 mm.  <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Mesopicos griseocephalus kilimensis">M. g. kilimensis</taxonName> Neumann</taxon>, from Kilimanjaro and Mt. Meru to Usambara and Uluguru, is still duller in color, without red on abdomen, wings 102&ndash;107 mm., culmen 18&ndash;24 mm.  <taxonName idx_name="Mesopicos griseocephalus ruwenzori">M. g. ruwenzori</taxonName> occupies the highlands from Ruwenzori to the southern Kivu district, and is more yellowish green than <taxonName idx_name="Mesopicos griseocephalus griseocephalus">griseocephalus</taxonName> on back and chest, with large red abdominal patch, wings 108&ndash;115 mm., culmen (to base) 22&ndash;29 mm.  <taxonName idx_name="Mesopicos griseocephalus persimilis">M. g. persimilis</taxonName> of Angola, the southeastern Congo, and northern Nyasaland is like <taxonName idx_name="Mesopicos griseocephalus ruwenzori">ruwenzori</taxonName> but has shorter wings, 103&ndash;110 mm., and apparently a little more whitish barring on the flanks.</p>
				<pb n="592" id="t000120-p00598c.tif"/>
				<p>This is an excellent example of a bird ranging from South Africa up into the highlands of eastern Africa near the equator, and restricted there to rather high levels.  On eastern Ruwenzori Woosnam found <taxonName idx_name="Mesopicos griseocephalus ruwenzori">M. g. ruwenzori</taxonName> at altitudes from 6000&ndash;10,000 feet, but mostly in the forest zone below 8000 feet.  For some unknown reason I failed to collect a single specimen on West Ruwenzori, but in the Kivu district it is widely distributed.  At Kabara, 11,000 feet, between Mts. Mikeno and Karisimbi, it is rather common in the <taxonName>Hagenia</taxonName> woods.  Dr. Schouteden collected a small series near Lulenga and Burunga, at about 6400 feet; and in addition to the localities cited above the Congo Museum now has specimens from Mt. Sabinyo, 9800 feet, the pass between Sabinyo and Gahinga, 8500 feet, Nyabitsindi between Visoke and Musule, 7870 feet, and Bitashimwa north of Lulenga, at 6400 feet.  G.F. de Witte obtained two specimens near Nzulu on the north shore of Lake Kivu, and Dr. J.C. Phillips shot one at the post of Kisenyi.  G. Babault showed me an example from the vicinity of the Mokoto Lakes, at 5900 feet.</p>
				<p>Keeping very much to the forest, this woodpecker is usually found singly or in pairs, climbing on the larger trees.  Once I heard one drum, but did not notice any vocal call.  A female obtained at the northwest base of Mt. Mikeno on June 27 was ready to breed.  Of four stomachs examined by me, three contained insect larv&aelig;, while two held remains of hard-shelled insects.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;Highlands of Angola east to the Katanga, Marungu, and northern Nyasaland.  Not very common in the Katanga, where according to Neave it shows a marked preference for patches of dense forest.  It is found sometimes at relatively low levels, for de Witte collected one example at Kilwa on Lake Moero, only a little over 3000 feet above sea-level; and De Riemaecker has another from Futwe, near the confluence of the Luombwa with the Luapula River.  In Marungu, on the other hand, Rockefeller and Murphy obtained a pair at Sambwe, 6100 feet.</p>

				<p>ADULTS.&mdash;Iris reddish brown to dull dark red; maxilla dark gray, mandible light gray; feet greenish gray, claws more bluish.</p>
				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;Forested Cameroon, south to the Lower Congo and forest patches of northern Angola, eastward across the whole Congo forest, and extending out in gallery forests and patches of lowland forest to the Upper Uelle, the base of Mt. Elgon, the Nandi district, Semliki Valley, Manyema district, and southern Kasai.  Birds from Uganda are not separable, although they were given the name <taxonName idx_name="Mesopicos xantholophus chloroticus">chloroticus</taxonName> by van Someren.<note n="1">1921, B. B. O. C., XLI, p. 105 (Lugalambo, Uganda).</note>
				</p>
				<p>This is the largest woodpecker of the Congo forests.  It is rather common there, and climbs far up in the tall trees, even about the borders of clearings.  It hacks vigorously at wood, and occasionally is heard
<pb n="594" id="t000120-p00600c.tif"/> drumming noisily, though hardly for more than one second at a time. Once I shot a female which had just been watched drumming, so the practice is not wholly restricted to males.</p>
				<p>In the gallery forests of the Kasai the species is common, and there are two examples in the Congo Museum from Baaba in the Kwango district. In the Uelle it occurs sparingly in wooded places northward to Semio and eastward almost to Aba.  Dybowski&apos;s specimens mentioned by Oustalet (1893) were collected in the Mayombe forest and at Bangui on the Ubangi River.  I have taken one at Ganda Sundi in the Belgian Mayombe, and Dr. Schwetz obtained another at Tshela.</p>
				<p><taxonName idx_name="Mesopicos xantholophus">M. xantholophus</taxonName> shows considerable resemblance in the form of its beak and pattern of head and neck to the genus <taxonName>Thripias</taxonName>, and Bates<note n="1">1936, B. B. O. C., LVII, pp. 15&ndash;17.</note> has proposed its removal to that genus.  Adult males of <taxonName idx_name="Mesopicus xantholophus">xantholophus</taxonName> are distinguished from females by golden yellow streaks on the posterior half of the crown, the nape in both sexes being blackish.  In the immature male the feathers of nearly the whole crown are more lightly tipped with yellow.  The immature specimen without sex from Penge has yellow tips on the crown-feathers.  I believe that it is probably a young female, because of the length of its beak, 26 mm., as compared with 28 mm. in the young male.</p>
				<p>In spite of the slight change of season in its forested equatorial habitat, this woodpecker does not remain in breeding condition throughout the year, but seems to nest only in the driest portion of the year.  From Avakubi northward this begins with December, a time when we found evidence of breeding; and we secured young birds in January and also in April, at the end of the dry period.</p>
				<p>As befits a strong-billed woodpecker, <taxonName>Mesopicos xantholophus</taxonName> ignores ants, and preys on wood-boring beetle-larv&aelig;.  These we found in four of the five stomachs investigated.  One bird had eaten only fully developed insects, probably beetles, and another had included them in its catch.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES.&mdash;Zululand, Transvaal, and Bechuanaland, north to northern Angola, the eastern Congo, Somaliland, Abyssinia, Darfur, and westward to Bozum in French Equatorial Africa. <taxonName idx_name="Thripias namaquus namaquus">T. n. namaquus</taxonName> of southern Africa extends to northern Angola, the Katanga, Marungu, and Nyasaland.  The black stripe behind the eye scarcely extends behind the ear-coverts, its chest is grayish and barred.</p>
				<p><taxon><taxonName idx_name="Thripias namaquus schoensis">T. n. schoensis</taxonName> (R&uuml;ppell)</taxon> of Somaliland, southern Abyssinia, northern Kenya Colony, and the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan has the ear-stripe heavier, and extending much farther back, while the chest is blackish with whitish spots.  The upperparts are darker and less greenish. While this race inhabits the Bahr-el-Ghazal Province, it seems not to reach the northeastern Congo.  In Kenya Colony it extends southward at least to Molo, where Captain Caldwell obtained a female.</p>
				<p>Birds of intermediate coloration are widely distributed in eastern Africa, from Tanganyika Territory and Kenya Colony to Uganda and the district near Lake Edward.  The chest is more spotted than barred, its ground-color not very dark; the ear-stripe continues a short distance beyond the ear-coverts.  For such birds I shall use the name <taxonName idx_name="Thripias namaquus decipiens">T. n. decipiens</taxonName>.<note n="1">Moreau (1936, B. B. O. C., LVII, pp. 10, 11) regards <taxonName idx_name="Thripias namaquus decipiens">decipiens</taxonName> as synonymous with <taxonName idx_name="Thripias namaquus namaquus">namaquus</taxonName>.</note> <taxon><taxonName idx_name="Thripias namaquus saturatus">T. n. saturatus</taxonName> Berlioz</taxon><note n="2">1934, Bull. Mus. Hist. Nat. Paris, (2) VI, p. 230 (Bozum).</note> is supposedly a dark race from French Equatorial Africa.</p>
				<p>The typical race of the bearded woodpecker is fairly common in the wooded savannas of the Upper Katanga, where I have seen it between Elisabethville and Kipushi.  The Congo Museum has specimens from Kinda in the Lulua district, Kapiri, Elisabethville, Kasenga, and Tembwe on Lake Tanganyika.  Rockefeller and Murphy obtained three specimens in the savanna woods of Marungu, at altitudes between 3850 and 5650 feet.  They noted it as common there.</p>
				<p>The long wings of this bird make it a powerful flier, and it has a large, efficient beak.  It goes commonly in pairs, and its loud drumming seems to serve as a call-note, which is answered in the same way by the bird&apos;s mate.  Each call consists of four regular taps.  In addition it utters a loud nasal scream.</p>
				<p>Breeding probably takes place in the dry season.  The nest is chiseled out in a tree-trunk, and the eggs were said by Nehrkorn to measure 25 &times; 17.5 mm.  Carlisle gave dimensions that are considerably larger, 30.4 &times; 18.2 mm.</p>

				<p>DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;Central Tanganyika Territory, Kenya Colony, north to the Tana River and Nairobi, southwestern Uganda, and the northern shore of Lake Edward.</p>
				<p>In the vicinity of Lake Edward <taxonName idx_name="Thripias namaquus decipiens">Thripias n. decipiens</taxonName> extends a little way into Congo territory, about Kasindi and the upper Semliki Valley. Possibly it will also be found in Urundi or Ruanda, for Grauer collected some race of the species in the Kisaka district.  One might expect this woodpecker in the Rutshuru Plain, where there are acacia woods and areas of Euphorbia scrub similar to those near Kasindi; but records are wanting.</p>
				<p>In East Africa <taxonName idx_name="Thripias namaquus decipiens">decipiens</taxonName> is widely distributed, not only in the desert thorn-bush and savannas grown up with acacia trees, but also about the edges of the mountain-forest patches near Nairobi.  In the Congo it is distinctly a lowland bird.</p>
