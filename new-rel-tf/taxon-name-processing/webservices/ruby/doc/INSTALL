NameFinding Webservice Installation
====================================

Preparing the Environment
-------------------------

### Setting Up Ruby
The first step to installing the NameFinding webservices is preparing the environment. The webservices require Ruby version 1.8.6 or higher and Rubygems 1.3 or higher.

To install on Mac OS X, all you need to do is update your Rubygems. Open a new Terminal and the following command; enter your login password when prompted.

`sudo gem update --system`

To install on Linux, install Ruby using your preferred method: a package manager, download the rpms or source from <http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/> (scroll down to the Linux section).


Installing Webservice
-------------------------------

### Check Out the Webservice Code
In the Terminal, navigate to the location on your filesystem where you'd like to install the webservices, and type in 

`svn co svn://repository/ligercat/rails/trunk ligercat`


### Install the Required Rubygems
Now you need to install the Ruby libraries (called gems) that the webservices require.

Change directory to the webservices directory that you just checked out. *This directory will be referred to as the WEB_ROOT directory from now on.*

`cd WEB_ROOT`

Now paste the following three commands into the terminal.


`sudo gem install sinatra
sudo gem install nokogiri
sudo gem install uri
sudo gem install open-uri
sudo gem install base64
sudo gem install builder
sudo gem install active_support`



Installing TaxonFinder
-------------------------------

### Check Out the TaxonFinder Code
In the Terminal, navigate to the location on your filesystem where you'd like to install TaxonFinder, and type in 

`svn co svn://repository/ligercat/rails/trunk taxonfinder`


Running TaxonFinder
-------------------------------

Change directory to the TaxonFinder directory that you just checked out.

Enter the following command into the terminal.

`perl server.pl &`

This will launch the perl server on the loopback interface, running on port 1234. Configuration options for the interface and port number can be found within the servel.pl script.


Running the webservices
----------------

The webservices are written using the "Sinatra" framework which comes with an inbuild web server. To run the webservices on your machine, you simple need to navigate to the WEB_ROOT directory and type the following command:

`ruby taxon_finder_web_service.rb`


Deploying the webservices
------------------

The preferred method for running the webservices in production is Nginx + Phusion Passenger, although any rack aware web server will work for serving the web services (more details can be found at http://rack.rubyforge.org/)

If using nginx or apache with Phusion passenger, simply create a virtualhost as follows:

<VirtualHost *:80>
ServerName the_dns_name_of_your_webserver
DocumentRoot /WEB_ROOT/public
</VirtualHost>
