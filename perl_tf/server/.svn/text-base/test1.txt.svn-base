PROCEEDINGS. 



JANUARY 3, 1901. 

The iS7th regular meeting was held at the residence of Mr. E. 
A. Schwarz, 230 New Jersey avenue N.W. The President, Dr. 
Gill, occupied the chair. The following members were also 
present: Messrs. Johnson, Schwarz, Benton, Morris, Kotinsky, 
Busck, Heidemann, Vaughan, Caudell, Ashmead, Swingle, Cur- 
rie, Karlsioe, Kuehling, and Hopkins ; also, Messrs. Gould and 
Barber, visitors. 

Officers for the year 1901 were then elected, as follows: Pres 
ident, Dr. H. G. Dyar; First Vice-President, Mr. W. G. John 
son, Second Vice-President, Mr. E. A. Schwarz ; Recording Sec 
retary, Mr. Rolla P. Currie ; Corresponding Secretary, Mr. 
Frank Benton ; Treasurer, Mr. J. D. Patten. Additional mem 
bers of the Executive Committee : Dr. L. O. Howard, Dr. T. N. 
Gill, and Mr. C. L. Marlatt Dr. Dyar was elected as Vice- 
President of the Washington Academy of Sciences for the Ento 
mological Society. 

Prof. Trevor Kincaid, of the University of Washington, Seattle, 
Washington, and Prof. E. D. Ball, of the Agricultural Experi 
ment Station, Fort Collins, Colorado, were elected correspond 
ing members of the Society, and Prof. H. P. Gould, the newly 
appointed Entomologist of the Maryland Experiment Station, and 
Mr. Herbert S. Barber, active members. 

Under the head of Short Notes and Exhibition of Specimens, 
Mr. Caudell showed fifteen larvae of the Chestnut Weevil {Balani- 
nus rectus Say), all taken from one chestnut. Mr. Johnson said 
that he had taken six or eight larvas of this species from a single 
chestnut of the lt paragon " variety. Mr. Ashmead asked whether 
this was the same species of weevil as that which attacks the 
chinkapin. Mr. Schwarz stated that it was not, and said that the 
acorn species could at once be distinguished from the chestnut 
species by the difference in the length of the beak. It was inter- 



Z ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

esting, he said, to watch the males and females during the time 
of oviposition. Both sexes, to all appearances, perform the same 
act, the female boring a hole in the acorn in which to place the 
eggs, the male feeding upon the acorn from the hole bored by 
the female. In reply to a question asked by Mr. Morris, Mr. 
Schwarz said that the Chestnut Weevil is not so abundant in the 
North as in the South. Dr. Gill spoke of a larva of a beetle be 
longing to the family Calandridse, occurring in Trinidad, which 
was there considered a great delicacy by the natives. 

Prof. Hopkins exhibited specimens of a Scolytid beetle, sent 
to him from South Africa under the name Xyloterus lineatus, 
and an example of its work. This insect, he said, is not this 
species but a new one, and also represents a new genus which he 
has called Scolytoplatypus. It was named by him from specimens 
occurring in Japan, and he thinks that it has been introduced into 
South Africa from that country. 

Prof. Johnson reported two cases of serious injury done by 
the White Ant ( Termes flavipes Kollar) in the city of Baltimore. 
The first case mentioned was in a church. The supporting posts 
and some of the woodwork above had been very extensively 
honey-combed by the termites, necessitating a thorough disinfec 
tion with carbon bisulphide and more substantial rebuilding at a 
cost of $ i, 800. The other and still more serious case of the same 
nature was in a private residence. Here the insects had worked 
through three floors and into the cherry library cases on the third 
floor, completely riddling the timbers throughout. Prof. John 
son exhibited a portion of a timber taken from the house, show 
ing the work of the termites. Similar but less destructive cases, 
such as that in the Ohio State University and those recorded by 
Dr. Hagen in New England, were mentioned. Mr. Ashmead 
expressed surprise that the termite is so prevalent and so exten 
sively injurious as far north as Baltimore. He spoke of an in 
stance of rapid and enormous destruction by termites in the Philip 
pines, where a large quantity of pine lumber from the United 
States, stored there by our Government, was completely destroyed 
in less than three months. Mr. Schwarz stated that the true 
queen of T. flavipes has never been found, but that in every case 
so reported it has proved to be the supplementary queen. These 
supplementary queens are nearly larviform, and are short-lived ;

they are uncommon, though more than one has been found in a 
single colony. He doubted whether, in view of the roving habits 
of this species, a true queen really exists with them. 

Prof. Hopkins then read his paper entitled " Notes on the 
Genus Dendroctonus," of which he has prepared the following 
abstract for these minutes : 

SOME NOTES ON THE GENUS DENDROCTONUS. 
By A. D. HOPKINS. 

(Author's Abstract.} 

Attention is called to the meagre knowledge of the Dendroc 
tonus and the confusion due to the failure, heretofore, to recog 
nize good specific and secondary sexual characters. The genus 
is referred to as one of great economic interest on account of its 
being represented by the most destructive enemies of coniferous 
trees. 

Reference is made to the habits and distribution of the twelve 
new species named and described, and three restored from 
synonyms. The new species are named as follows: D. pini- 
cida, D. arizonicus, D. monticolce, 1}. ponderosce, D. keeni, 
D. fletcheri, D. piceceperda, D. dietzi, D. calif or nicus, 
D. s/ws/ione, D. wickhami, D. borealis. Those restored are : 
D. brevicomis Lee., D. punctatus Lee., and D. obesus Mann. 
These new and restored names, added to those previously adopted 
for the eight species described from this and other countries, 
make a total of twenty-four species twenty-one in America 
north of Mexico, two in Central America, and one in Europe. 

The species are divided by secondary sexual and other char 
acters into two primary, two secondary, and six minor divisions. 

Results are given of a detailed study of the ratios of difference 
in micrometer measurements of different parts of the prothorax, 
which showed a gradual decrease in the ratios of the anterior 
width, and the length, to the posterior width, from D.frontalis, 
which represents the maximum, to D. borealis, which represents 
the minimum of this line of variation through the genus. 

It was also found that the sum of the mean ratios (or per cent, 
of differences) of the anterior width to the posterior width, and 
the length to the posterior width in the different species, gave 
numbers which expressed, or indicated, the relative value of this 
composite character, thus determined, in the separation and 
classification of the species into what appear to be the most 
natural primary and minor divisions. 

The classification based upon the results obtained by the 
" statistical method " were verified by the ordinary use of secon- 



4 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

dary sexual and specific characters not available for statistical 
study. This led to the conclusions, that the sculpture of the pro- 
thorax in Scolytidae is of especial taxonomic importance; that, 
by the statistical method, progressive lines of variation may be 
determined ; that different stages in this variation may be indi 
cated by the sum of the mean ratios in a series of individuals and 
varieties, which will not only aid in the accurate separation of 
the species, but will indicate their natural affinities. 

The paper was illustrated by drawings of different stages of 
some of the species described, together with tables of measure 
ments and ratios, and a chart showing the classification. 



This paper was discussed by-Messrs. Ashmead, Schwarz, Gill, 
and Benton. Mr. Schwarz said that he considered the results 
obtained by Prof. Hopkins as correct, but thought that these 
results would be more easily comprehended by entomologists and 
other naturalists if shown in drawings or expressed in terms of 
descriptive entomology rather than in mathematical formulas. 
Dr. Gill thought it hardly safe to draw conclusions in regard to 
the course of evolutionary development from the data obtained 
by Prof. Hopkins' measurements. Mr. Benton mentioned that 
the variation in the length of the tongue in queen bees was made 
use of in separating the various varieties of honey bees. 



FEBRUARY 7, 1901. 

The i5Sth regular meeting was held at the residence of Dr. 
H. G. Dyar, 1512 Twenty-first street N.W. The chair was 
occupied by the President, Dr. Dyar. The others present were : 
Messrs. Ashmead, Howard, Patten, Caudell, Busck, Currie, 
Chapin. Kotinsky, and Barber. 

The Recording Secretary announced the death of Baron Michel 
Edmond de Selys-Longchamps, the distinguished Belgian ento 
mologist and authority on the Odonata. Dr. Howard, after 
referring to the Baron's long life of activity both as a statesman 
and a naturalist, moved that a committee be appointed, including 
the Chair, to convey the sympathy of the Entomological Society 
of Washington to the Entomological Society of Belgium in the 
death of their member and long-time president. The Chair ap- 



OF WASHINGTON. 5 

pointed Dr. Howard and Mr. Currie to serve with him on this 
committee. 

Under the heading of Short Notes, Mr. Ashmead spoke of 
the surprising entomological results of the Harriman Alaska 
Expedition. In the order Hymenoptera, he said, less than 
thirty species were previously recorded from this territory. 
In his paper upon Alaskan Hymenoptera about to be pub 
lished, embodying the results of this expedition, 311 species are 
listed, representing 139 genera and 28 families. Thirty of these 
genera are new to the United States, and five of the species are 
European. This collection was made by Mr. Kincaid in two 
months' time, and upon the coast only. The proportion of truly 
circumpolar forms contained in it was very small ; a great many 
of the species had a range extending down to Washington and 
Oregon. Dr. Howard remarked that Hymenoptera and Diptera 
have a rapid development, and, therefore, occur in large numbers 
of individuals and species in a country where the summer is very 
short, whereas other insects, such as Lepidoptera, which develop 
more slowly, are, in consequence, not so abundant in these 
places. 

Speaking of the White Ant ( Termcs flavipes Kollar), Dr. 
Howard thought it remarkable if this species has no true queen, 
such a queen being present in the European T. lucifugus. He 
inclined to the opinion that a true queen does exist, and would 
eventually be found. In referring to the damage done by these 
insects, he related a story told by a German traveller in Rhodesia, 
who had had his coat and boots eaten up in one night by them. 

Mr. Caudell exhibited the case or burrow of the Purslane 
larva, Eudryas gloveri Grote and Robinson, with a specimen of 
the larva and the moth into which it transforms. In Oklahoma, on 
April 1 6, 1895, he had observed the larva engaged in making the 
burrow, and he read from his notes a description of the act. 

Mr. Kotinsky reported having taken the scale Diaspis pen- 
tagona on Solanum canadense. Dr. Howard remarked, in 
reference to this, that DiaspinaB frequently come down off of 
perennial plants and live through the season upon some species 
of annual. 

Mr. Chapin said he had observed the butterfly Terias nicippe 
Cram, flying on the I2th of December. 



6 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

Mr. Caudell mentioned that he had observed a Calosoma 
larva engaged in eating the purslane larva before referred to. 
The beetle larva seemed to be blind. Dr. Howard, speaking of 
the sight of insects, said that it was by no means proved that in 
sects with eyes see as do human beings. He referred to the work 
of Von Beethe on the Psychology of Ants, Bees, and Wasps as 
bearing out this statement. 

The paper for the evening was by Dr. Dyar, and was enti 
tled : 

A REVIEW OF THE SPECIES OF HAPLOA. 

By HARRISON G. DYAR. 

The genus Haploa comprises a series of closely allied forms of 
broad- winged Arctiidae, formerly referred to the European genus 
Callimorpha. It has been the subject of considerable discussion 
among American entomologists. Professor J. B. Smith gave a 
good account of the genus, and brought the history of its litera 
ture down to 1887 in an article published in the Proceedings of 
the U. S. National Museum of that year. He recognized nine 
species. Since then the following has appeared : In 1887 Mr. 
H. H. Lyman published in the Canadian Entomologist, making 
eight species. His conclusions were much the same as those of 
Prof. Smith, and the differences of these authors were finally 
reconciled, the result being shown in Smith's List of the Lepidop- 
tera of Boreal America, 1891, with nine species clymene, colona, 
lactata, lecontei, contigua, suffusa, confusa, fulvicosta and ves- 
talis. In 1893 Neumoegen and Dyar published in the Journal of the 
New York Entomological Society, recognizing but seven species, 
lactata being attached to clymcne and fulvicosta to lecontei as 
varieties. Two older names, suppressed by Smith and Lyman, 
were revived, and a new name proposed for one of the immacu 
late forms. Vestalis was not identified. In 1896 I published in 
Entomological News a short article intended to show what was 
known of the larvae of these forms ; little enough it is. I recog 
nized six species, following the revision published with Mr. 
Neumoegen, but correcting the confusion that we had fallen into 
in regard to the white forms. I recognized vestalis as the white 
form of lecontei, and fulvicosta as that of reversa (suffusa], 
which Neumoegen and Dyar had unnecessarily renamed. In 
1897 I published in Canadian Entomologist on a good series of 
the formfulvicostQ) describing the larva and showing that the 
genitalic characters used by Prof. Smith were too variable to be 
reliable. In 1899 Prof. Smith published in Entomological News 
a description of Haploa triangular is, and in 1901 Mr. H. D. 
Merrick named a new variety of H. lecontei in the same journal. 



OF WASHINGTON. 7 

In 1887 the National Museum already possessed a good collec 
tion of Haploa, and since that time much additional material has 
been received, so that all the known forms are represented, many 
of them in long series. It appears from these that there are but 
five species, as I tentatively concluded in 1897. 

The Haploas present some interesting features. One species 
is practically without variation. Though its pattern of markings 
is a slight modification of the one which in another species is 
highly variable, yet here it is fixed. This is clymene Brown. 
Another species, also very constant, nevertheless shows some 
tendency to the breaking down of the dark markings, so usual in 
the genus. This is contigua Walker. Confusa is more variable 
and lecontei still more so. 

This latter runs from a fully-marked form to a white immacu 
late one, with, occasionally, some production of the buff color. 
Colona is the most variable species, changing not only from fully 
marked to immaculate by gradual obsolescence of the markings, 
but also from white to buff in the color of the hind wings, with 
all combinations of these characters. 

The matter is made more obscure by the tendency of the 
Haploas to occur in more or less isolated colonies, which usually 
breed true to a certain type, often considerably more restricted in 
its variation than the species at large. This gives the false im 
pression of a larger number of species than really exists, and 
makes the correlation of some of the forms difficult. The pat 
tern of markings is essentially similar in all the species, and neither 
the male genitalic characters nor the larvae seem to show any 
strong differential points at times where such would be useful in 
the separation of the species. 

The peculiar extensile, inflated and annulate anal tubes of the 
male moth, bearing a terminal tuft of yellow hair, described by 
Siewers and quoted by Smith, are well shown in a specimen or 
clymene before me, and partially in a male of colona.

This is the most variable species. I have a fine series of no 
specimens from the same locality in Harris Co., Texas, selected 
from a lot of 2,000 by Mr. Geo. Franck. This shows all the 
forms listed above except triajigularis, with nearly all conceiva 
ble intergrades. I am, therefore, compelled to unite colona and 
reversa, hitherto held apart. The fulvicosta race in Maryland, 
to which I referred in Entomological News, really varies as much 
as the Texan form, but never into bright colors or distinct mark 
ings. It is an albino race of the same species. 

Prof. Smith's triangular is seems to me but an undersized re- 
versa with the costal portion of the bands cut through. I have 
Texan specimens closely approaching it, though larger. It is 
.doubtless constant in its own locality, but I see no reason for re 
garding it as a distinct species, unless, indeed, we so regard every 
colony of Haploa.

In the typical lecontei there are besides the marginal stripes an 
oblique one from apex to inner margin and three transverse 
stripes. In militaris the basal transverse stripe is obsolete, the 
median one broken. In confinis the three transverse stripes are 
obsolete. In harrisii n. var., the oblique stripe is also broken, 
leaving only a tooth on the internal margin. In vestalis all the 
dark marks are obsolete. The variety dyari has the marks of 
militaris or harrisii, but the ground color of both wings is pale 
buff, not white. This is possibly the form referred to by Strecker 
as a $ clymene, which was said to have mated with a cf mili 
taris, producing "hybrids." 

Var. smithii n. var. Size of lecontei and with the markings 
of that forrri , but the upper part of the oblique band and the costal 
edges of the transverse bands are broken through. Smith's 
figures 14, 15 and 16 (Proc. U. S. Nat. Mus.,X, 1887, PL XIV) 
illustrate it. I am in doubt whether this is a form of lecontei or 
ofconfusa. Were it not for the size, I should unhesitatingly refer 
it to the latter species, as there is a persistent projecting patch 
below the end of the cell which seems easily derivable from the 
normal markings of confusa, but with difficulty from those of 
lecontei.

Var. lymani n. var. In this form the bands on the basal half of 
the wing are obsolete, leaving a band from apex, angled below 
end of cell to tornus and joined to the costal stripe by two short 
bands, more or less broken. It closely resembles the variety 
triangularis oflecontei, but the angle is more obtuse, practically 
a right angle. It has the size of triangularis and confusa.

This rather constant species may possibly produce a white 
form indistinguishable fxQTb fulvicosta and vestalis, but I have 
no direct evidence of it. In some specimens the band from the 
apex to the transverse band is broken through or obsolete, and 
for this the manuscript name lumbonigera, proposed by Dr. Asa 
Fitch in his collection, may be kept. I have another specimen 
in which the transverse band also is broken through, the specimen 
markedly approaching the variety harrisii o f lecontei. A full 
series of contigua will prpbably produce some puzzling forms. 
The National Museum has but 16 specimens. 



The large series of specimens in the National Museum collec 
tion, showing these variations and the intergrades between the 
formerly-considered species, was exhibited. Dr. Dyar said it 
was not improbable that more extensive collections might render 
a still further reduction of species necessary. In reply to a ques 
tion as to their food-plant, he said that larvae seemed hard to get ; 
they are somewhat general feeders. They hibernate as half- 
grown larvae and are very local. Mr. Ash mead hazarded the 
opinion that some varieties might be hybrids between different 
species, but Dr. Dyar thought it not likely. He thought that 
there were at least four good and distinct species. Isolated colo 
nies often keep to some peculiar type, though this is not always 
the case. He thought that there was a tendency toward the 
formation of species. The three drawers-full exhibited were, he 
believed, as good a series of Haploa as was ever brought together. 

The hour for adjournment not having arrived, the remain 
ing time was taken up by short notes. Mr. Caudell stated that he 
had received specimens of Melanoplus yarrowii Thomas, from 
Dr. R. E. Kunze in Arizona ; one male and two females were 
in the lot. Thomas's original type of the species has been de 
stroyed, and Scudder has redescribed it from specimens taken in 
Colorado.

Dr. Gill, referring to Baron Selys, and in illustration of the 
latter's versatility, mentioned the work done by him about fifty 
years ago on birds and mammals. 

Mr. Hunter, upon invitation from the Chair, made a few 
remarks on western entomologists, spoke of their isolation from 
one another, and told of some of the work being done by them. 
He also, as a note, reported having received from Prof. C. A. 
Hart, of the Illinois State Laboratory of Natural History, nine 
specimens of the Syrphid fly Merodon equestris Fabricius, col 
lected in a green-house at Urbana, Illinois. They belong to a 
European species and genus, which, he thought, had not previ

thenogenesis Among Bees," by Cav. Andrea de J^auschenfels, 
editor of " L'Apicoltore," of Milan. The Dzierzon theory re 
garding parthenogenesis among bees having been questioned by 
several practical bee-masters of Germany and Italy, the zoologi 
cal department of the University of Freiburg, under the direction 
of Prof. August Weismann, undertook to make careful micro 
scopic examinations of the eggs of queen bees of the species Apis 
mellifera. Of 29 eggs laid in worker-cells traces of fecundation 
were found in 23, while 94 eggs laid in drone-cells presented no 
such traces ; in another instance among 62 eggs taken from 
worker-cells not one was found that did not show fecundation, 
and of 272 eggs laid in drone-cells one only showed a vestige. 
Even when, as a test of the accuracy of the microscopic examina 
tions, the labels on material had been purposely exchanged, the 
results were equally striking and decisive, so that Prof. Weis 
mann concludes : " That it may be taken as proved that the eggs 
deposited in drone-cells are normally not fecundated, while 
on the other hand those deposited in worker-cells are always fe 
cundated and that, therefore, the theory of Dr. Dzierzon remains 
unchanged."

NOTES ON BELONOCHILUS NUMENIUS SAY. 
By O. HEIDEMANN. 

In collecting on the trees Platanus occidcntalis planted on 
streets near Brightwood, June 10 last, I found the underside of 
leaves covered with the larvae of a hemipterous insect in its dif 
ferent stages of development, and was able to identify it at once 
by the characteristic long and slender rostrum, which reaches 
to the apex of abdomen, as Belonochilus numenius Say, a Ly- 
gasid. A week later I secured adult specimens also in abundance 
on the same trees. 

It surprised me to find the insect infesting these planted trees, 
since it is not recorded as living on sycamore, or as being very 
abundant ; it has been considered as quite rare, and I have in 
former times found but few specimens bv sweeping; over the 
fields. 

The insect was originally named by Thomas Say, Lygceus 
numenius .*

12 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

Later, Pro/. P. R. Uhler placed the species in a new genus 
and redescribed it as Belonochilus 7zumenius Say.* 

The following November, Mr. J. Kotinsky showed me some 
sycamore fruits taken at Eckington, November 12, on which he 
had observed the young larva of a bug. The larva proved to be 
identical with those I had found previously in early summer on 
the same kind of trees. 

On December 8, I took from the sycamore trees, on which I 
had collected the insect in the month of June, a number of the 
fruits, which dangle so conspicuously from long peduncles at 
tached to the bare twigs, and I found on nearly every one of them 
a colony of the larvae. The ball-shaped fruit, known to botanists 
as a head, is composed, as is well known, of the ovaries contain 
ing the ovules or seeds. In the crevices or interspaces among 
the ovaries gathered on the head, the larvae hide, head jlown- 
ward, in a dormant state, congregating conspicuously on the 
underside of the fruit, probably adopting this place as the best 
shelter against the severity of the weather. 

Upon warming the fruit of the sycamore with my hand the 
bugs hidden on it soon recovered from their dormant state and 
crawled around actively. The larva can hardly be detected in 
its hiding place, because it matches in color perfectly with its 
surroundings. 

While Belonochilus numenius Say may live also on other 
food-plants, these observations at least establish the fact that it 
lives on sycamore, and also that it has two annual broods, the 
fall brood hibernating in the larval stage on the underside of the 
globose heads. 

Mr. Kotinsky, in discussing the paper, said that the larvae on 
these heads, when exposed to the rays of the sun, would move 
around, apparently seeking to find shelter. 

Dr. Howard's paper, entitled " Some Additional Mosquito 
Notes," then followed. It consisted of the most interesting facts 
taken from the large mass of information on this subject which 
has accumulated, through correspondence and otherwise, since 
the publication of his "Notes on the Mosquitos of the United 
States."! 

These additional notes are soon to be published. The paper 
was discussed by Messrs. Gill and Hay.

TO WHAT SPECIES SHOULD THE NAME ACRONYCTA HA- 
MAMELIS GUENEE BE APPLIED? 

BY HARRISON G. DYAR. 

Guenee gives a comparative description of the moth and a 
description and figure of the larva under the name hamamelis. 
We have a rather rare species feeding on the witch hazel (Hama 
melis virginica} in the larval state which agrees with Guenee's 
larva. It feeds only on this plant, and no other species of Acro- 
nycta so feeds to my knowledge. Therefore it would have been 
eminently proper if the name had been retained for this species. 
However, Grote, who became our first authority on the North 
American Noctuidae, applied the name to an oak-feeding species 
and named the witch-hazel feeding one subochrea. After this, 
confusion grew apace. Butler identified subochrea Grote with 
impleta Walker. Smith, who succeeded Grote as the authority 
on our NoctuidaB, accepted that determination, but referred both 
names to brumosa Guenee (the larva of which, according to 
Guenee, is the oak-feeding species called hamamelis by Grote). 
Finally, after a visit to the British Museum and an examination of 
Guenee's " types," Smith overturned all previous determinations 
applying the name hamamelis to afflicta Grote (another oak- 
feeding species), restoring subochrea Grote to the witch-hazel 
species and proposing a new name (Inclara Smith) for the oak 
species called hamamelis by Grote. Brumosa, which should by 
the larva apply to this species (inclara}, is referred to persuasa 
Harv., a species not yet known in the larva. 

The name hamamelis Guenee has therefore been applied first 
to inclara Smith, and lastly to afflicta Grote. In my opinion it 
is referable to neither, but to the witch-hazel species (subochrea}. 
As to afflict*, Guenee's description positively contradicts that 
species. Afflicta has pale hind wings, and Guenee says that 
those of hamamelis are " commechez rumiris" that is, dark gray. 
As to inclara, the description is nearer, and it is very conceiva 
ble how Grote, not knowing the larva, could have made this ref-

erence. Guenee, however, says his species is very near to rumicis, 
with the same design and nearly the same colors, and this is 
strikingly true of the witch-hazel species {subochrea Grote), 
whereas inclara Smith certainly differs somewhat in design. 
Guenee's so-called types in the British Museum should not weigh 
against his descriptions. The descriptions were published fifty 
years ago and are the ultimate standard, whereas the "types," 
after transportation and arrangements, are only now invoked. 
Therefore, I conclude that Acronycta ham&melis Guenee should 
be applied to the Hamamelis Acronycta, and the disagreeable 
misapplication of the name may be hereafter avoided. 



The last paper was by Prof. Cook, and entitled : 

EVOLUTIONARY INFERENCES FROM THE DIPLOPODA.* 
By O. F. COOK. 

A large proportion of evolutionary arguments and theories have 
been based upon studies of the characters and habits of such 
groups as the mammals, birds, insects, and flowering plants. 
Among these higher organisms there are many acute struggles for 
existence, and many striking specializations and adjustments to 
environment have been discovered. As primary evidence of 
extensive adaptation we have the fact of great diversity in habits 
and habitats among the members of each of these classes of organ 
isms, and it has naturally been supposed that in some manner still 
unexplained the varied conditions and the selective influences of 
the ever present competition have induced the changes responsi 
ble for the existing variety of form and structure. 

As a test or ;> control " of such inferences no better experiment 
could have been devised than the Diplopoda or " thousand-legged 
worms," a class of animals of great antiquity, some Carboniferous 
types not differing greatly from those of the present day. Since 
the Coal Period the insects have sought openings in all parts of 
creation, and have accomplished the most complex and wonderful 
adaptations to other animals and plants and to each other. They 
have distributed themselves over the whole earth, not excepting 
the air and water. The conservative diplopod, on the contrary, 
has shown no such enterprising tendencies. His ancestors chewed 
for a livelihood on Sigillarian stumps of Nova Scotia, and though 
the Sigillarias have been extinct for ages his predilection for rotten

stumps is in no way abated. He has not accustomed himself to 
any other diet than decaying vegetable matter, and he has devel 
oped no very acute preferences regarding the origin or quality of 
this simple provender. Back in the Carboniferous or before, he 
made a single invention of sufficient effectiveness to secure immu 
nity from molestation until the advent of the nineteenth century 
naturalist. He anticipated, in fact, the warfare of the future, and 
is prepared to deliver broadsides of prussic acid and other noxious 
substances,* which render him an unpleasant companion and an 
unpalatable morsel. But notwithstanding this effective equip 
ment he has remained an anti-expansionist. Others have striven 
for possession of the earth, air, and water, while he continues to 
live because he can subsist on what is not useful to his more enter 
prising relatives. 

Food being plentiful and unvaried, he has had no need to fol 
low the insects in specialized mouth parts. Having no enemies, 
.and living in concealment, he cannot be accused of mimicry or 
other ruses for self-preservation. He has not invited destruction 
by injuring others, nor overreached himself by attempting to 
increase too fast, and thus destroyed his own means of subsist 
ence. His eyes, when not altogether wanting, are only useful 
in his efforts to keep from exposure to light, which is soon fatal ; 
perhaps it poisons him by disintegrating his defensive ammunition. 
He cannot be seen by his mate, so that sexual selection cannot be 
invoked to explain his bright colors, f nor can these be looked 
upon as warnings to enemies, since he leaves concealment only 
at night. 

The diplopod has, in short, been exceedingly careful to keep 
outside the undignified struggle for existence. If he has become 
differentiated, it is on his own motion and not as a concession to 
enemies or adverse circumstances. The Diplopoda offer, perhaps, 
the finest of opportunities for the study of variation accumulated 
without interposition of the principles of selection. Without 
the introduction of diversity into the life-history of the organism, 
there have come into existence numerous groups showing great 
and constant structural differences, but each apparently filling 
with equal success the same place in the economy of nature. 

In the insects we find numerous adaptations of obvious utility 
occurring within ordinal and even within family limits, but in the 
diplopods similar reasoning finds but the slightest application. 
Drawings illustrating the peculiar characters of some members of 
the African family OxydesmidaB are submitted herewith. J While

in some respects unique, they are not more wonderful nor more 
difficult of explanation than numerous other differences to be 
found among the members of this class. Such extreme cases 
are, however, of special interest, since they illustrate more strik 
ingly the evolutionary status of the group. Among the highly 
adaptive insects it would be extremely rash 10 deny that any or 
all structural characters would find an explanation based on 
natural selection,* and in the Diplopoda we have also many pecu 
liarities of apparent utility which obviously may have been brought 
to their present perfection in this way. It is, nevertheless, worthy 
of note that in the Diplopoda such adaptations are almost ex 
clusively sexual, in accordance with the extremely simple ecologic 
relationships noted above. 

The Diplopoda have probably not been threatened with ex 
tinction by natural enemies, nor are their numbers kept down by 
inadequate food supplies. With them the struggle for existence 
centers rather about the problem of reproduction, their methods 
being at once primitive and complicated. In the different orders 
and families the extremely varied copulatory legs have been sup 
plemented by other contrivances frequently similar in function 
and yet different in structure and origin. Specially thickened, or 
in other cases unusually elongated, claws, pads of hairs, fleshv 
soles or cushions, rows of tubercles and other contrivances, have, 
for example, been variously and independently provided to render 
the last joint of the legs of males more effective in assisting copula 
tion. The mechanical ingenuity of the group, so to speak, 
seems to have exhausted itself in this direction, and yet structure 
and color, although neglected by selection, have by no means re 
mained uniform. 

Even in dealing with groups more adaptive than the Diplo 
poda, writers on natural and other forms of selection have been 

* Professor Romanes held that a majority of minor specific differences 
have no assignable utility, a view which he supported by reference to the 
color differences of birds and mammals. Had his observations extended 
to the Diplopoda there would have been no need of such limitations either 
to shades of color or to specific characters, since in this group structural 
characters of genera and families are as obviously useless from the stand 
point of relation to environment It is true, as pointed out by Professor 
Romanes, that the birds and mammals " represent the highest products 
of evolution in respect of organization," that is, they have been sub 
jected to an extended experience of acute natural selection throughout 
which there would have been a strong tendency against the accentuation 
of certain classes of structural characters, though, as in the Diplopoda, 
divergences might continue to accumulate in internal or reproductive 
structures which do not affect external appearance, or efficiency in the 
struggle for existence.

constrained to admit that their favorite principles must have raw 
materials to work upon. In other words, the advantageous 
structure or habit must reach the point of being advantageous 
without the assistance of the principle which then stands ready 
to encourage its development. Notwithstanding this defect, 
the theory of selection as variously analyzed and sub-divided has 
been and is still advanced as an adequate explanation of the 
modus opcrandi, if not as the actual cause, of evolution. 

In groups where complex adaptations to external environment 
have taken place, the issues are so mixed that contributions of 
natural, sexual, germinal, or other forms of selection and their 
resulting coordinations can scarcely be estimated, even in the 
most general way. The nicety of many adaptations has so en 
couraged the imaginative mind that extended flights of fancy 
have not unfrequently passed as sober theory, if not demonstrated 
fact. Of a bird or an insect blown to a new region, where it 
changes its climate, food, habits, and even its enemies, much 
may be predicated with comparative safety, and with sufficiently 
numerous factors of undetermined importance supplied by con 
veniently fortuitous circumstances, selection may be made to ap 
pear as the main-spring as well as the balance-wheel of creation. 
But among the diplopods, at least, the simplicity and uniformity 
of external adaptation, considered in connection with the quan 
tity and constancy of the internal diversity of the group, seems 
to warrant a view for which analogy indicates a wider applica 
tion. Diversity is seen to be essentially independent of selec 
tion. Selection accelerates, retards, or even reverses evolution, 
but by interference in a succession of changes which it does not 
cause. Segregation, of whatever kind, permits the accumula 
tion of variations which it does not initiate nor direct. The bi 
ology of the Diplopoda indicates that facilities in the way of 
segregation have long been ample for the differentiation, not 
alone of species and genera, but of families and orders. To 
prove with reference to any individual case the negative propo 
sition that no selection has intervened would be impossible, but 
the honest student will find the Diplopoda and other groups of 
similar ecologic status replete with instances of which the 
unique dorsal processes of the OxydesmidaB are a minor example. 
As a single more general illustration may be mentioned that of 
the repugnatorial pores, constantly present in some orders and 
constantly absent in others, but in the Merocheta having the 
peculiarity of occurring in interrupted series. The presence, or 
rather the absence, of these organs may well be correlated with 
habits or environment, but that the omission of the pores of a 
single segment or two segments from an otherwise continuous 
series is a matter of selective advantage or disadvantage is very 
difficult to believe.

Since in all other orders of Diplopoda the repugnatorial pores 
occur in uninterrupted series, that -condition may be considered 
to have been ancestral in the Merocheta as well. The unrelated 
monotypic genera, Strongylodesmus from Mexico, and Helodes 
mus from Java, approximate a continuous series, the sixth segment 
being the only break. The South American genus Eurydesmus, 
and numerous East African genera of Gomphodesmidaa, have but 
two interruptions, segments 6 and 8. The formula of Polydes- 
mus is, however, that which on account of its very general prev 
alence, is looked upon as normal for members of this order, 
occurring as it does in families the most diverse in other char 
acters. With the exception of those of the genera mentioned 
above, all other formulae may be considered as reductions of that 
of Polydesmus, the absence of pores from segments 6, 8, n and 
14 being invariable. 

Not only is there diversity in the number and distribution of 
the repugnatorial pores of the Merocheta, their position on the 
segments and the attendant structural modifications are equally 
varied and as little likely to have been brought about by any 
advantage pertaining to the different conditions. Some are close 
to the margin, some remote ; some elevated on tubercles or stalks, 
others sunk in depressions. But these details are merely illustra 
tions, not arguments, since on no one character or set of char 
acters could a negative proposition be established. The case 
must rest on the phylogenetic, biologic and ecologic unity of the

nivens (Cook), described as Scytodesmus connivens. Brandtia, p. 10, 1896.

group, viewed in contrast with its structural and evolutionary 
diversity. 

And since such facts are numerous in other fields of biology, 
there appears to be justification for the view that evolution is a 
kinetic phenomenon, or an active process of change, from the 
standpoint of the organism, instead of the result of a passive 
subjection to external interference in otherwise stable conditions. 

The static character of many evolutionary theories is obvious, 
and even those which depend upon physical or chemical lability as 
the moving force in vital phenomena, predicate, in effect, a tendency 
to stable equilibrium. The contrary view is that evolution is one 
of the normal properties of protoplasmic organisms ; change is the 
law, the various forms of selection and isolation are the incidents. 
Underneath the minor fluctuations which have been denomi 
nated " fortuitous variations," is a continuous motion, though not 
in a fixed direction. The minor variations may be looked upon 
as ' k feelers '" for lines of least resistance, but motion there must 
be. Selection or isolation may accelerate or retard the evolution 
of the species, but permanent fixity of type the breeders of plants 
and animals have long since found impossible. 

A kinetic theory of organic succession is not without bearing 
upon other evolutionary questions. For example, the acquisi 
tion of new characters, as in the case of the dorsal processes of 
the Oxydesmidas, becomes, in a sense, an axiomatic proposition 
requiring no special explanation apart from the facts of normal 
reproduction. Heredity to the extent of absolute duplication 
does not appear as a part of the programme of nature, and im 
partially fortuitous variation in any character or characters could 
result only in a stable, non-progressive average a state of specific 
equilibrium. To disturb this and make evolution possible, it has 
been believed necessary that selection or other external stimuli 
must be universally predicated. Under the kinetic view, varia 
tions may be supposed to arise and to be preserved as a part of 
the normal and necessary process of change, or because they are 
variations. The nature of the causes of change is not revealed, 
but it can be understood that the progressive modifications of suc 
cessive individuals may not be different in kind, or in any way 
more mysterious than those of the single individual, except from 
the standpoint of biologists who have invented complicated me 
chanical theories to account for what have appeared to them as 
temporary disturbances of otherwise stable conditions. 

The utility of a variation is not determined by the organism, 
but depends upon the conditions encountered, and the testimony 
of such groups as the Diplopoda indicates the impartial preserva 
tion of useful and useless characters. Selection works by elimi 
nation and affects the descendants of the survivors only as an 
active form of isolation by limiting descent to those in which the 



20 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

character or power of immediate advantage is already sufficiently 
pronounced to be of use. But after progressive modification with 
out selection has carried a new feature to the point of utility, it 
seems gratuitous to predicate another agency as necessary for its 
further accentuation. 

Instead of nicely balanced opposing principles, heredity and 
variation may prove to be merely two aspects of the same process 
of gradual change. Organisms react, within limits, to external 
conditions, some being more adaptive or more plastic than others ; 
they also acquire new characters with greater or less rapidity, but 
it is not necessary to insist upon any causal connection between 
these two facts. In some senses acquired characters are heredi 
tary, but it is not necessary, on the one hand, to believe that they 
originate from external causes, or, on the other hand, that they 
are predetermined by an inflexible principle of development. Of 
course, there are other senses in which it is true that no charac 
ters are inherited, only tendencies and potentialities, but this does 
not alter the case when a series of individuals is viewed as a seg 
ment of the evolutionary progress of a species. 

The history of the individual, like that of the race, variety, or 
species, shows a process of continuous change or progressive 
evolution which proceeds in spite of uniformity of environment. 
Isolation, whether geographical or due to selection or domestica 
tion, may influence the direction and rate, but is in no proper 
sense a cause of the motion. 



MAY 9, 1901. 

The i6ist regular meeting was held at the residence of Mr. John 
D. Patten, 3033 P street N.W., the chair being occupied, in the 
absence of the President and both Vice-Presidents, by Dr. Gill. 
The others present were Messrs Ashmead, Chapin, Barber, 
Busck, Howard, Morris, Kotinsky, Patten, Currie, and Sander 
son. 

Mr. Morris called the attention of the Society to the public ex 
hibition, soon to be held, of the botanical and zoological work of 
the Washington high schools. 

Under Short Notes, Dr. Howard spoke of the many inventions 
for trapping insects at light recorded at the U. S. Patent Office, 
mentioning in particuhir one such device being mimufactured in 
large quantities by a man <-it Hazeltine, Missouri, for destroying 
the Codling Moth. He regarded the statistics concerning insects 



OF WASHINGTON. 21 

attracted to light as not very satisfactory, and spoke of the obser 
vations of various entomologists. Probably the most thorough 
investigation of this subject was made on cotton-field insects by a 
Mr. Mitchell, at Victoria, Texas. Mr. Mitchell captured 24,000 
specimens at lights, and a determination of this material showed 
that about 15,000 of these were made up of injurious species, the 
remaining 8,000 being beneficial. Of these latter, there were 
5,000 specimens of a single species of Carabid beetle. Prof. 
Riley's experience with light in an orchard went to prove that, 
contrary to what the manufacturer at Hazeltine claimed, the Cod 
ling Moth was not attracted by it. Mr. Ashmead believed that 
seventy-five per cent, of the insects attracted to lights were inju 
rious. Mr. Sanderson and Mr. Busck considered the benefit of 
these traps as doubtful, but Mr. Busck thought a trap could be 
manufactured which would capture moths to the exclusion of 
beetles; he had used such a trap. Dr. Gill mentioned having 
observed a remarkable swarm or flight of insects to light in the 
Island of Trinidad. This flight lasted from twilight to very early 
morning, and was at its maximum at about 10 o'clock. Among 
the insects flying were many winged ants. Mr. Chapin said that 
enormous numbers of insects of all orders, and particularly may 
flies, swarmed to the electric lights in Chicago when the arc 
lights were first established there. In reply to a question asked 
by Dr. Gill, Dr. Howard thought mosquitoes were not attracted 
to lights. In conclusion, he said he thought the whole trap- 
lantern scheme for destroying injurious insects more or less of a 
fraud. 

The first paper of the evening was by Mr. Sanderson, and 
was entitled : 

NOTES UPON THE STRUCTURE AND CLASSIFICATION OF 
CHRYSOMELID LARV^. 

By E. DWIGHT SANDERSON. 

Few families of insects, and none among Coleoptera, contain 
more injurious species or do more damage than the Chrysomelidse. 
The rapid spread and voracious appetite of the Colorado potato 
beetle have made it familiar to every farmer in the land, and 
many of its near relatives are fast pushing themselves into promi 
nence. The flea beetles, grape and corn root-worms, and the 
cucumber and asparagus beetles, have caused the loss of millions to 



22 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

American farmers, and the defoliation of our shade trees by such 
pests as the cottonwood and imported elm-leaf beetles cannot be 
valued from a dollars and cents standpoint. A few scarcely known 
beetles are one day feeding upon a common weed in some out of 
the way place ; the next year we hear that they have ruined some 
crop of that locality, and in only a few years' they have spread 
over a large area and become recognized as a serious pest. Le- 
Conte and Horn have well stated that the function of the family 
seems to be to hold the vegetable world in check by destroying its 
leaves ; the trouble is that, from our standpoint, the beetles seem 
to have misinterpreted their duty, and to feel that the superfluous 
portion is that which man has planted. 

Although, owing to their injurious character, more of the im 
mature stages of the Chrysomelidag have been described than of 
any other family of beetles, still the larger portion are unknown, 
and most of the descriptions are incomplete. Furthermore, no 
systematic study of the larvae and pupae has ever been made of 
the family as a whole, so that the general larval and pupal type 
of the family has never been described that they might be dis 
tinguished from those of other families, or that the different types 
and species among the seven hundred composing the family (in 
Boreal America) could be separated. 

The work which I will briefly outline to-night was commenced 
as a thesis at Cornell University. Through the kindness of Dr. 
Howard and Mr. Schwarz, I have been allowed to study the large 
collection of larvae in the National Museum during the past two 
years. These, with my own few collections and specimens from 
various parties, have given me quite a representative series. I 
have felt the need, however, of material from the tropics where 
this family is best developed, but all attempts to secure it have so 
far been in vain. The study of larvae is certainly a new thing to 
most coleopterists. You will pardon me for quoting in this con 
nection part of a letter from Mr. Martin Jacoby, than whom there 
is probably no better authority on the Phytophaga, as it brings 
out this point very strikingly. " I should have been very glad to 
be able to assist you in your study of the larvae of the Phytophaga," 
he says, " but there is absolutely nobody here who ever attempted 
to collect or study the larvae of beetles, and I know of nobody 
abroad. I have no doubt that there are such people, but I have 
never heard of them. I myself am quite ignorant of the early 
stages of the Phytophaga, but the more well-known ones have, 
of course, been described in different works." 

When it is attempted to describe the larval type of the Ghrysome- 
lidae we are at once confronted by two obstacles. On the one hand 
the larvae of nearly allied families have not been sufficiently studied 
to make a definition of their characters possible, and on the other, 
types of the different groups of Chrysomelid larvae are so distinct 



OF WASHINGTON. 23 

that they have but little in common. In fact, as will be ex 
plained later, I am compelled /o consider the Chrysomelidae as a 
superfamily. There are several characters which I think will 
definitely separate any of its species from those of other fami 
lies. The antennae are of two or three segments ; mandibles never 
elongate ; prothorax never broader nor much longer than meta- 
thorax ; with chitinized notum ; thoracic legs always present (ex 
cept in one or two genera of Hispidae), short and stout (except in 
Cryptocephalidae, which are case bearers), tarsal claw single ; 
tergites of meso and meta-thorax and first seven abdominal seg 
ments never forming chitinized plates; ninth abdominal segment 
never longer than preceding segments (except in Cryptocephalidas) , 
tenth abdominal segment rudimentary, often bearing one or a pair 
of prolegs ; no dorsal tubercles elongate and lateral tubercles elon 
gate only in Cassididse ; a row of sub-spiracular, lateral tubercles 
always present ; setae stiff and bristly, never in long tufts. 

The antennae are typically composed of three segments, the two 
basal segments much flattened and the third conical or quadrate. 
Arising from the end of the second segment at the base of the 
third is an accessory digit, which sometimes becomes larger than 
the third segment. Indeed the latter is sometimes lost, and this 
digit appears to be the third segment. The third segment can 
always be distinguished from it, however, by its bearing one to 
several setae at its ; tip. Round, ocelli-like sensoria are often 
found on the second segment. The ocelli are typically 
twelve in number, four caudad and two ventrad of each 
antenna. The two ventral are situated on the genae, separated 
from the others by a suture, and it seems probable that originally 
there were a pair of ocelli on each of three head segments. The 
position of the ocelli is of considerable taxonomic value, but is a 
difficult character to determine, oftentimes necessitating boiling or 
bleaching the head. In two groups, the Donaciidaa and Eumol- 
pini, the ocelli are entirely wanting. In most of the Gallerucini 
but a single ocellus occurs. This seems to be homologous with 
the caudo-ventral ocellus of the four caudad of the antennae, as in 
certain species between the more typical Gallerucini and Chryso- 
melini all six ocelli are found, but this ocellus is very much 
larger than all the rest. The mandibles are typically five-dentate, 
though in one or two groups they are uniformly tridentate, and 
in a few genera entire. In some genera the number of teeth 
varies within these limits for the different species. In Diabrotica 
and several nearly allied genera, a curious tuft or brush of setae 
occurs on the inner margin. The labra are quite variable in 
shape, but always bear four prominent, stout setae. The setae on 
the cephalic margin furnish good specific and often generic char 
acters, though difficult to study, as they are easily broken off or 
misplaced. The maxillae are of the usual type found in mandib- 



24 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

ulate insects, though quite different in the different groups. In the 
Gallerucini the galea and lacinia are distinct, and both well de 
veloped, but in all others the lacinia is rudimentary, usually being 
represented by a small prominence bearing a large spine at the 
inner base of the galea. The setae upon the palpi and stipes are 
very constant in position, as they are on the mentum and sub- 
mentum. The labial palpi are small and of one or two segments, 
the palpiger being distinct only in the Cryptocephalidae. 

I have not, as yet, succeeded in satisfactorily homologizing the 
sclerites of the ventral part of the head. To the caudal margin 
of the submentum and the caudal margin of the occiput is at 
tached a membrane which is continuous with the prosternum. / e. , 
there is no suture between them. Beneath this membrane just 
caudad of the caudal margin of the submentum, attached at either 
side to the ventral margin of the epicranium and with the cardos 
of the maxillae articulating upon its anterior margin at either side, 
is a rectangular, well chitinized sclerite, which seems to be 
similar to the gula of the adult beetles and yet also seems to bear 
exactly the same relation to the other sclerites as does the tento- 
rjiuiLof the Orthoptera. That it is the same I am not prepared 
to say. Lying beneath the membrane to which the mentum is 
attached and connecting the epicranium, it seems to form the 
floor of the epicranial segment. 

Before proceeding to describe the thorax and abdomen it may 
be well to explain the system of notation which I have used for 
describing the body tubercles and setae. But first I wish to re 
quest that no one will ask me later on " What is a tubercle or 
seta," for I freely confess I don't know, though I have tried hard 
enough to find out. Tubercles, spines, setae, and hairs or acces 
sory setae, shade into each other so gradually and their structure 
is so variable that I am at a loss to know, how to define them and 
have not by any means secured a satisfactory knowledge of their 
morphology. That the tubercles and setae of larvae are of great 
taxonomic value has already been well shown in the case of Lep- 
idopterous larvae by Dr. Dyar and others. They have also 
been used considerably in the classification of Saw-fly larvae. In 
the present study I have found them of the greatest value and in 
terest. There seem to be a more or less definite number of setae 
in the most generalized larvae which are variously modified in 
number and position in those more specialized. When these 
setae are surrounded by a thickened or pigmented area, or where 
they surmount a protuberance of the skin, I have called them 
tubercles. Often, however, the surface of the epidermis is uni 
form in texture, merely being divided into areas by folds. In 
such cases the usual setae are sometimes distinct and easily recog 
nized, but many times they are surrounded by a large number of 
small accessory setae from which they are not distinguishable, as

in Donacia and Criocera. It would seem to me, therefore, that 
before the student of insect larvae will be able to use the setaB and 
tubercles for the purposes of classification understand! ngly, it 
will be necessary to know more of their nature, history and 
origin. Whether the tubercles and setaB of lepidopterous, hy- 
menopterous, and coleopterous larvae are homologous in any 
way or whether they had a common origin, seems to me to be a 
question of importance. Dr. Packard's views as to the origin of 
the spines and tubercles, and his classification of them, in the 
Notodontidas may or may not be correct for that family ; it cer 
tainly has no bearing upon the similar structures found in the 
Chrysomelidas. 




FIG i. Diagram showing notation of tubercles of the most generalized 
Chrysomelid larvse. (Represented as one-half of the larval skin is seen 
when mounted flat.) 

The tubercles as numbered represent those of a purely hypo 
thetical generalized type, and are not so to be found in any one 
species. 

On either annulet of the meso and metathorax below the dorso- 
meson are two tubercles numbered I, II. Ill, IV ; I and III being 
cephalic. Below these is a larger lateral tubercle extending 
across both annulets and outlining the forming wing discs which 
are immediately beneath, which I term V and VI. Below these 
are two tubercles, anterior and posterior, VII and VIII. The 
coxa of the leg articulates slightly with the caudal margin of tub 
ercle IX and caudad of it is X. XI is cephalad of the coxa. 
XIII dextral and sinistral are usually grown together on the 
ventro-mesal line. Caudad of them are tubercles XIV, between 
the coxae. The abdominal segments, I to VII, differ from the 
thoracic in that tubercles V and VI are separate, VII and VIII 
are united, as are IX and X, while tubercles XI to XIV are var 
iously modified. The tubercles of abdominal segments eight and 
nine are always considerably grown togethe~r>> l __>n the pro- 



26 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

thorax, tubercles I to VI are grown together and form the cervical 
shield ; VII and VII [ are sometimes distinct and sometimes 
grown together ; IX and X are as on the other thoracic segments ; 
XIII and XIV are usually grown together, forming a chitinized 
sternum which is cleft on the caudal margin. The tubercles 
are diagrammed as seen from the dorsal and ventral aspects, as 
most of the larvae are naturally flattened. In studying them, 
when sufficient material was available, I have mounted the skins 
in Canada balsam. 

The thoracic spiracle is always surrounded by or just above 
mesathoracic tubercle VII. The abdominal spiracles are situated 
either between or laterad of tubercles V and VI. Spiracles are 
always found on the first seven abdominal segments in the usual 
position. In theHispidae they are lacking on the eighth, but very 
large, round spiracles are found dorsally on the ninth segment. 
In Donacia the spiracles of the eighth segment are much en 
larged, are close together near the dorso-meson, and their bases 
are prolonged into long sickle-shaped horns which aid in respira 
tion. 

In some larvae the eighth abdominal spiracles are wanting. 
Just below the spiracles, at a variable distance from them, branch 
off from the trachea leading to the spiracle, two short tracheal 
appendages, which end blindly, merely forming small pockets or 
sacs. They are peculiar structures found in almost all of the 
larvae examined, whose structure I fail to ;,nderstand. 

The legs are usually short and thick. In one genus of the 
Hispidae, Octotoma, they are wanting. The segments seem to 
be homologous with those of the beetle. The coxal segment is 
much the largest, and is usually closely appressed to the body. 
On the outer side it is slightly articulated with a well chitinized 
tubercle which I have numbered IX, and which seems to be con 
siderably like the trochantin described by Walton. The trochan- 
ter is triangular, and the femur and tibia are more or less rectan 
gular in profile. The tarsus is short, somtimes hardly visible. It 
bears a single claw, and in the Gallerucini a well developed em- 
podium or pulvillus. Such is a brief outline of the characters of 
the larvae of the Chrysomelidae in the broadest sense. 

In their classification of the Chrysomelidaa, Leconte and Horn* 
divide it into eleven tribes, grouping them together as shown on 
the chart. The larval types of these different tribes are easily 
recognized, though their relationships appear somewhat different 
from those of the adults. 

The larvae of the Donaciini feed upon the roots of aquatic plants, 
are cylindrical, slightly arcuate, tapering slightly cephalad from 
the sixth or seventh abdominal segment, and sharply caudad ; 

(*Vide, p. 336, LeConte and Horn, Classification of the Coleoptera.) 



OF WASHINGTON. 27 

~ocelli are wanting, mandibles tridentate ; maxillary palpi of three 
segments, galea andlacinia present but grown together and highly 
specialized, forming an organ for piercing the plant tissue ; labial 
palpi of one segment ; prolegs wanting ; anus situated on the ante 
rior margin of the eighth abdominal tergite ; the spiracles of the 
eighth abdominal segment large, situated dorsally, and their bases 
developed into horns as already noted ; tubercles wanting ; setae 
occurring in large areas between the folds of the skin. 

Of the Sagrini, I have had no larva?. 

Of the Criocerini, I have had but three species of two genera, 
which genera seem to be poorly defined if judged by the larvae. 
These species seem to be more nearly allied to the Chrysomelini, 
quite distinctly so, though a larger series might show a relation 
ship to the Donaciini. They are cylindrical larva?, tapering 
slightly from the middle toward either end ; mandibles three to 
five dentate ; ocelli six ; maxillary palpi of three segments, lacinia 
wanting; labial palpi of one segment ; anal prolegs present; ven 
tral abdominal tubercular areas protruding ventrad and function 
ing as prolegs ; anus in Lema trilineata and Crioceris merdi- 
gera on the anterior part of the ninth abdominal tergite, though 
normal in C. asparagi. These two species cover the body with 
excrement. They feed upon foliage. 

In the Chrysomelini the larva? of the genera Chrysomela and 
Leptinotarsa have the abdomens strongly convex, while the re 
maining genera are more or less flattened and resemble the Galle- 
rucini in their shape. Ocelli six ; mandibles five-dentate ; max 
illary palpi of three segments, lacinia wanting ; labial palpi of 
two segments ; anal prolegs present ; a large part of the larva? 
having glandular tubercles. 

The larva? of the Eumolpini are nearly allied to those of the 
last tribe, are subterranean, feeding on the roots of plants, are 
short, thick, cylindrical, arcuate; ocelli wanting ; mandibles tri 
dentate or entire ; maxillary palpi of three segments, lacinia want 
ing ; labial palpi of one segment ; anal prolegs present ; tubercles 
sometimes faintly outlined, seta? strongly developed. 

Different larva? of the Gallerucini feed upon the foliage and 
bore into the roots and stems of plants. The most typical shape is 
that of the imported elm-leaf beetle, though the subterranean and 
boring larva?, such as Diabrotica, become very elongate and cylin 
drical instead of flattened. The Gallerucini seem to be the most 
generalized larva?. In a few genera six ocelli are present, in most 
they are reduced to a single ocellus, while often the ocelli are 
wanting ; mandibles five-dentate ; maxillary palpi of three seg 
ments, both galea and lacinia present ; labial palpi of two seg 
ments ; the usual pair of anal prolegs forming a single proleg ; 
tubercles well developed, generalized, rarely glandular, some 
times with a metallic lustre ; tarsi with a well-developed pul- 
villus. 



28 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

Of the Cryptocephalini, I have had no specimens. The Clyth- 
rini and Chlamydini resemble each other, and I gather from de 
scriptions also the Cryptocephalidae, in being case bearers and 
having the abdomen bent sharply ventrad ; ocelli six ; mandibles 
tridentate ; maxillary palpus of three segments, lacinia wanting; 
labial palpi of two segments, with palpiger distinct : legs elon 
gate ; prolegs wanting ; tubercles wanting ; ninth abdominal ter- 
gite longer than those cephalad. I have had but few of the larvae 
of these three tribes, and but few have been described, but they 
seem to be most nearly related to those of the Eumolpini. 

The larvas of the Hispini are leaf miners, and resemble those of 
the Cerambycidae move than most of the Chrysomelidae. Each 
segment is marked dorsally and ventrally by a transverse depres 
sion, similar to those found in the larvae of the Cerarobycidse, 
around which one may distinguish the usual setae after consider 
able study. The caudal margin of the head is produced strongly 
cauclad, to which projection are attached strong muscles also 
attached on the under side of the pronotum. Ocelli six ; mandi 
bles five-dentate ; maxillary palpi of one or two segments, lacinia 
wanting ; labial palpi of one segment, ligula reaching anterior of 
maxillae, maxillae and labium sometimes grown together ; eighth 
abdominal spiracles situated dorsally on ninth tergite and much 
enlarged ; prolegs wanting. 

The larvae of the Cassidini are probably the most interesting 
of all. They are flattened and elliptical in outline, bordered later 
ally with a row of long barbed spines (tubercles VII plus VIII 
on the abdomen, VI, VII and VIII on the thorax) ; arising from 
the ninth abdominal segment is a two-pronged organ whose 
prongs are really homologous with the lateral spines, known as 
the faeci-fork. When bent forwards the tip of this fork reaches 
the thorax or prothorax ; it is usually covered with the cast skins 
of the larva and a mass of excrement, in which case the larva is 
almost entirely covered by it and appears on the leaf like a bird 
dropping. These larvas have six ocelli ; mandibles five dentate ; 
maxillary palpi of two segments, lacinia wanting; labial palpi of 
two segments ; prolegs wanting ; head covered by the prothorax, 
mouth parts inferior. 

Upon comparing the characters enumerated it is seen that the 
larvae arrange themselves naturally into five main groups, with a 
classification somewhat as follows :

Labial palpi of one segment, ocelli

Labial palpi of one segment, ocelli 
six Criocerini. 

These five larval types are very distinct. There is less simil 
arity between some of them than between them and larvae of other 
families. It seems probable therefore that they indicate a better 
classification of the Chrysomelidae, ranking it as a superfamily, 
and dividing it into five distinct families. This is indeed almost 
the same classification as that of entomologists early in the last 
century. 

It is obvious that from the many characters which the adult 
beetles have in common that entomologists have had good reason 
for considering the Chysomelidas as but one family and its various 
subdivisions merely as series. But as Dr. Weismann has well 
shown in his "Studies in the Theory of Descent," treating of 
lepidopterous larvae, the generic and family relationships are 
most clearly to be discerned in that stage of insects in which these 
classes differ most in their habits. He there points out the in 
congruities between the larvae of Lasiocampa, Clisiocampa, and 
allied genera, and most of the other genera then included in the 
Bombycidas. and makes the query whether or not morphological 
differences do not exist in the adults so that these genera should 
form a distinct family. Further study of the moths has shown 
several distinctive characters, notably the wing venation, and the 



30 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

Lasiocampidae are now ranked as a family. He also shows 
that genera based on larval and imaginal characters more 
nearly coincide in their relation to each other than higher 
groups so founded. The following passage - seems especially 
pertinent to the case in hand: i4 In families there is again an 
increase of irregularity. Although larval and imaginal families 
generally agree, there are so many exceptions that the groups 
would be smaller if they were based exclusively on the larval 
structure than if founded on the imagines (Nymphalidae, Bom- 
bycidae)." "If we turn to the groups of families we find a 
considerably increased incongruence ; complete agreement is here 
again rather the exception ; and it further happens in these cases 
that it is always the larvae which, to a certain extent, remain at a 
lower grade, and which form well defined families, but these can 
seldom be associated into groups of a higher order, having a com 
mon character, as in the case of the imagines (Rhopolocera)." 
The numerous instances further sited by Dr. Weismann in dif 
ferent orders further confirm this view, whose truth must be 
apparent. Now the adultsof all the Chry some! ina feed upon foli 
age externally, but the larvae are much more variable in their 
habits, far more distinct in structure, and thus, as might be ex 
pected, show more clearly their relationships. As an example, 
LeConte and Horn have classed the two tribes, Hispini and Cas- 
sidini, as Cryptosomes upon their having " front inflexed, mouth 
inferior." If, as they state, the larvae of both these tribes had the 
habit of covering themselves with excrement, their relationship 
would seem more clear, but such is not the case. The two larvae 
are very dissimilar, the latter approaching the Erotylidae and 
Coccinellidae, while the former resemble those of the Ceram- 
bycidae, between which there is certainly no very great similarity. 
This is the most striking instance in which the classification of 
the larvae differs from that of the adults, though others are 
numerous. Inasmuch as the characters used to separate many 
groups of the Chrysomelina are confessedly unsatisfactory, it 
would seem that the relationships so clearly exhibited between 
the different groups of larvae may be of considerable value in 
securing a natural classification, or, if that be not possible, at 
least add to our knowledge of the phylogeny of this large group 
of beetles. 

This paper excited much interest, and was discussed by several of 
the members present. Dr. Gill said that one of the families should 
be called Cassididae, instead of Cassidae,* this being the proper 
family name derived from the genus Cassida ; there was also a 
family of Gasteropod Molluscs called Cassidae. He asked if the

imagines bore out the classification of the larvaa. Mr. Sander 
son replied that, roughly, they did ; he was not ready, however, 
to draw sharp conclusions, not having examined sufficient ma 
terial. Mr. Ashmead showed how the larval characters of Hy- 
menoptera bore out the classification of the adults, and also 
spoke of the value of the position of the ocelli in larval Homop- 
tera and of their development into the compound eyes of the 
adult. 

-The second paper, " General Notes," was by Dr. Howard. 
In the March number of " Entomological News," Prof. John B. 
Smith had recorded some observations which seemed to contra 
dict the statement made by Dr. Howard that the larvae of Culex 
did not stay under water longer than one minute, but came fre 
quently to the surface to breathe. Having doubts as to the cor 
rectness of Prof. Smith's determination of the larvas, he sent to 
him for specimens. The first lot received was Culex piifigens 
while the second and following lots were Aedes. This latter 
genus, being possessed of tracheal gills, can breathe under water, 
and Dr. Howard had no doubt that all of the specimens observed 
by Prof. Smith to remain for any length of time under water be 
long to this genus. 

OCTOBER 24. 1901. 

The i6zd regular meeting was held at the residence of Mr. E. 
A. Schwarz, 230 New Jersey avenue N. VV. Dr. Dyar occu 
pied the chair, and the following members were also present: 
Messrs. Kotinsky, Caudell, Morris, Hay, Busck, Barber, Ash- 
mead, Gill, Heidemann, Patten, Schwarz, Currie and Benton. 
Mr. William R. Reinick, of the Wagner Institute of Science, 
Philadelphia, and Mr. W. V. W^arner, of Washington, D. C., 
were present as visitors. The name of Mr. A. A. Doolittle, 
Central High School, Washington city, was proposed for mem 
bership, and he was elected. The resignations from correspond 
ing membership of Messrs. J. W. Tourney and William J. Fox 
were read and accepted. 

Under Short Notes and Exhibiton of Specimens, Mr. Caudell 
showed blown larvas of ants, ant lions, and various other insects, 
which are not usually inflated, prepared by himself. A discus- 



32 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

sion followed as to the relative value, for purposes of study, of 
alcoholic and inflated larvae. Mr. Schwarz considered alcoholic 
preservation best for coleopterous larvae, while Dr. Dyar said 
that in the Lepidoptera inflated specimens were by far the best. 
Speaking of ants, Mr. Ashmead recommended for study the 
papers on these insects by Prof. Wheeler, of the University of 
Texas. 

Mr. Schwarz exhibited the work of a Scolytid beetle (presum 
ably Dendroctonus approximattis Dietz) in portions of the bark 
of Pinusponderisa, illustrating how quickly a tree may be killed 
by this pest. These specimens were obtained at Flagstaff, Ari 
zona, during the past summer. This species is the only one 
which is fatal to the pine in that locality, the other Scolytidas 
producing only secondary injury. 

Mr. Schwarz also reported that Mr. Barber and himself had 
taken two species of Myrmecophilous Staphylinidae at Las Vegas, 
New Mexico, last summer, in the nests of Liometopum species. 
These were described by Wasmann in Wiener Entomologische 
Zeitung, XX, pp. 145 to 147, 1901, as Dinardilla liometopi, and 
Apteronina schmitti, new genera and species, from specimens 
collected at Cotopaxi, Colorado, by Prof. Jerome Schmitt. 

Mr. Heidemann showed two adults and a larva of the Coreid 
bug Stachyocne?nus apicalis Dallas, collected by him last August 
in a sandy field near Washington cit} 7 . This species, though of 
wide distribution, having been recorded from Florida, Texas, 
Mexico, Dakota, Colorado, and Missouri, has not before been 
reported from the District of Columbia, and may be considered 
as quite rare. 

Mr. Hay showed one specimen of the butterfly Neonympha 
gemma Hubner, which was taken by him in Nickajack Cave, 
Tennessee. This seems to be the first butterfly recorded from a 
cave. 

In regard to the Tree Crickets, Mr. Caudell stated as his 
opinion that the common and injurious species in the northern 
States was (Ecanthus fasciattis Fitch, not niveus Serville. 

Dr. Dyar exhibited specimens of the moths and larvae of 
Triprocris smithsonianus Clem., and presented a description of 
the larva, the first larva of the genus to be described, as follows :

DESCRIPTION OF THE LARVA OF TRIPROCRIS SMITH- 
SONIANUS CLEMENS. 

By HARRISON G DYAR. 

Found at Salida and Otis, Colorado, July 25th. 
"Pyromorphid shaped, rounded, flattened elliptical. Head rounded, 
bilobed, elongate, the clypeus touching the large membranous vertical 
triangle, shining brown, sutures darker; entirely concealed in the hood 
of joint 2. Hood hairy. On joints 3 and 4, five warts; on 5 to 12, four 
warts; on 13 a large diffuse wart. Subdorsal warts V-shaped, the lateral 
oblique, lower subventral small, the rest large, low. pale whitish, many 
haired with short brownish black-tipped bristles and a few longer pale 
hairs; only one or two such from the upper two warts. Diffuse black 
lines dorsal, lateral, stigmatal and subventral, all the rest of the space be 
tween the warts shaded in pale brick red, except along warts iv-f-v where 
whitish prevails. Feet on joints 7 to 10 and 13, normal, short, with a 
few hairs outwardly. Spiracles round, pale, conical centrally. At ma 
turity the dorsal black band was widened intersegmentally, with paired 
white, glandular spots in the position of depressed spaces (i) of the Coch- 
lidiidae, white-edged, the edge passing through the center of warts 
i+ii ; below this a pale salmon-colored band ; lateral black line narrow, 
waved, white edged; a narrow salmon line; stigmatal black band dotted, 
broadly white below; subventral black line dotted, without distinct white 
edging; venter pale, thorax ventrally and feet orange; traces of a broken 
ventral black line. 

Cocoon in the ground or leaves, white, of flocculent silk, 
opaque, flattened, as usual in the group. 

Food plant: Allionia nyctaginea, kindly determined bv Mr. 
C. L. Pollard. 



Mr. Schwarz showed twigs covered with some unknown 
kind of insect eggs, collected by him at Williams, Arizona, last 
July. Mr. Pergande, he said, had found a single larva among 
them which was pretty certainly that of a Dipteron (perhaps a 
species of Asilus according to Mr. Pergande). 

Mr. Morris stated that during the past summer he had ob 
served at two places on Stein's Mountains, Southeastern Oregon, 
swarms of a Locustid (Anabrus purpurascens Uliler). They 
were defoliating everything in their path, even the kt salt-bushes." 
The larger swarm covered an area of about one hundred square 
yards. 

A paper submitted for publication by Prof. A. D, Hopkins 
was then read by title. It is as follows ;

Type of genus, Erineophilus schwarzi described from 18 speci 
mens (n ?? and 7 cTc?), submitted by Mr. E. A. Schwarz. 
Two specimens of each sex were dissected, the remaining 9 9 9 
and 5 cfcT are in the type series, two retained by the author, and 
the others, including the c? and ? types, are in the National 
Museum Collection (No. 6242). 

The species upon which this genus is founded may be further 
described, as follows: 

Erineophilus schivarzi sp. nov. 

Female type (Gocoanut Grove, Fla., April 26). 

Length, 1.7 mm.*; color, yellowish-red ; posterior portion of prothorax 
to abdomen, darker; head and ventral surface dark; legs and antennae 
yellow. Head with front convex, middle of convex surface polished, 
shining, densely fringed with long yellow hairs, which extend around the 
anterior margin almost concealing the epistoma and mandibles. .Head 
withdrawn so that posterior portion cannot be seen. Base of prothorax 
emarginate. Posterior portion of proepisternum shining. Elytra shining, 
margined at base, surface glabrous, except on sides which are faintly 
and sparsely pubescent ; striae punctured but not impressed, interspaces 
not elevated and with median row of punctures slightly smaller than 
those of the striae; declivity not steep, smooth, punctures fine, apical 
margin slightly retuse, exposing the pygidium ; ventral segments i and 2 
distinctly punctured. 

Male type (Cocoanut Grove, Fla., September 25).

equals description of 9 ' in a ll respects except the 
head, which has the front convex, smooth, sub-opaque, faintly punctured 
and with faint median line; epistoma clothed with long hairs, extending 
over base of mandibles. 

\ 

The characters here defined vary but slightly in the other exam 
ples before me. The ^^ are generally smaller and vary more in 
size. When exposed the posterior portion of the head is found 
to be sub-opaque and punctured to vertex. The elytral striae and 
interspaces are slightly more distinct in some examples than in 
others. 

Systematic Position of the Genus. 

This genus seems to represent a distinct group coming between 
Blandford's groups Scolytides and Hex^colides. These three 
groups may be distinguished as follows : \\J 

A. "Anterior tibiae produced at the upper apical angle beyond the tar- 
sal insertion into a mucro, or bifid process " (Blandford); upper border 
unarmed. Third joint of tarsi bilobed. 

SCOLYTIDES. 
(Scolyti.) 
(Comptoceri.) 
(Bothrosterni). 

B. Anterior tibiae strongly produced at the upper apical angle into an 
upward curved process; upper border armed. Third joint of tarsi not 
bilobed. 

ERINEOPHILIDES. 
(Erineophili.) 

C. "Anterior tibiae not produced beyond the tarsal insertion" (Bland.)

The declivous asperated pronotum concealing the head from 
above indicates affinites with Tomicides, but the mouth parts, 
tibiae, tarsi, widely separated anterior coxae, and exposed pygidium 
furnish characters which separate it from this and all other 
groups as at present recognized. 

I am under obligations to Mr. E. A. Schwarz for the privilege 
of describing this interesting genus and species. He also sug 
gested the generic name. 



In discussing the paper Mr. Schwarz said that this species was 
of economic importance, as it bored under the bark of branches 
of the Banyan trees (JFfctts), thus killing them. 

The first paper read was that of Dr. Dyar, entitled : 

A NEW FORM OF CLISIOCAMPA FROM COLORADO. 
By HARRISON G. DYAR. 

Clisiocampafragilis, the common species of this genus in Col 
orado, feeds upon a variety of plants, including wild cherry, rose 
and aspen, occasionally, but not normally, on the oak. A larva 
was met with sparingly in the Platte Canyon near Denver, Col 
orado, feeding exclusively on the oak and differing in habits and 
coloration from the common form. Later it was seen in abun 
dance at Sedalia, Colorado. The species is nearly allied to the 
Californian C. constricta Stretch. 

The eggs were found on the lower twigs of the dwarf oaks 
in small rings without any covering; these were eggs of the pre 
vious season. The larvae fed at first in colonies, spinning no tent, 
only just enough web to hold them to the branches as with C. 
disstria of the Atlantic States. Later they wandered separately 
in search of the young leaves which were all they would eat. The 
larva has a black head, blue powdered in the sutures. The body 
is as usual, short haired, the lateral tufts as in constricta but more 
reddish, less contrasting. Orange markings well developed, 
consisting of a dorsal band constricted at the anterior third of the 
segment, marked with black and obscurely blue centered ; a sub- 
dorsal and a lateral line, practically continuous, running into pale 
orange transverse mottling in the incisures; traces of substigma- 
tal orange. Blue markings reduced ; two lateral patches, the pos 
terior one a transverse line cut by the subdorsal band ; subventral 
region washed in pale blue. The black ground color on.the sides, 
especially of joints 3, 4 and 12, appears as conspicuous transverse 
lines. Hairs reddish, scarcely tufted dorsally, orange or white 
on the sides. 



OF WASHINGTON. 39 

The moths differ in color in the sexes as with C. constricta. 
The male is pale, two brown, narrow lines on the fore wings, the 
hind wings more or less shaded with brown. Female brown, 
two dark paler-edged lines on fore wings, the hind wings brown 
shaded. There is more of a yellowish tint to the wings than in 
C. constricta, the brown irroratirig scales offering more contrast 
to the ground color. 

We would call this species, or local race of the Californian 
species, Clisiocampa tigris from the striped markings of the 
larva. 



Eggs, larvae and imagoes were exhibited. Mr. Caudell thought 
this species was of some economic importance, as it defoliated 
the scrub oaks. Dr. Dyar said it was reported to him as com 
mon some years, other years less so. 

The second paper was then presented by Mr. Schwarz, entitled, 
"The Coleoptera of semi-Tropical Florida." 

The beetles of semi-tropical Florida were twenty years ago 
estimated at 500 species. Now, however, 1,500 species are 
known from there, of which 227, representing 182 genera, are 
characteristic. The semi-tropical fauna is found in isolated spots 
on the east and west coasts of Florida, on some of the Keys, and 
through the West Indies, Venezuela, and Yucatan. This fauna 
embraces two families not found elsewhere, 157 species of wide 
distribution, 61 species belonging to the Austroriparian region, 
and 44 not found outside of the peninsula of Florida. Of these 
last, twenty-three ohly belong to the semi-tropical fauna. He 
compared this fauna with that of Baja California. 

The paper was discussed, by several of the members. Mr. 
Ashmead referred to the term " precinctive species," used by 
Dr. David Sharp in the sense of " characteristic." Mr. Schwarz 
thought "characteristic" a better term. 



NOVEMBER 14, 1901. 

The 1 63d regular meeting was held at the residence of Mr. 
Wm. H. Ashmead, 1807 Belmont avenue N.W. President Dyar 
occupied the chair. The other members present were Messrs. 
Schwarz, Pratt, Stiles, Benton, Patten, Barber, Heidemann, 
John B. Smith, Howard, Kotinsky, Busck, Caudell, Currie, 



40 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

Doolittle, Sanderson, Ashmead, and Quaintance. Messrs. F. A. 
Merrick, H. T. Fernald, Franklin Sherman, Jr., C. B. Simpson, 
and William G. Dietz, were in attendance as visitors. 

Mr. Franklin Sherman, Jr., of Raleigh, North Carolina, was 
nominated for corresponding membership, and Mr. C. B. Simp 
son, of the U. S. Department of Agriculture, for active member 
ship. The resignations of Mr. Frank E. Chapin and Mr. Theo. 
Holm, both on the list as active members, were received and 
accepted. 

Under the head of Short Notes and Exhibition of Specimens, 
Dr. Howard mentioned the larva of a grain moth, Pyrausta 
farinalis Linne, which had been sent him from a place out west 
in material said to have been voided by a child. Dr. Stiles then 
reported upon other matter found in the same material. This, 
he said, after some study and conjecture, proved to be partially 
digested cells of the banana, although possessing a superficial 
resemblance to segments of the tape- worm, Diplidium caninum. 
A half dozen similar cases had previously been referred to the 
Agricultural Department. 

Mr. Heidemann exhibited some seed pods of the sycamore 
upon which were eggs of the Lygaeid bug, Belonochilus nu- 
menius Say, together with alcoholic larvae and eggs of the same. 
They were all on the under side of the pods, some of them seem 
ing to be parasitized. 

Mr. Merrick showed several specimens of the moth Pseu- 
danaphora mora Grote, taken by him at New Brighton, Penn 
sylvania, on October 12 of this year, and a specimen of an unde 
termined species of Noctuid, no doubt strayed from the West 
Indian or Central American fauna, captured by him at the same 
place on August 5. 

Mr. Schwarz exhibited specimens of a Coccinellid beetle 
Exochomus (Axion) plagiatus Olivier, found feeding upon a 
species of Lecanium on oak (Quercus arizonicus) at Prescott, 
Arizona, on the i9th and 2oth of last June. This beetle was 
described from Mexico without more definite locality, and its 
exact home is therefore not known. Since the species occurs in 
enormous numbers of specimens, Mr. Schwarz thought it could 
be used for transportation into the olive orchards of Southern 
California as a natural enemy of the Black Scale (Lecanium 



OF WASHINGTON. 41 

olecz}. Dr. Howard said that he considered this an important 
discovery, and this beetle's utility in combatting the Black Scale 
should be tested, as no remedy for this pest had yet been found. 
Prof. Smith remarked that Exochomus tripustulatus fed in some 
numbers upon the San Jose Scale in New Jersey. 

Dr. Stiles called the Society's attention to the fact that the 
Florida University last summer conferred upon Mr. Ashmead 
the master's degree in recognition of the importance and excel 
lence of his scientific work. 

Dr. Dyar showed a co-type of Chionobas katahdin, recently 
described from Mt. Katahdin, Maine, by Mr. H. H. Newcomb 
(Ent. News, XII, 206, 225, plate 12, 1901), presented to the 
National Museum by Mr. Newcomb. With it specimens of 
C. norna, its varietyy^//^, C. taygete and C\ semidea for com 
parison, and a series of specimens collected by Mr. W. J. Peters 
on the north side of the Koyukak river, Alaska. C. katahdin, 
on the upper surface, does not differ from C. norna. Below it 
is darker than norna, the band and strigulation more diffuse, 
approaching semidea, and with distinct Sub marginal dots as in 
the specimen of taygete shown. These so-called species seem 
to be forms of one true species, as the series from Alaska indi 
cates. This series shows xforms that may be referred to full a, 
taygete, and semidea, yet they intergrade in a suspicious manner 
as if they were but variations of one type. C. katahdin, how 
ever, doubtless holds true to its own slightly divergent form in 
its circumscribed locality, and it is a matter of opinion whether it 
be referred to as an isolated local form or as a species. There 
seem in any case too many names for the American forms of 
Chionobas. C. katahdin is not the only form, collected from 
an isolated locality, that has received a name. The following 
table associates them in what may be a natural order. The last 
ten "species" are very poorly separated and may have to be 
ultimately united. The names of the species are following 
Skinner's recent catalogue which differ somewhat from those on 
Edwards' magnificent plates :

In this connection the subject of variation and geographical dis 
tribution was discussed by Mr. Schwarz and others. 

Mr. Currie exhibited two specimens of the dragonfly Sympe- 



Not seen.

trum rubicundulum (Say), collected by him on November 7 on 
the mainland opposite Plummer's Island, Maryland, between the 
canal and the river. Several specimens were seen, of which these 
were the only two captured. They were flying over, and in the 
neighborhood of, some small swampy pools fed by a spring, and 
one was observed to go through the motions of ovipositing. This 
seemed a rather late date for dragonflies to be flying in this locality. 

Prof. Smith said he had found dragonflies of this species after 
the I5th of October, and after a frost, in the cranberry bogs of 
New Jersey. Mr. Sanderson said he had also found this species 
in Delaware late in October, and Dr. Howard mentioned having 
collected other species at Boise, Idaho, on the 2ist and 25th of the 
same month. 

Dr. Dyar exhibited a lepidopterous larva, cocoon and moth, 
concerning which he read the following paper : 

A LEPIDOPTEROUS LARVA ON A LEAF-HOPPER. 

{Epipyrops barberiana n. sp.) 
By HARRISON G. DYAR. 

Mr. E. A. Schwarz has handed me a lepidopterous larva, co 
coon and moth, of which species he found two examples at Las 
Vegas Hot Springs, New Mexico. One larva fell into his beating- 
net from pine (Pinus ponder osa], and the other was taken by Mr. 
H. S. Barber, attached to a leaf-hopper which Mr. Heidemann 
says is Issus species, near auroreus Uhler of the Fulgoridae, 
occurring on the same tree. Mr. Barber states that the larva was 
firmly attached on the dorsal surface of the abdomen under the 
wings, and it required some force to remove it, but he did not 
observe any attaching membrane. Mr. Schwarz at first took it 
to be a species of Coccid allied to Dactylopius from its general 
appearance. 

Prof. J. O. Westwood has published (Trans. Ent. Soc., Lond., 
519, 1876) an account of a lepidopterous insect living on Fulgora 
candelaria at Hong Kong, China, from material collected by 
Mr. J. C. Bowring, and deposited in the British Museum. He 
named it Epipyrops anomala, new genus and species, and placed 
it in the Arctiidae. The larva was stated to be covered with a 
cottony coat, causing it to resemble a Coccus. Later (Trans. 
Ent. Soc., Lond., 433, 1877), Prof. Westwood again referred to 
this insect, and cited instances of an analogous, if not identical, 
species (not bred) observed by Lieut-Col. Godwin Austen upon 
Aphana species (Fulgoridae) in the Dillrang Valley, and by Mr. 



44 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

Wood-Mason upon Rurybrachis spinosa (also Fulgoridae) from 
a specimen belonging to the Madras Museum. It was supposed 
that in all these cases the larvae fed upon the waxy matter secreted 
by the Fulgorids. In the last instance, the larva was observed to 
be attached to its host by a white membranous band on the dorsal 
surface of the abdomen, but the exact nature of this band was 
not determined. 

The genus Epipyrops, originally referred to the Arctiidaa, was 
placed in the Liparidae by Kirby (Cat. Lep. Het., i, 490, 1892), 
and in the Limacodidae by Sharp on the opinion of Hampson 
(Cambridge Nat Hist., vi, 404, 1899). I know of no other 
published references. 

Unfortunately Mr. Schwarz's single specimen is in very poor 
state, being both crippled and mouldy. The antennas, however, 
are well preserved, and bear remarkably long pectinations. I was 
able to make out the venation by sacrificing the wings on one 
side. The forewings have vein i moderate, apparently simple, 
\c present, strong outwardly : veins 2 to 3 evenly spaced, remote ; 
4 and 5 rather close together, 6 and 7 equally spaced, 8 and 9 
more close together, arising from the longest part of the cell, 10 
and ii equally spaced, arising from the cell toward the end, 12 
free from the base. Hind wings apparently with three internal 
veins, though this part of the wing is crumpled ; vein 2 from 
the middle of the cell, 3 well separated, 4 and 5 close together 
but not so close as on the forewings ; 6 and 7 well separated, the 
cell well rounded, its upper vein weak ; vein 8 from the base, 
free ; male frenulum a single sharp, tapering, straight spine. 
The head and legs are covered by hyphae of mould, but appear 
to be as in Epipyrops, the palpi very small, the legs without per 
ceptible spurs. Thus this insect agrees generically with Epipy 
rops as far as can be seen. A considerable portion of the wings 
has been denuded of scales. Those that are left are blackish, 
with pale tips, forming a grizzled gray, apparently uniformly 
over the wing; hind wing blackish brown. Expanse of wings 
about 8 mm. I propose to call the species Epipyrops barberiana 
in honor of Mr. H. S. Barber, who capably assisted Mr. Schwarz 
in his valuable explorations in Arizona and New Mexico, and 
who found this insect in its natural position. 

The larva, preserved in alcohol, is nearly hemispherical, a 
little elliptical, flat along the ventral surface, very evenly arched 
dorsally. The head is rather large, retractile. Thoracic feet 
normal in number but very short and reduced, though perfectly 
visible. Abdominal feet represented by rather large, complete, 
ellipses of crochets on segments 4 to 6, and a more distinct, pro 
truded pair of feet on the last segment. The segments are short, 
contracted, furnished with a considerable number of minute sec 
ondary hairs, the ordinary tubercles indistinguishable. Mr. 



OF WASHINGTON. 45 

Schwarz states that in life the larva was covered by a white waxy 
secretion which is now dissolved by the alcohol. The secretion 
of the host has likewise disappeared, both in the alcoholicand the 
dry specimens, but Mr. Schwarz thinks that it was originally 
present. The color of the larva is destroyed by the alcohol, but 
it was an obscure whitish. All these characters agree with 
Epipyrops anomala. 

As to the systematic position of this insect, I cannot agree with 
any published opinion. That of Sir George Hampson, referring 
it to the Limacodidas is the most reasonable, but is negatived, 
among other characters, by the structure of vein S of the hind 
wings and by the abdominal feet of the larva. It is a Tineoid 
form, apparently not referable to the Tineidae proper. Mey- 
rick's tables seem to place it in the Zeuzeridaa, Hampson's in the 
Dalceridae ; but it will probably prove deserving of separate 
family rank. 

[Dr. Howard has since called my attention to a note (Proc. Ent. 
Soc. Lond. , p. xx, 1883) recording this genus from Central 
America, but the larvaB were apparently not bred. The note is 
by Mr. Champion and states that Iarva3 were not infrequently 
found attached to and feeding on the white cottony secretion so 
abundant about some of the smaller Fulgoridae. As many as 
three larvae had been seen attached to one imago. The Fulgori 
dae were very sluggish in their habits.] 



Mr. Benton called attention to a particular in which, he had 
observed, the Cyprian variety of bees differ in their habits from 
native and Italian varieties. Instead of driving out and killing 
all drones at the end of the honey harvest, they kill about four- 
fifths of them and permit the others to go back into the hive, 
only gradually destroying these, and, in some instances, permit 
ting a few to live over the entire w r inter, even in colonies nor 
mally supplied with queens. 

Dr. Dyar then presented the following paper : 

NOTES ON MOSQUITOES ON LONG ISLAND, NEW YORK. 
By HARRISON G. DYAR. 

Tnese observations were made at Bellport and Amagansett. 
The village of Bellport is on the south shore of Long Island, about 
the middle of the length of the island on Great South Bay. The 
land is flat and sandy, cut by sluggish streams forming lakes and 
pools. The bay is strongly brackish but without salt marshes in 
this vicinity. Mosquitoes were abundant in the season of 1901. 



46 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

The woods and grass swarmed with Culex sollicitans and C. 
cantans, while Culex and Anopheles entered the house in some 
numbers in spite of screens. Larvae were found in various situa 
tions, as will be described in detail in the following notes. No 
larvae were seen, however, in any body of water large enough to 
be roughened by the wind, nor in any water so shaded by the 
woods as to be dark. Several suspicious looking pools hidden 
in the dark woods were barren of mosquito larvae, though the 
adults swarmed there as they did almost everywhere else. 

Anopheles crucians Wied. 

This was the commonest Anopheles in the house, though not 
bred from collected larvae. Several examples were taken in the 
act of biting. 

Anopheles punctipennis Say. 

Not common as adult, though the larvae occurred in numbers 
with the following species in nearly equal proportion. Dr. 
Howard states in his publications on mosquitoes that the larva 
differs from that of maculipennis, "chiefly in the markings of the 
head." I was not able, however, to differentiate them by this or 
any other very definite character. The Anopheles larvae occur 
in two forms, one with the back spotted with white, the other un 
spotted. These were separated, but gave both species in nearly 
equal proportion. A puddle formed by rain at the side of the 
road contained a pure colony of punctipennis, and these were 
almost entirely of the white spotted form. This particular colony 
was entirely killed by the drying of the puddle shortly after I had 
collected from it. A similar puddle near Washington, D. C., 
contained this species, unmixed. 

Anopheles maculipennis Meig. 

The larvae occurred more or less commonly in nearly every pool 
and pond, and even in the blacksmith's rain-water barrel. A few 
could be found along the stagnant margins of swiftly flowing 
streams. A. punctipennis usually occurred mixed, in fact it was 
generally slightly the more abundant of the two. The Anopheles 
imagoes did not fly about the streams where their larvae occurred, 
at least they did not attempt to bite, whereas swarms of Culex 
occurred in such localities, especially C. sollicitans, whose breed 
ing places were miles away. The maculation of the Anopheles 
larva varies from none to a few dots or a complete band of white 
pigment down the back. This pigment is in the skin, and is often 
very white like porcelain. The larvae seem darker as a rule than 
punctipennis, and the white spots, when present, are more con 
trasted. The heads seem to me to be practically identical. 



OF WASHINGTON. 47 

Culex sollicitans Walk. 

Abundant everywhere; the most common mosquito. They 
were very troublesome except at the actual breeding places, where 
they were scarcely more fierce than house flies. Apparently 
they are not prepared to bite immediately after emergence. The 
breeding places of this mosquito were not found till near the end 
of my stay, so that I had begun to think I should not find them 
at all. However a place was found at Amagansett where the 
species bred in swarms. The land behind the beach at this point 
is low and had been flooded at some time previously by high 
waves ; subsequent rains had diluted this water. The swampy 
pool which it formed, full of grass, was examined on September 
1 6th. It was at that time scarcely perceptibly brackish to the 
taste. It contained many pupae and a few well-grown larvae ; no 
young ones. The grass in and about the pool fairly swarmed 
with freshly emerged sollicitans. A heavy rain had occurred the 
previous day so that the pool was evidently more diluted than it 
had been and it was too fresh for normal breeding. Of the ex 
amples carried home those at first emerging were all sollicitans, 
but the later ones were cantans. I did not at this time differ 
entiate the larvae of these species. They must be very similar. 
The adult must fly considerable distances. It was noted at Yap- 
hank, which is three miles from the bay and over six miles from 
the ocean. It was only somewhat less common than cantans 
at that place, and I should judge it capable of reaching the mid 
dle of the island (15 miles). Since writing the preceding re 
marks, Prof. J. B. Smith has loaned me some larvae that he is 
sure are sollicitans. They are indeed very similar to my can- 
tans. The hairs are a little shorter, the air tube also shorter, be 
ing scarcely more than twice as long as wide, and the lateral 
comb of the eighth abdominal segment consists of fewer, slightly 
more irregularly shaped spines ; lout the characters are so slight 
that I am doubtful if they can be used in practical differentia 
tion. 

Culex cantans Meigen. 

Nearly as common as the preceding, and more troublesome 
and persistent in the woods, though less common in the ho'use. 
The larvae breed in fresh-water swamps formed by rain in low 
ly m g> g rassv places. A low place near the beach at Bellport, 
located much as the one at Amagansett above referred to, but 
lying behind a higher bar of sand, was not reached by the high 
waves. It was dry on August 27th but was filled with fresh water 
by subsequent rains. On September I3th it contained many 
larvae in various stages of development, some of which pupated 
the following day. They emerged mostly cantans, though one 



48 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

example of sollicitans came out with the white ring on the pro 
boscis very small and a larva of territans was seen with the 
others. The larvae fed on the flocculent brown sediment at the 
bottom of the pool. Some transferred to jars converted all of the 
sediment included with them into pellets of frass in a few days. 
A fresh-water Hydroid occurred in the same pool and proved a 
serious enemy to the mosquitoes. A single example fastened it 
self to the side of the glass and devoured all of the larvae but one 
before it was noticed what was going on. It caught the larvae 
with its tentacles and digested them bodily. Some of the larvae 
were nearly covered with a little stalked Protozoon (Vorticella), 
but it seemed to do them no obvious harm. 

Culcx t&niorhynchus Wied. 

Not common, though several were taken, both out of doors 
and in the house. The larva was not met with. 

Culex pipiens Linn. 

This species, bred commonly in every rain-water barrel, bucket, 
or old tin can in the town, and apparently nowhere else. The 
larva was not seen in any of the natural bodies of water. The 
fly entered the house to some extent, but was not much trouble 
out of doors, except on the porch, and even there sollicitans was 
the more persistent. The larvae feed upon bacteria. A dish of 
water which was turbid and foully smelling was quickly cleared 
and all odor destroyed by these larvae. Some were introduced 
into water from which a number of cantans larvae had just been 
removed, intending them as food for the Hydroid; but they all 
died in a few hours without any obvious reason. Apparently 
they cannot live in water fit for cantans, which lived in this 
same water for weeks afterward. There seems no reason to 
doubt but that this species is really the European C. pipiens Linn. 

Culex territans Walk. 

This was identified for me by Mr. Coquillett, as were all the 
species. It was previously known to him onlv bv Walker's de 
scription, and there seem to have been no specimens in American 
collections. The fly was not common, and looks very much like 
pipiens, so that it would have been hard to identify it in the 
field. The larvae prefer cold water. A cold spring, forming a 
pool about 20 feet in diameter, contained numbers of these 
larvae, with a few Anopheles ; a rather cold lake formed by a dam 
in a small stream overhung by trees contained some larvae with an 
abundance of Anopheles and a very few Uranotaenia. They were 
not found in a warm, scummy pool, which yielded the other 
species freely. The larva is distinct from the other Culex here 
noted by the peculiarly colored antennae, white in the middle 
and blackish at the base and tip. 



OF WASHINGTON. 49 

The larvae of the above four species of Culex resemble each 
other in general structure. They differ in several minor char 
acters. Pip lens and territans agree in having a long, slender 
breathing tube, that of territans being especially long, and in 
the position of the antennal tuft, well developed at the outer third 
of the joint. They differ in the broad head of territans with the 
antennae distinctly banded with white and the narrower head of pi- 
piens with pale luteous or infuscated, unbanded antennae. Sollici- 
tans and cantans agree in the shorter conical or fusiform breath 
ing tube, the antennae blackish at the outer half, with the tuft at 
the middle of the joint, often weak or invisible. They do not 
sensibly differ; certainly not in any readily appreciable character 
that I have been able to find. All the larvae from the Ama- 
gansett marsh had very short anal finger-shaped processes, while 
those from Bellport had them moderately long, but both colonies 
were mixed. Anyway, the length of the anal fingers is not a 
specific character. 

The habits appear to be correctly expressed as follows : 

Living in cold springs or lakes territans. 

Living in small confined bodies of rain water pipiens. 

Living in fresh water grassy marshes cantans. 

Living in saltwater grassy marshes sollicitans. 

Uranotccnia sapphirina O.-S. 

The larvae occurred rather commonly in a warm pool filled 
with green algae (Spirogyra) along with Anopheles. A few 
were found in the cold lake, as above noted. The little larvse 
remain mostly at the surface, not being easily disturbed. They 
float flatly, though below the surface film, and were several times 
mistaken for the Anopheles with which they occurred. The 
head is elongate and blackish brown, the hairs of the first two 
abdominal segments are long, the rest short and stellate. Alto 
gether the larva presents a good generic type, quite distinct from 
both Culex and Anopheles. The little adults caused no trouble 
and were not seen flying. I give a more complete description 
of this form in another place. (Jour. N. Y. Ent. Soc., ix, 179, 
1902.) 

Prof. Smith records this species as having been bred from the 
pitcher plant (Ent. News, xii, 189, 1901), but he informs me by 
letter that the published statement is an error and that he has not 
bred sapphirina. 

I exhibit, for comparison with the foregoing, drawings of 
Psorophora ciliata Fab., made from Dr. Howard's specimens 
which were loaned to me by Mr. Kotinsky, Aedes smithii Coq., 
from pitcher plant larvae obligingly sent to me by Prof. Smith, 
after whom the species was named, Stegomvia fasciata Fab., 
from larvae which I owe to the kindness of Dr. W. C. Reed, of 
the Army Medical Museum, and Culex; confinis Lynch, which I 



50 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

collected near Washington, D. C. Prof. Smith has also let me 
see larvae of Culex canadensis Theobald, which I cannot distin 
guish from C. cantans very sharply. The air tube is a little 
longer and slenderer, and the anal fingers are longer than the 
segment, but these characters seem varietal rather than specific. 

These drawings cover all the mosquito larvae known at the time 
of writing. It appears from Dr. Howard's book that Culex im- 
piger had been bred ; but I learn from Mr. Coquillett that this is 
an error, and that the flies bred by Mr. Pratt as there described 
(page 79) really belong to C. pipiens. I have myself examined 
Mr. Pratt's flies and agree with Mr. Coquillett. 

Finally, I show a drawing of a very curious larva without 
mouth brush, the antennas jointed on the upper surface of the head 
instead of on the sides, arid a lateral fringe on the widest part of 
the head. The last thoracic segment and first two abdominal 
ones bear lateral conical prolongations. The air tube is short, 
uniform ; anal segment with four short, often invisible, fingers, a 
paired dorsal and single ventral tuft ; no lateral comb on the 
eighth abdominal segment. Hairs of last thoracic and first two 
abdominal segments long, the rest shorter, but those of the eighth 
abdominal segment longer than the preceding ones. 

Mr. Coquillett has named this species Corcthra brakeleyi 
(Ent. News, xiii, 85, 1902). 

The following table presents the differences between our mos 
quito larvae in synoptic form. I have not included Corethra or 
Mochlonyx, genera belonging to the Culicidae, as the adults have 
no proboscis and are, therefore, not ''mosquitoes." Mochlonyx 
culiciformis is roughly figured by DeGeer without mouth brush, 
and with the curious bent antennas arising from the side of the 
head, not from the upper surface, as in our Corethra. The larva 
is said to float horizontally in the water, but it has a distinct 
breathing tube, not sessile as in Anopheles.

This communication occasioned much interest and was dis 
cussed at length by several of the members and others present. 
Mr. Kotinsky said he had reared larvae of Anopheles punctipennis 
from pools on Mount Pleasant, D. C. Some of the larvae were 
of a greenish color. Prof. Smith said that, in his experience, 
Anopheles bred everywhere. A. punctipennis was the common 
species in New Jersey. A. maculipennis was much less common 



52 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

and usually found mixed with punctipennis. He had found only 
one place where it occurred by itself. He also noted that some 
were green and that they varied all the way from this color to 
black. Green larvae were usually found in marshes where there 
was a good deal of surface vegetation or where the larvae were 
above the surface of submerged leaves. He also found it, in one 
place, in brackish water, this being the only record of this kind 
in the United States, though it has been reported breeding in salt 
ish water in Europe. Culex pipicns larvae, he said, when full 
grown, will stay under ice as long as eight hours without a chance 
of coming to the surface. C. canadensis is a woodland species 
found in cold springs. C. sollicitans is the commonest species 
in Southern New Jersey, and the only one observed in some locali 
ties. This species is sometimes carried a distance of at least forty 
miles from its breeding places. Aedes smithii, he thought, did 
not bite in New Jersey, though Dr. Howard said that the gentle 
man who collected it in Florida reported its biting badly. It lays 
its eggs in the leaves of the pitcher plant as they are just opening 
and when- no water has yet been deposited. 

Dr. Howard congratulated Dr. Dyar upon his contribution to 
the life-history of the mosquitoes. He was much interested in 
the larval differences shown, especially as between the various 
species of Culex. He alluded to the immense increase in the 
knowledge of these insects which had recently been gained, and 
the many important discoveries made during the past few months 
especially, many of them since the publication of his book on 
mosquitoes. He spoke of the important generic differences in the 
mouth-parts ; these were not mentioned by Dr. Dyar, but he 
thought they would prove useful in a table. Dr. Fernald gave 
an account of his experience with Corethra larvae. Many hydras 
were found in the jars where he had them breeding. They seemed 
to momentarily paralyze the larvae. 

As too short a time remained for the other papers to be read before 
the hour for adjournment, it was voted that Prof. Smith be invited 
to continue his remarks on the subject of mosquitoes. Doing so 
he explained how he knew that C. sollicitans is carried a distance 
of forty miles. Their appearance at certain places away from the 
salt water is dependent upon the direction of the wind, and the 
species has been found at least forty miles from its nearest breed- 



OF WASHINGTON. 53 

ing place. Its eggs and first larval stage were unknown to him. 
He said, further, that sollicitans would breed in water 25 per 
cent, more salt than the sea itself. Contrary to Dr. Dyar's obser 
vations, he had found C. pipiens breeding in almost all kinds of 
watered places except cold springs. In large bodies of water, 
agitated by the wind, mosquitoes did not breed except near shore 
where the water was smooth, yet here he had found them com- 
monlv. 



DECEMBER 5, 1901. 

The i64th regular meeting was held at the residence of Dr. C. 
W. Stiles, 1718 (^street, N.W., President Dyar in the chair. 
Theie were also present Messrs. Patton, Simpson, Barber, 
Quaintance, Cauclell, Schwarz, Kotinsky, Gill, Howard, Busck, 
Ashmead, Doolittle, Morris, Matthis, Benton, Currie, Stiles, and 
Richardson, members, and Mr. Martin visitor. 

The annual election of officers being then in order, the present 
officers were re-elected for the year 1902. The Society then 
voted that the chair appoint a new publication committee, as has 
been the custom for each new volume of the '"Proceedings." 
Dr. Dyar then appointed Messrs. Currie, Schwarz, Howard, and 
Ashmead to act with him on this committee. 

Under the heading Short Notes and Exhibition of Specimens, Mr. 
Kotinsky exhibited a large series of the Reduviid bug Milyas cine- 
tus Fabr., collected by him near Washington under the bark of 
the plane tree Platanus on November 10. They were grouped 
in large, compact clusters, the largest of these containing at least 
twenty five specimens. Mr. Schwarz remarked that he had also 
found this insect, as well as a species of Tingis and the beetle, 
Xylophilus brunnipennis Lee., grouped in a similar manner 
under the bark of this tree during the winter. 

Mr. Ashmead mentioned that Prof. Wheeler, in a recent 
number of the "American Naturalist," recorded the fact that 
workers in the genus Pheidole are parasitized by a worm belong 
ing to the genus Mermis. This greatly increases the size of the 
worker and causes it to bear some resemblance to the female. 
Wheeler proposed the term Macroergates for this form of para 
sitism.

Then followed the paper by Dr. Howard, entitled ''An Out 
line Sketch of a Long Trip." On the lyth of August last he 
had, with Mr. Clifton, left Washington for Denver, Colorado, to 
attend the meeting of the American Association for the Advance- 
ment of Science. Among the organizations which met there 
was the Association of Economic Entomologists. Their meeting 
was very interesting, and one of the principal features was the 
paper by Mr. Marlatt on " The Original Home of the San Jose 
Scale." Mr. Marlatt gave it as his opinion, founded largely 
upon his researches in Japan, that there is nothing to show that 
the San Jose Scale is indigenous to that country. This view 
was combatted by several of the entomologists in attendance at 
that meeting. A thorough exploration of Japan, made by Mr. 
Marlatt since that time, established the correctness of his asser 
tion which was, moreover, conclusively settled by his discovery 
of what is undoubtedly the true home of this pest in the northern 
part of China. Here it lives on native food-plants and is held in 
check by its natural insect enemies. 

About the first of September, Dr. Howard left Denver for 
Houston, Texas, where he met Mr. Hunter, and with him spent 
some time in that State investigating the Cotton-boll Weevil. 
The mesquite was first seen by him near Fort Worth. A trip 
was made to Austin to see Prof. Wheeler, who has been making 
such valuable contributions to the life-history and habits of the 
ants. Prof. Wheeler, however, was absent from there at that 
time and he did not see him. 

At San Antonio he took the Mexico National Railroad direct 
to Mexico City, where he intended to consult with Prof. Herrera, 
Entomologist of the Mexican Government, concerning the Morel- 
los Orange Fruit Worm. An interesting account was given of 
the country through which the railroad passed, especially that 
between Laredo and the city of Mexico. The occurrence of tree 
yuccas, mesquite, and giant cactus was mentioned in particular. 

After leaving Mexico City, where he found Prof. Herrera and 
spent some time with him, he took the Mexico Southern Rail 
road for Puebla and Oaxaca. Other characteristic plants were 
seen on this part of the journey, among them the century plant 
and cacti of various species, notably the magnificent organ cactus 
and the very large Opuntias. Most of the farm hands and labor-

ers in this section are Indians.- Oaxaca he found to be a very 
interesting city with some curious remnants of an old civilization, 
among which were the rude ox carts commonly used there. The 
Indians thereabouts are only partially civilized and are bad char 
acters, often committing robbery in the surrounding country ; 
collecting is, therefore, attended with danger. Through the 
kindness of a policeman, who pointed his revolver in a threaten 
ing manner at some of the Indians to keep them quiet and in posi 
tion, he was enabled to secure photographs of them. Fleas were 
extremely abundant in this country as he discovered to his cost. 

Owing to the almost incessant rains occurring in Mexico at 
that time of year (September) collecting was difficult. Among 
the insects obtained were a new species of Bombus, a Fulgorid 
(Acrcep/it'a) pronounced new (the egg masses of which were also 
collected), and an interesting and widely distributed earwig of 
good size, Sphingolabis tceniata Dohrn. An egg-mass of a katy 
did (Microcentrum species) , given him by Prof. Herrera, differed 
from those found in this country in that the eggs were laid almost 
perpendicularly to the surface of the leaf, instead of horizontally. 
In Oaxaca he found one entomologist who had quite a collection, 
and the Oaxaca Museum also contained a collection, which was, 
however, in very bad condition. 

Returning to Mexico City, he proceeded from there to El Paso, 
Texas, this time taking the Mexico Central Railroad. The coun 
try along this route is very similar to that on the Mexico National. 
From El Paso he went to Los Angeles, California, where he met 
Dr. A. Fenyes, Mr. H. C. Fall, and Mr. F. Grinnell, Jr. The 
mother of the latter gentleman was much interested in natural 
history objects, and among other things she had a living colony 
of the very poisonous spider Lathrodectus mactans as pets. On 
being told of the dangerous character of her pets she resolved 
after some hesitation, to have them killed. 

From Los Angeles he proceeded to Fresno. In the latter place 
he found the Smyrna figs well established, and a large crop had 
been gathered. San Francisco was the next point visited ; one of 
the most interesting things, in his opinion, found here is the 
beautiful little island of Belvidere in San Francisco Bay, with its 
unique and picturesque dwellings. Portland, Oregon ; Seattle, 
Washington, and Moscow, Idaho, were then visited in turn. At 



56 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

the latter place he met the entomologist, Prof. J. M. Aldrich, and 
was favorably impressed with his work. Boise City was stopped at 
briefly, and from there he passed through Wyoming and returned 
home. Dr. Howard's account of his trip was illustrated by many 
photographs taken en route of objects and places of interest. 

At the conclusion, questions were asked and discussion par 
ticipated in by Messrs. Doolittle, Gill, Kotinsky, Stiles, and 
Schwarz. Mr. Schwarz, speaking of the Chilocorus which preys 
upon the San Jose scale, said that C. similis, the form found in 
North China, was extremely like our C. bivzdnerus, in fact, almost 
indistinguishable, and more especially like the race of bivulnerus 
occurring in California. He recalled how C. bivulnerus, origi 
nally found on oak in Florida, transferred itself to the orange when 
orange culture began to become general in the central part of the 
peninsula. The beetle increased enormously, and aided very 
materially in keeping the scale in check. It was also said that 
the reason it was not of more benefit in more northern localities 
was because of its being a slow breeder.

While looking for mosquito larvae at Bellport, N. Y., the larvae 
or pupae of several other water inhabiting flies were noticed, 
some of which were bred. Mr. Coquillett has kindly named 
them for me. 
Tanypus dyari Coq. (Fig. 8.) 

Only the pupae were noticed. They occurred in the cold 
spring pool with Culex territans, and greatly resemble mosquito 
pupae. On comparing the figures it will be noted that they differ 
in many proportions from Culex, but when taken in the water 
the general resemblance was deceptive. They were, however, 
much larger than the Culex. They have the same habits, resting 
at the surface with the slender funnel-shaped, prothoracic air 
tubes penetrating the surface film and quickly descend when dis 
turbed. The anal paddles resemble those of Culex, but are more 
hairy.

Sepedon fuscipennis Loew. (Figs. 6 and 7.) 

These disgusting black maggots were not infrequent in the 
collection of dead plants, scum and floating matter at the dam in 
the cold lake and in the adjoining water. They rest and move 
below the surface, parallel to it, suspended by the four radiate, 
narrow plates with which the body terminates. These rest with 
the upper surface dry, and expose the spiracles to the air. The 
larval segments are distinctly ^-annulate, the color is blackish 
with waved black lines showing by transparency. The puparium 
floats in the water, resembling a seed. It is blackish above, 
whitish on the sides, with a lateral reddish stripe containing seg- 
mentary black dots ; below whitish gray, speckled with black 
dots.* 

Chironomus anonymus Will. 

These larvas were first noticed in the blacksmith's rain-water 
barrel. They are bright red in color, but usually remain in a 
tube formed of granular sediment united together. The material 
seems to be largely the excrement of mosquito larvae. They 
wriggle with a slow squirming motion continuously, apparently 
to aerate the tracheal filaments. The pupa also remains in the 
case, but wriggles with a different motion as it has to aerate the 
bunches of fine filaments on the prothorax. Shortly before the 
emergence of the imago it rises to the surface. 

Larva (Fig. i). Head a little higher than wide, flattened, rounded, ob 
lique ; clypeus large, triangular, high ; eyes in two small, angular patches ; 
antennae moderate, simple; labium distinct with two simple hairs; a few 
hairs on the surface of the head. Body slender, elongate, last two 
thoracic joints gently enlarged, subconsolidated. On ventral side of pro- 
thorax anteriorly a short bilobed process bearing a large tuft of slightly 
curved spines ; between the yth and 8th abdominal segments ventrally a 
group of long, thick, curving, subsegmented respiratory tubes ; a tuft of 
four small processes on the last segment ; a group of hairs at the dorsal 
tip ; anal tip conical, with a ring of curved spines.' Color bright coral red, 
translucent; alimentary canal whitish, more opaque. 

Pupa (Fig. 2). Head nearly free ; thorax small, the wing cases partly 
covering the long, coiled leg cases. A diffuse bunch of finely branching 
respiratory filaments on prothorax. Abdomen long, tapering, gently 
curved. 

Chironomus modes tus Say. 

These larvae occurred in cases similar to the preceding, but 
they lived in the masses of Spirogyra and under the Lemna leaves 
in the lake. They were much smaller and slenderer than the 
other species and pale whitish in color. The larva is without the

branchial filaments ; it wriggles in a similar manner, however. 
Probably its small size renders it possible to aerate the tissues 
completely through the skin. 

Larva (Fig 3). Head rounded, flattened, free but somewhat retracted; 
antennae slender, distinct; eyes of two contiguous black spots. Body 
slender, filamentous, undulatory. A ventral pad on the prothorax bear

dorsal, terminal, double tuft of hairs. Whitish, translucent, alimentary 
canal more opaque or blackish, according to food. 

Pupa (Fig. 4). Shaped as in the preceding species, the cases forming a 
moderate prominence. Abdomen slender, tapering, ending in a ventral 
lamellate projection, the last segment bearing a large tuft of colorless 
hairs. Translucent, pale greenish, the thorax yellowish, eye dark; wing 
and leg cases very transparent. A tuft of few, rather coarse, filaments on 
the prothorax. 

Ceratopogon varicolor Coq. (Fig. 5.) 

The pupa only was observed. It was floating upright with the 
air tubes penetrating the surface. The abdomen was straightly 
extended so that the stiff, spiny thing did not suggest the appear 
ance of a mosquito pupa at all.

The paper was discussed by Messrs. Ashmead, Howard, Stiles, 
and Gill. Dr. Howard mentioned the interesting observation, 
recorded by Mr. S. I. Smith, of New Haven, Connecticut, that 
Chironomus larvae had been found in Lake Superior at a depth 
of 600 feet below the surface of the water. Dr. Packard, Dr. 
Howard continued, had found larvae of some species of Chirono 
mus in salt water in Salem Bay. Dr. Howard noted further that 
Anopheles punctipennis had been found breeding in brackish 
water at the head of Chesapeake Bay. On his late trip he had 
found the burning of pyrethrum powder in his room very effective 
against mosquitoes. Culex pipiens was the only mosquito met 
with in Mexico, and this species, according to Prof. Herrera, was 
probably introduced thither from the lower Rio Grande Valley, 
Texas, at the time of the opening up of the Mexico Central Rail 
road.

THE CATTLE TICKS OF NORTH AMERICA. 

By CH. WARDELL STILES. 

{Author's Abstract.) 

Doctor Stiles presented before the Society the final proof sheets, 
with illustrations, of an article entitled the " Cattle Ticks (Ixodo- 
idea) of North America," prepared by Doctor Salmon and him 
self for publication in the Annual Report of the Bureau of Animal 
Industry. He discussed the various species briefly,' noting sev 
eral changes in the designation of some of the parasites in ques 
tion. Contrary to the views of Europeans, he is inclined to recog 
nize Boophilus as distinct from Rhipicephalus, and he called 
attention to the necessity of accepting the genus Boophilus as 
basis of quarantine hereafter against Texas fever, instead of the 
species Boophilus bovis. He brought out the interesting fact 
that the Boophilus of Cuba is distinct from the form which occurs 
in the United States, and apparently agrees with the species found 
in Australia. Heretofore there has been considerable difficulty 
in distinguishing between Dermacentor reticulatus and Derma- 
centor electus, better known as Dermacentor americamis. 
He stated that Dermacentor electus has nothing whatever 
to do with the original Acarus americanus, which is evi 
dently Amblyomma unipunctatum, and that it may be easily dis 
tinguished from Dermacentor reticulatus by the difference in 
the structure of the stigmata. In Dermacentor reticulatus the

stigmal plates are very coarsely punctate, while in Dermacentor 
electus they are very finely punctate. 

The paper contains analytical keys to all of the known species 
of ticks. 

The paper was discussed by Messrs. Schwarz, Ash mead, 
Howard, and Gill. Dr. Stiles also mentioned the curious resting 
stage of the ear tick Ornithodoros mcgnini, with figures illus 
trating it. It had, he said, once been described by an entomolo 
gist as an egg. Dr. Howard said that it resembled exactly the 
hypopus stage of Tyroglyphid mites.

ANNUAL ADDRESS OF THE PRESIDENT. 



THE COLLECTION OF LEPIDOPTERA IN THE NATIONAL 

MUSEUM. 

By HARRISON G. DYAR. 

I would ask your attention to the collection of Lepidoptera in 
the United States National Museum. It has been frequently 
pointed out in the annual reports of the Smithsonian Institution 
that it was eminently desirable that the United States Govern 
ment should possess as complete a scientific collection as could 
be made, worthy of this large and prosperous country. Not 
insignificant in such a collection would come the insects, both 
from their relative abundance in species and the great economic 
importance of many of them. The order Lepidoptera forms a 
considerable part of the aggregate, and to the history and present 



62 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

condition of the Governmental collection of this attractive order 
I would briefly invite your attention. 

Before 1876, when theNational Museum came into existence as 
a sequel of the Centennial Exposition at Philadelphia, the Smith 
sonian Institution was the depository of collections belonging to the 
Government. But it never amassed a collection of insects, nor had 
an entomologist on its staff'. In the early years, when Townend 
Glover was acting as entomologist for the U. S. Government, some 
material was collected, and there came in from the surveys for a 
a Pacific railroad, the Geological and Geographical Surveys and 
miscellaneous sources, sundry insects. This material became sub 
sequently entirely dissipated. Some of it was reported upon in 
Government publications by Stretch, Packard, Strecker, Grote 
and others, but the majority of the material seems to have re 
mained in the private collections of those so reporting. Certainly 
all that is at present left of the Lepidoptera in the Government's, 
possession are a few specimens returned at a recent date by Dr. 
A. S. Packard. 

In 1882 a department of insects was organized in the National 
Museum with Dr. C. V. Riley as honorary curator, without any 
assistance. The number of insects of all orders was estimated at 
1,000, of which, perhaps, 200 may have been Lepidoptera, a most 
insignificant figure. More specimens than this could be taken by 
an active collector in a single day. We may well consider that 
at this date the national collection of Lepidoptera first began. 

The first collection of any importance received was that of Dr. 
Riley. It was formally presented in 1885. It contained 17,000 
specimens of Lepidoptera, besides 3,000 larvas in alcohol and a 
few inflated larvas. All the material was North American, with 
the most trifling exceptions, and principally amassed by Riley 
himself from the Southern States. 

In 1886 Dr. J. B. Smith was appointed assistant curator. He 
brought with him his private collection, which was acquired by 
the National Museum by purchase. It contained a general collec 
tion of North American Lepidoptera most full in the family Noc- 
tuidas, Dr. Smith's specialty. I find no exact record of the num 
ber of specimens in the collection, though it probably approached 
15,000, and included the material of Mr. Meske, mostly collected 
about Albany, N. Y. During this time various smaller accessions 



OF WASHINGTON. 63 

were being received, principally through the Division of Entomol 
ogy of the Department of Agriculture, which has always been 
a steady, though never a copious, contributor to the collection. In 
1 886 the number of insects was estimated at 500,000. If one- 
fifth of these were Lepidoptera, the collection may have contained 
100,000 specimens, including duplicates, at this date, and may be 
considered to have become fairlv started, in charge of a Lepidop- 
terist, under the direction of the entomologist to the Department 
of Agriculture, with apparently the most favorable auspices. The 
geographical range covered was, however, strictly North Ameri 
can, excluding Mexico. 

An arrangement of the collection was begun by Smith an.d fin 
ished by Linell, who succeeded him in 1889, as far as the Micro- 
lepidoptera ; but with the increase in the total number of insects 
in the collection, which kept up at the rate of 15,000 specimens a 
year, without any concomitant increase in the museum force, less 
and less attention proportionately was paid to the Lepidoptera. 
Linell was not a Lepidopterist, aod, without assistance, could not 
be expected to do more than preserve the material from destruc 
tion. Consequently the collection fell into a state of virtual neg 
lect. 

In 1891 material began to be received from Dr. W. L. Abbott 
from Africa and Asia, and in 1892 the collection of G. Beyer, of 
New York, was received, 1,900 specimens, containing a series of 
European species. These were the first accessions of exotic 
materral of any importance, and formed the nucleus of an exotic 
collection. It was not, however, arranged at this time. 

There followed shortly the large collection of Japanese Lepi 
doptera through Prof. Mitsukuri, which had been on exhibition 
at the World's Fair at Chicago, further material from Dr. Abbott, 
and the collection of Mr. William Astor Chanler in East Africa, 
all of which remained stored in boxes and cupboards from lack 
of space to arrange it and of time by the single aid, Mr. Linell. 

In 1895 Dr. Riley died and was succeeded by Dr. L. O. Howard 
as honorary curator. Dr. Howard had a lively interest in the 
national collection, and a reorganization of the Museum staff' was 
effected,* whereby Messrs. Ashmead, Coquillett, Schwarz, and 
Currie were assigned to duty in connection with the insect collec-

64 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

tions. None of them had, however, any direct duty in connec 
tion with the Lepidoptera, which remained with Mr. Linell as a 
side issue. The collection gradually relatively declined till it was 
surpassed by that of many a private collector. Still the number 
of specimens continued to gradually increase. From the 100,000 
in 1886 it rose to about 117,000 in 1887, 119,000 in iSSS, and 
120,000 in 1889; but in 1894 the estimate is only a trifle over 
121,000. The effects of the unavoidable deterioration and waste 
had begun to be felt, and were scarcely overbalanced by the acces 
sions. During his administration, Dr. Smith had prepared an 
exhibition series of some extent with much care. This suffered 
the ultimate fate of all material exposed to the light, and so much 
of the Government's material disappeared. Other specimens 
were rendered worthless through sending them to the Tennessee 
Centennial Exposition in 1897. Besides, over half the number of 
specimens in the collection had all along consisted of duplicates, 
and some of these were naturally gradually disposed of. 

Mr. Linell died in 1897, and the same year the writer was ap 
pointed custodian of the Lepidoptera. The collection was found 
in general well preserved, though many duplicates were seriously 
infested with museum pests and had to be thrown away. In 
number of specimens the aggregate probably did not greatly ex 
ceed that of 1894. For a while the custodian worked alone, but 
later Mr. A. N. Caudell was assigned to assist during after 
noons. A separate room was provided by the Museum authori 
ties for the collection of Lepidoptera, and a complete rearrange 
ment was begun. 

Very considerable accessions of material now began to come 
in. American collectors became aware that a Lepidopterist was 
again in charge and they could give scope to their natural patri 
otic desires to see the national collection increased with the ex 
pectation that their donations would be received with interest and 
promptly labeled and arranged. The custodian brought a col 
lection of 15,000 specimens containing both native and exotic 
material with many inflated larvae and an amount of alcoholic 
material. This latter we have never counted, for the reason that 
it is practically a dead loss. Larvae in fluid soon become un 
recognizable from shrinking, hardening and discoloration ; the 
material is awkward to handle, dangerous to the collection from ac- 



OF WASHINGTON. ()5 

cidental loosening of the bottles, and troublesome to keep in order. 
All of the old Riley material, as well as the great number of bot 
tles filled from time to time at the Department of Agriculture are 
likewise nearly useless. We have lately concentrated our efforts 
on preparing inflated larvas, which, though more trouble to make 
at first, give ultimate satisfaction. Even for small rarvaB this 
method is preferable and we intend to completely substitute it for 
the placing of specimens in any kind of fluid. Doubtless some 
alcoholic material must be received from uninstructed or hurried 
correspondents, and even from some others whose conservatism, 
or possibly a different experience, leads them to prefer this method 
of preservation. 

In 1900, Dr. Ottmar Hofmann, of Regensburg, Germany, 
died. His collection consisted of two parts, his own material 
and a portion of the collection of Anton Schmid. Schmid had 
recently died, leaving his "Macros" to Mr. E. Frank, and his 
"Micros" to Dr. Hofnaann. The Hofmann collection proper 
was picked over by Lord Walsingham, who took away what he 
wanted in his special families. But the remainder and the Schmid 
" Micros," intact, came to the United States National Museum 
through the offices of Prof. A. R. Grote. Prof. Grote obtained 
the collection for us at a low price, and it was so purchased by 
the Museum. Thus was obtained a very full collection covering 
the European fauna. The families which Lord Walsingham had 
taken from the Hofmann material were duplicated from the 
Schmid 'collection, with the exception of one family, the Psych- 
idae. These were formerly classified as "Macros," so Schmid's 
specimens did not go to Hofmann. On the other hand, Lord 
Walsingham took Hofmann's Psych idas as they are now referred 
to the " Micros," his own special group. But, with this excep 
tion, the National Museum obtained by this very inexpensive 
purchase an admirable representation of the European Lepidop- 
tera throughout, the smaller Tineids being as fully represented 
and as carefully mounted as the large butterflies. The collection 
numbered over 15,000 specimens. The sendings of Dr. VV. L. 
Abbott continued, his last being from Lower Siam, comprising 
several thousand butterflies and moths of that region. These 
were gradually mounted and placed in their proper families. A 
large part of the butterflies were named, with the assistance of 



66 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

the late Dr. Herman Strecker, but most of the moths yet await 
identification. Several thousand South American moths of the 
commoner species were given to the custodian by Mr. Wm. 
Schaus, and have been distributed, but not fully named. The 
collection, as a whole, has been arranged, the duplicates separated 
and all tire named species catalogued by means of a card catalogue 
by specific names. The collection has the largest room of any 
of the orders of insects, and is the first one to be completely in 
stalled in the regular Museum drawers ; thanks to the interest and 
help of the assistant curator, Mr. W. H. Ashmead. It is as well 
housed as can be expected in the present Museum building. 

In the summer of 1901 I made an arrangement with Mr. Wm. 
Schaus whereby his large collection of American butterflies came 
into my possession and was placed on deposit in the Museum, 
with the intention of ultimately donating it. It contains 10,000 
specimens and fills nearly 200 drawers. The butterflies of both 
North and South America are very fully represented, and it con 
tains the types of 200 species described by Mr. Schaus, with 
those of a few described by Mr. Godman in the Biologia Centrali- 
Americana. 

Thus at the end of the year 1901 the National collection of 
Lepidoptera at last begins to show respectable proportions. 
There are now 99,500 specimens representing 12,1^0 species, with 
about 18,500 more specimens in the duplicate collection, 3,490 
inflated larvas, the types of 1,246 species and varieties, besides a 
great mass of alcoholic larvae, cocoons, eggs, etc. 

As compared with older collections, like that of the British 
Museum, it naturally appears still in its infancy. Of the families 
Syntomidce and Arctiidae, recently catalogued by Sir G. F. 
Hampson, the British Museum contains fully 75 per cent, of the 
world species. Our museum cannot count over one-sixth as 
many. The same proportion doubtless holds throughout most of 
the families of the moths. The butterflies would show somewhat 
more favorably. It should be remembered that but little support 
has been accorded the collection in a financial way. There is no 
fund for the purchase of specimens, and the salaried custodians 
have always been too few. Fortunately the Department of Agri 
culture has lent a continued and very essential aid. We recipro 
cate by the loaning of material and the services of the custodian 



OF WASHINGTON. 67 

in identification of insects, finding of synonymy, references to 
literature, etc. 

The duplicate collection had, for a long time, contained half of 
the total number of specimens, and is still large. It is somewhat 
of a problem what to do with it. We have practically abandoned 
making exchanges, because of the poor condition of a majority of 
the specimens, since all the good material is in the regular col 
lection. Most collectors will not receive what we have in ex 
change for their own fresh material, and many will not take it at 
all. Besides, the labor of making exchange lists and the time 
that would have been consumed would have largely prevented 
the work of installation that has been accomplished. The dupli 
cates are gradually being made available by school teachers and 
others, and it is intended to prepare from them a respectable 
public exhibit collection, and keep this replenished from the 
same source. At present there is practically no such exhibit, at 
least arranged with any system, but with the present support it is 
impossible to prepare one. 

The study and identification of the material has progressed to 
some extent, but the routine work of installation has prevented 
any very general work in that direction. Mr. August Busck, of 
the Department of Agriculture, has begun some studies on the 
American Tineids, which promise to be of material assistance to 
the collection. A catalogue of the Lepidoptera of North America 
is being prepared for publication, and it is intended to mark in 
this those species still lacking to the collection. We hope for 
considerable accessions from American collectors when they know 
exactly what is needed. 

It will be noticed that the collection of Lepidoptera experienced 
a period of activity at the beginning, followed by a period of 
stagnation, now again succeeded by one of activity. These active 
periods were synchronous with the presence of a Lepidopterist 
in charge. The deduction is general, and shows it to be highly 
advantageous that each order of insects should have a custodian 
especially interested in it. Even with the best intentions, one 
whose training and activities lie in another field can scarcely do 
more than keep a collection in a condition of preservation, not to 
speak of planning for its extension and arrangement and the seiz 
ing of all possible opportunities to secure material and interest 
others in it.

In 1892, Dr. J. B. Smith, ex-curator and a Lepidopterist, vis 
ited London, and secured a promise from a well-known gentleman 
of the gift of his collection, probably the largest in the American 
fauna, as a whole, in existence. But Dr. Smith was no longer in 
charge of the collection at Washington, which was entering upon 
its period of stagnation. General confidence in the national col 
lection as a fit repository for valuable material gradually waned. 
This was to a certain extent unjust, as the material was well cared 
for, though not actively elaborated. So, under advice of fellow 
entomologists, the promise lapsed and Mr. Schaus gave the whole 
of his non-American material to the American Museum of Natu 
ral History in New York. This museum had in charge a com 
petent curator actively interested in Lepidoptera. 

Within the last year only have Mr. Schaus' American butter 
flies been secured for Washington, but by an entirely new arrange 
ment 

It may not be out of place to notice the collection of Orthop- 
tera in the National Museum, because this so well illustrates in 
its present state the condition into which a collection falls without 
a specialist in charge. The Orthoptera are the only order of 
insects which have never been in charge of a specialist nor had 
any attention from a resident student. A part of the collection is 
in museum drawers, through the labors of Messrs. Linell and Cur- 
rie at odd times, but most is still in the old dangerous double 
book boxes and Schmitt boxes belonging to the Department of 
Agriculture. Museum pests have been very generally excluded, 
but the moving and removing of the boxes out of the way of more 
active collections has caused specimens to become loosened and 
fall about, creating considerable damage. No opportunity for 
repairs has been offered. The collection is, as a whole, sadly dis 
arranged. New material could not be incorporated from lack of 
time and from unfamiliarity with the classification of the order, 
so that each accession is separately placed in its drawer or set of 
boxes. Glaring errors in identification occur, species of different 
groups, superficially similar, being placed above the same label. 
There is no attempt at securing new material on a regular plan, 
the accessions being all by chance. What degree of order exists 
is mostly due to the study given certain groups by specialists to 
whom they have been loaned. But this method has disadvan-

tages. Most students keep material for an unconscionably long 
period during which the museum drawers are conspicuous by 
their emptiness. It is then subjected to the danger of damage or 
loss in transit, besides various vicissitudes while in the hands of 
the student, not to mention the occasional risk of unfair treatment 
at the hands of an overtrusted and presumably honest correspon 
dent. 

But the collection of Lepidoptera was never in so unfortunate 
a condition as this, and its future at present seems most promising. 

To consider the present condition of the collection in somewhat 
more detail, it at once appears that the number of specimens now 
present, approximately 121,000, exclusive of alcoholic material, 
pupae, eggs, etc., is not as much as would be expected from the 
figures quoted above. I have given 121,000 as the probable total 
in 1894, and since that date we have received over 50,000 speci 
mens in four of the largest accessions, besides many smaller ones. 
What has become of them ? 

In the first place, the 121,000 of 1894 included alcoholic larvae, 
as I suppose. Of these we have a great mass, as above stated, 
but probably not 50,000 ; 5,000 might be a conservative estimate. 
Secondly, the former estimates are probably grossly overstated.* 

I learn that no actual count was made, but that the yearly acces 
sions, as shown by the books, were added to the last year's esti 
mate for that of the following year. This method is not even 
theoretically correct, as it makes no account of exchanges, by 
which a number of specimens, approximately equal to the acces 
sion, actually leave the collection. Practically, also, it is faulty, 
since a considerable proportion of unsolicited accessions find their 
way atonce to the waste basket, besides which accidents and other 
unavoidable wastes occur. Thirdly, the estimates are given for 
the total number of insects, and I have taken one-fifth as the prob 
able proportion of Lepidoptera. This is not unlikely too high a 
proportion for the latter years with the great increase in the col- 



* There seems to be a general tendency to overestimate insect collec 
tions. The Neumoegen collection, when actually counted by Mr. Doll, 
was but half of the supposed amount. Dr. Skinner estimates the Strecker 
collection at 200000 (Ent. News, xiii, 2, 1902); but my own estimate, 
made in Dr. Strecker's presence, was 100,000, and I believe a very liberal 
one.

lection of Coleoptera. One-fifth was the proportion of Lepidop- 
tera in the Riley collection, and it is the proportion that the 
number of types of Leidoptera bears to the total number of types 
in the National Collection of Insects. But Riley was, by prefer- 
ference, a Lepidopterist, and therefore likely to have had more 
than a normal proportion of this order in his collection, while in 
the matter of types the Lepidoptera are possibly better off than 
other orders, owing largely to the generosity of Dr. J. B. Smith. 
It is proper to state that the last figures, now discussed, are based 
on an actual count, conducted by my assistant and myself. 

The arranged collection is housed in 1,113 drawers ; the un 
placed material and duplicates are in miscellaneous boxes. 

Excluding the duplicates and un worked material, which can 
not be satisfactorily discussed, and excluding also the Schaus col 
lection, which is intact, the butterflies comprise, in round num 
bers, 1^,600 specimens of 2,400 species, with 290 inflated larvae. 
There are but 29 types in this group. The North American fauna 
is well represented, especially in the larger species. The col 
lection is poorest in the Lycsenidaa and Hesperidae. The Schaus 
collection, when added, will nearly double the total number of 
specimens. The Sphingidae comprise 1,200 specimens of 250 
species, 100 larvae, but no types whatever. The Saturnians, 880 
specimens of 168 species, with 220 larvae and one type. The 
Arctians and allied families have 4,750 specimens, 860 species, 
460 larvas and 48 types. The Noctuidae, 16,800 specimens of 
2,370 species, with 550 larvae and 509 types. The North Amer 
ican Noctuids in the National Museum are probably the best col 
lection in existence in this field. One-half of the types belonging 
in the regular collection are in the Noctuidae. The Lasiocam- 
pidae, Liparidae and allied small families have 3,400 specimens of 
500 species, 690 larvae and 17 types, being especially rich in 
inflated larvae. The Geometridae have 8,700 specimens, 1,200 
species, 450 larvae and 103 types. The North American species 
are well represented on the whole, though a considerable number 
are missing. The Sesiidae, Limacodidae and other allied small 
groups have 2,580 specimens, 470 species, 170 larvae and 29 
types. The Pyralidse and Pterophoridae have 9,200 specimens 
of 1.370 species, 1 10 larvae and 47 types. A great many North 
American species are lacking in this group and the following,

probably 50%. The Tortriciclae have 4,900 specimens, 724 
species, 77 larvae and 33 types. The Tineidse (senslat.) have 
12.150 specimens of 1,800 species, 56 larvae, and 179 types. 
They are pretty well represented in some groups, though the 
series of specimens are too short. In larvas they are very defi 
cient, though fairly rich in types. Except in the European fauna, 
there are practically no exotic Tineids in the collection. Follow

At the conclusion of the address, it was discussed by several 
members present. 

Mr. Ashmead emphasized the necessity of having a custodian 
in charge of each order of insects. He paid a tribute to the faith 
ful and zealous work of Mr. Linell in caring for the collections, 
and mentioned some of the difficulties and drawbacks under which 
he labored. Much of the time he worked entirely unassisted, and 



72 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

it was thus obviously impossible for him to properly care for so 
large a collection, covering different orders. Mr. Ashmead also 
made a statement of the condition of the collection in other orders 
than Lepidoptera, mentioning in particular the Coleoptera and 
Hymenoptera, and referring to the enormous number of types in 
the latter greatly in excess of those in the Lepidoptera. 

The concluding paper was by Mr. C. B. Simpson, and was 
entitled : 

THE ALIMENTARY CANAL OF CERTAIN LEPIDOPTEROUS 

LARVAE. 

By C. B. SIMPSON. 
(Author's Abstracf.} 

The forms used were the larvae of Carpocapsa pomonella, 
Clisiocampa americana, and Pieris rapce. The alimentary 
canal is divided both anatomically and embryologically into three 
regions : the fore-intestine, the mid-intestine, and the hind-intes 
tine. The embryology and general anatomy of these different 
parts were given, illustrated by sketches. 

The fore-intestine extends from the mouth to the mid-intestine, 
and is composed of the following parts: the mouth cavity, the 
pharynx, oesophagus, and the oasophageal valve. 

Descriptions of these different parts were presented and special 
attention was given to the embryology and structure of the ceso- 
phageal valve which was illustrated by sections. The walls of 
the fore-intestine consist of an external layer of circular muscles, 
an internal longitudinal layer, a basement membrane, and a layer 
of epithelial cells, forming a syncitium, the inner portion of which 
was strongly chitinized, thus forming a chitinous intima. 

The mid-intestine is about half of the length of the canal in full 
grown larvae and is the true absorbing organ. The histological 
elements are : an external layer of longitudinal muscles ; an inter 
nal circular layer, a basement membrane, a single layer of epithe 
lial cells, and the peritropic membrane. The cells of the epithe 
lial layer are of two kinds, the ordinary epithelial cells and the 
mucous cells. The structure of these cells was given and sections 
shown. The peritropic membrane, that membrane immediately 
enclosing the food, is believed by the author to be the coagulated 
secretion of the mucous cells. 

. The hind-intestine has essentially the same structure as the fore- 
intestine, except that the muscular and chitinous layers are much 
stronger, especially the circular. The accessory organs present 
are the Malpighian tubules and the rectal glands. 

The functions of these parts were given with special attention 
to digestion.

Discussion was participated in and questions asked by Messrs. 
Benton and Gill. 



FEBRUARY 13, 1902. 

The 1 66th regular meeting of the Entomological Society of 
Washington was held at the residence of Mr. J. Kotinsky, 521 
Fourth street, N.W., the society being there entertained by the 
bachelor members. President Dyar occupied the chair, and 
Messrs. Quaintance, Caudell, Morris, Heidemann, Ashmead, 
Cook, Vaughan, Howard, Hunter, Simpson, Gill, Stiles, Barber, 
Currie, Kotinsky, and Patten were also present. 

Under the head of Short Notes and Exhibition of Specimens, Mr. 
Heidemann showed specimens of the ten species of the Fulgorid 
genus Scolops contained in his collection. In a paper by Prof. 
Uhler, published by the Maryland Academy of Sciences, nine 
species were recognized. Three more species, however, have 
recently been described by Mr. E. D. Ball, raising the total 
number of described North American Scolops to twelve. 

Mr. Ashmead stated that he had recently received from Dr. 
P. Magretti specimens of the genus Paracyphonyx. This genus, 
erected by Dr. Magretti, was subsequently suppressed by Kohl 
and made a synonym of Pompilus, Fabricius. An examination 
of the specimens sent, however, has convinced Mr. Ashmead 
that the genus is good and distinct, though closely related to 
Pompilus. 

Prof. Cook exhibited some interesting Myriapoda from Cali 
fornia, contained in a collection sent him by Mr. Carl F. Baker. 
One of these represents a new species of Striaria and is the 
second Californian species of this genus known. Another, a 
specimen belonging to the superfamily Chordeumoidea, is sug 
gestive of the Sumatran Heterochordeuma of Pocock. 

Mr. Caudell exhibited drawings, based upon specimens 
recently received from California, of the male and female of 
Timema californica Scudder. This insect has been classified 
with the subfamily Anisomorphinae in the Phasmidas. It is, 
however, the only known member of the Orthoptera having 
three distinct joints to the tarsi. All ten abdominal segments are 
distinct, instead of only nine, and the legs are attached ventrally 



74 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

instead of laterally. Mr. Caudell considered it very closely 
related to the Forficulidae, the males having forcipated and 
toothed anal appendages and there being other points possessed 
in common with the earwigs. It looks very much like a wing 
less Embiid (Embia iihrichi wSaussure) from Trinidad.* The 
systematic position of this insect was further discussed by Messrs. 
Cook, Howard, and Hunter. 

Dr. Stiles, referring to a disease which has of late proven 
so fatal to horses in the Philippine Islands, said that it is known 
as Surra and is closely allied to the tsetse-fly disease of South 
Africa ; it seems to be spread by flies of the genus '/ abauus' 
The disease originated in India where Tabanus tropicus was the 
supposed transmitter. Unlike the malarial parasite, which goes 
through a double life-cycle, a sexual in the mosquito and a non- 
sexual in man, Trypanosoma, the parasite of Surra, has only a 
non-sexual generation so far as is known. This being the case, 
the disease may probably be carried by any biting or piercing 
insect. 

Dr. Howard said, in discussing Dr. Stiles' note, that the con 
ditions governing the spread of this disease pointed as well to 
some biting Muscid allied to the tsetse-fly as to one of the 
Tabanids, since both are dependent for successful breeding on 
moisture conditions. The biting Muscids breed most success 
fully in moist manure and the Tabanids in damp soil muck, 
while the Surra is well known to be most prevalent in damp 
localities and during damp seasons. He agreed with Dr. Stiles 
that the disease is probably carried by either of these types of 
biting flies. 

Mr. Morris read extracts from a letter from Mr. Pollard, 
written from Baracoa, Cuba, where the latter, in company with 
Dr. Edward Palmer and Mr. William Palmer, was making a 
collection of plants and zoological specimens. 

The first paper was by Mr. Caudell and was entitled : 

SOME INSECTS FROM THESUMMIT OF PIKE'S PEAK, FOUND 

ON SNOW. 

By A. N. CAUDELL. 

No tourist visiting the Rocky Mountain region for the first time 
thinks of leaving without ascending Pike's Peak, that most acces 
sible of the high mountains. During our season's collecting in

OF WASHINGTON. 75 

Colorado last year, Dr. Dyar and I followed the general custom 
and made the ascent. We arrived at the summit of the peak 
about 4 P. M., and took a walk to see what we could find in the 
way of insects. A sharp wind was blowing and it was so cold 
that we feared but little would be found. The summit is one 
great mass of irregularly shaped blocks. of granite No vegetation 
was seen except a little grass and a few small, brightly colored 
flowers, which had found root in a level spot some way down the 
side of the mountain. Here we found a number of small beetles, 
Phyllotreta pus ilia Horn, and we thought this was to constitute 
the whole of our catch. But fortunately such was not to be the 
case, for a couple of small snow fields yielded results appreciated 
only after our return to Washington, when, upon getting their 
identification completed, I find there are no less than 78 different 
species. Though we collected many more species lower down 
the mountain, and ones of more value, it is only these specimens 
found on snow that I wish to discuss. 

There were two of the snow fields, one very small, hardly more 
than a couple of rods across, and one larger one, something over 
an acre in area. They lay a hundred yards or so below the Sum 
mit House on the south side of the mountain, and were crusted 
over sufficiently to bear up the weight of a man. The insects 
were found scattered over the surface and their bodies were par 
tially sunken into the snow. In nearly all cases they were either 
dead or so benumbed with cold as to be almost motionless. But 
one exception occurred, that of the little Chrysomelid beetles men 
tioned above, which were found in great numbers clustered about 
the bodies of larger insects. They were perfectly active, a num 
ber taking flight when disturbed. 

With few exceptions all the insects are inhabitants of the boreal 
region of the foot hills and not true alpine forms. They were 
doubtless carried to this high altitude by ascending currents of air 
and, once up, the foolish, inexperienced creatures were attracted 
to the smooth, glistening snow fields, there to perish. 

Not more than half an hour was consumed in gathering the 
specimens, and at the time I estimated the number of species rep 
resented to be not more than twenty. Had I known there were 
nearly four times that number I would have made further efforts 
at collecting and additional species would probably have resulted. 

For the identifications I am indebted to Mr. Coquillett in the 
Diptera, and Mr. Ashmead in the Hymenoptera, except the For- 
micidae which were determined by Mr. Pergande. Mr. Schwarz 
named the Coleoptera and Mr. Herbert Barber furnished me with 
their distribution. Mr. Banks named the single species of Neurop- 
tera, and the Orthoptera I identified myself. The lists of Lepi- 
doptera and Hymenoptera, containing original matter, are 
signed by their respective authors.

LEPIDOPTERA. 
By HARRISON G. DYAR. 

Ctnucha venosa Walker. 

One example. The species flies in Mexico, Texas and Col

It is not uncommon, yet was not taken by us on this trip, except 
this example on the snow. 
Gnophala latipennis Boisduval. 

One example. The species was flying at the Half-Way House 
and had been abundant there a week previously. It was seen 
also in several of the canyons. 
Carneades perexcellens Grote. 

One example in poor condition, rendering the identification 
uncertain. The moth is a common Noctuid of the foot-hills. 
Clisiocampa fragilis Stretch . 

Fifty examples. The species was occuring in countless num 
bers above the Half- Way House, where acres of aspen trees had 
been defoliated by the larvse. The moths were flying in swarms 
all day about the leafless trees, which were loaded with their 
cocoons like fruit. 



78 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

Cacoecia semiferana Walker. 

Three specimens. These were the true semiferana, the oak- 
feeding species, doubtless from the oaks in the canyons near Man- 
itou. The box-elder species, which has been confused with 
this, has the same markings, but is much paler, often nearly 
uniformly creamy white with marks obsolete. It may be called 
C. negundana. There are likewise two forms under the name 
C. argyrospila Walk. The bright reddish or ochraceous one 
may be called C. vividana. I will refer to these more fully in 
treating of the larvae collected in Colorado. 

There also occurred three specimens of a Pyralid, all in such 
poor condition as to preclude the possibility of even a generic 
determination. 

The species normally living above timber line and which were 
flying in fair numbers at the time, such as Colias meadii, 
Argynnis helena, Chionobas scmidea, two species of Anarta 
and several Tortricids and Tineids, were not taken on the snow.

The Coleoptera come next to the Hemiptera in point of num 
bers, there being twenty species.

Six adults and one larva. This is a true Alpine species. It is 
found in Labrador and has been taken in Colorado, on Mt. Lin

above timber in the mountains of New Hampshire (6000 feet). 
M. spretus is the species that has been reported as common in high 
altitudes in Colorado, and has been taken by Prof. Scudder on 
Pike's Peak. But I saw no specimens of this species anywhere 
in Colorado, and Prof. Gillette, the Entomologist of the Colorado 
Experiment Station, says that it has not been taken in the State 
for over seventeen years. Mr. W. D. Hunter tells me, however, 
that he took a few specimens in 1897 at Julesburg.

HEMIPTERA. 
By O. HEIDEMANN. 

In this small but interesting collection are represented five

Lygaeidae, eight species ; one species of Capsidae and one of Aradi-

Podisus cynicus Say. 

Twelve adults and one larva ; males and females. Six of these 
specimens evidently belong to another species, probably P. bracte- 
atus Fitch. This species is considered by some American authors 
as synonymous with P. cynicus Say. But the writer has lately 
had occasion to examine Fitch's type specimen, a female (U. S. 
Nat. Mus.), and to compare the same with specimens of P. cyn 
icus, and there seems to him no doubt that P. bracteatus 
will have to stand as a separate species. The female genitalia are 
decidedly distinct in these two forms ; there are also differences 
in the shape of the body, which in P. bracteatus is comparatively 
broader and shorter. However, more material from other local 
ities will have to be examined, and especially the male charac 
ters, before a definite conclusion can be reached.

NOTE3 ON THE LIFE HISTORY OF THE CODLING MOTH. 
By C. B, SIMPSON. 

(Author's Abstract.) 

In the Pacific Northwest there has been much diversity of opinion 
in regard to the number of the broods of Carpocapsa pomonella 
Linn. During the past few years three broods was the commonly 
accepted number. In attempting to solve this question of the 
number of broods, Mr. Simpson found great difficulty in de 
termining the limits of a brood on account of the great over 
lapping. Upon examining records of larvae killed under bands, 
it was noted that at certain times there was a greater number 
of larvae under bands than at other times. Numerous circu 
lar letters were sent to the Idaho fruit-growers in 1901, asking 
them to keep band records. These records were tabulated and 
curves drawn on cross-section paper. Mr. Simpson exhibited a 
number of these curves. It was noted that on all curves there 
were two distinct maximums of larvae going under bands. From 
these facts he concludes that there are only two full broods in 
Southern Idaho. A possibility of a third brood was mentioned. 
Observations in orchards were deceiving. Prof. Gillette had con 
cluded that there were only two broods in Colorado. In Idaho 
the Codling moth was but little injurious in the transition life zone. 

Mr. Simpson exhibited many photographs taken by himself of 
the insect in its different stages, its work upon fruit, methods of 
control, and Idaho orchards. 



In discussion, Dr. Howard said that he had heard Prof. Gil 
lette's paper on this pest read before the meeting of the Associa 
tion of Economic Entomologists at Denver last summer. Prof. 
Gillette then made the sweeping assertion that two broods was 
the rule for this insect over the whole United States. His con 
clusions, however, were drawn almost entirely from observing

the life history in breeding cages. Dr. Howard thought that Mr. 
Simpson's method of observation and record was most surely cal 
culated to furnish the data for correct conclusions.

THE EARWIG'S FORCEPS AND THE PHYLOGENY OF 
INSECTS. 

By O. F. COOK. 

The earwigs are a group of tropical insects with very few rep 
resentatives in temperate regions. But in spite of their retiring 
habits they have received a considerable amount of popular atten 
tion, because of the fear inspired by the rather formidable pair of 
forceps carried at the end of the body. Entomologists know, 
however, that the creatures are quite harmless, and that their 
forceps are not only free from any poison glands, but are not suf 
ficiently strong to make a wound or puncture. In fact, no ade 
quate explanation of the function of the forceps seems to exist, as 
evidenced by the following summary of the scientific knowledge 
of the subject by Dr. Sharp, the eminent entomologist of the 
British Museum. 

" The pair of forceps with which the body is armed at its ex 
tremity forms another character almost peculiar to the earwigs, 
but which exists in the genus Japyx of the Thysanura. These 
forceps vary much in the different genera of the family ; they 
sometimes attain a large size and assume very extraordinary and 
distorted shapes. They are occasionally used by the insects as a 
means of completing the process of packing up the wings, but 
in many species it is not probable that they can be used for this 
purpose, because their great size and peculiarly distorted forms 
render them unsuitable for assisting in a delicate process of 
arrangement ; they are, too, always present in the wingless forms 
of the family. Their importance to the creature is at present quite 
obscure ; we can only compare them with the horns of lam- 
ellicorn Coleoptera, which have hitherto proved inexplicable, as 
far as utility is concerned. No doubt the calipers of the earwigs 
give them an imposing appearance, and it may be of some little 
advantage on this account ; they are not known to be used as 
offensive instruments for fighting, but they are occasionally 
brought into play for purposes of defence, the creatures using them 
for the infliction of nips, which, however, are by no means of a 
formidable character."* 

For at least one member of this group this deficiency of knowl 
edge can be supplied by the fact that an earwig supposed to be

OF WASHINGTON. 85 

Labia minor Scudder, common in the vicinity of Washington, 
uses its forceps to spread its wings, and is apparently unable to 
resort to flight without the assistance of its caudal armature. 

It is well known to entomologists that the hind wings of the 
earwig differ from those of all other insects, except those of the 
Staphylinid beetles, in being folded transversely to fit under the 
short anterior wings, which serve merely as protective covers. 
The method of folding is, however, entirely different in the two 
groups, and the suggestion of the above quotation that the ear- 
wiguses the forceps to fold the wings seem to be quite erroneous. 
It was probably borrowed by analogy from the beetles, where 
the flexible abdomen is used, as it were, to tuck the wings under 
their covers. The wings of the Staphylinidas are still expanded 
when the insect alights, and are sometimes allowed to remain so 
when neglected through fright or annoyance. 

With the earwig, on the contrary, the closing of the wings is 
instantaneous and apparently quite automatic ; when the insect 
alights its wings are completely folded, and it runs away without 
the necessity of any of the preliminary contortions of the Staphy- 
linidae. Moreover, unlike the beetle, the earwig does not open 
its wings readily or when running. The operation is obviously 
a special effort which requires it to stand still and exert its undi 
vided attention for a very appreciable interval. The wing covers 
and wings are soon raised from the body, but the wings do not 
unfold until, by repeated quick upward movements of the re 
curved abdomen and forceps they are, as it were, combed out and 
spread for flight. Occasionally an earwig seems to lose the power 
of keeping the wings open, and repeatedly falls down after short 
flights of an inch or two, though apparently making efforts at 
longer journeys. Instead of direct flights, they often rise and con 
tinue to gyrate in a spiral about two inches in diameter. 

It is, of course, possible that this observation would not apply 
to all the winged earwigs, and, to judge from the past, much time 
will be needed for its verification in the different families and 
genera of the group. That the present use of the forceps remained 
so long unnoticed is probably to be explained by the fact that the 
earwigs, like the termites, are nocturnal or twilight insects, and 
when disturbed in the daytime never attempt to use their wings, 
but run for shelter and concealment in the dark. The insects 
which were seen to fly had been attracted to a light in the even 
ing, and there also flight seem-ed to be undertaken only when the 
creatures felt themselves at leisure. When annoyed or frightened 
they attempted only to run away the faster. Several genera of 
earwigs, including Apachya, collected under similar circum 
stances in Liberia, were also seen to alight with their wings 
already folded, and to bend their abdomens while resuming flight, 
though the nature and object of the movements were not then ap-

predated or noted in detail. The complexity of the wingfold is 
such, however, that the need of an accessory organ like the for 
ceps appears by no means improbable, and in the absence of any 
other suggestion of general pertinence, it seems not unwarranted 
to proceed on the assumption that the primary use of the forceps 
of the earwig is the unfolding of the wings. 

It is, of course, to be expected that such organs as the forceps 
would be utilized in other ways, though the failure of entomolo 
gists to discover such secondary functions may be taken as an 
indication that no very extensive adaptation has taken place. 
The most that can be said at present is that both in the earwig 
and in Japyx the long, slender hairs with which the forceps are 
sparingly clothed are an indication that the tactile sensibility resid 
ing in the stylets of many insects is at least partially retained.. In 
some genera the forceps have become enlarged and thickened to 
an extent strongly suggestive of a defensive use, and it is of further 
interest to note that such forms are often wingless, and that the 
broadening and thickening of the abdomen tends to diminish the 
flexibility which is retained by the more slender form and laxer 
skeletal structure of the winged genera. The unusually broad 
abdomen of the winged African genus Apachya is an exception 
to this rule, but here flexibility is provided for by the extreme 
thinness of this part of the body, whils the forceps are so peculiar 
as to suggest the existence of some unique adaptation. There 
also exist winged species with robust bodies and strong forceps, 
but, like many beetles, these may make no use of their wings. 
Indeed, it is easy to understand the evident tendency toward the 
abandonment of so specialized and difficult, and at the same time 
so relatively unnecessary an activity as flying seems to be among 
the earwigs. With the earwigs, as with the termites, the wings 
probably serve the single important purpose of cross-fertilization, 
interbreeding, or panmixia, which conduces at once to organic 
vigor and to evolutionary progress. But owing to their more 
active habits and their freedom from social organization and caste 
specialization, the power of flight is of much less vital importance 
to the earwigs than to the termites, and although the latter use 
their wings for but a single flight all sexual individuals are winged, 
while many genera of earwigs long since abandoned flight alto 
gether. 

The existence of so many wingless earwigs is not, however, an 
argument against the use of the forceps with the wings, nor against 
the adequacy of such an explanation of the evolutionary origin 
and universal presence of the forceps in this group of insects. 
Such an objection could be maintained only on the theory that 
the ancestral earwig was wingless, and that wings have been in 
dependently developed by different genera of earwigs, a position 
which nobody is likely to maintain. It is appreciated, however, 



OF WASHINGTON. 87 

that the failure of any of the wingless earwigs to lose the forceps 
is not in accord with commonly accepted evolutionary theories. 
Instead of dropping the forceps with the wings, the caudal ap 
pendages have, in some cases, apparently increased in size, and 
have certainly continued to differentiate in form, attaining, for 
example, a marked asymmetry in the wingless genus Anisolabis, 
a condition which could not possibly have a functional signifi 
cance in connection with the wings, and in all probability has 
none in any other relation. The continued presence of the for 
ceps in the wingless earwigs is, moreover, paralleled as an evolu 
tionary phenomenon by the equally useless multiplicity of form 
which appears in the forceps of the winged genera. The func 
tion here ascribed to the organs in question renders it highly im 
probable that there is the slightest use in the differences of form, 
size, and armature of the forceps, and the great variability of 
these characters also forbids the supposition that any definitely 
specialized uses remain unknown. Both sexes of Labia minor 
use their forceps in the same manner, though the form of the ap 
paratus is very different, and it is nearly twice as long in the male 
as in the female. This is probably one of the endlessly numerous 
secondary sexual differences having no direct use, but perhaps 
serving an important purpose in contributing to the diversity 
which many organisms maintain inside specific lines. The gen 
eral maintenance of a direct proportion between the length of 
the abdomen and the length of the forceps* supports the view 
that natural selection has tended merely to keep the forceps long 
enough to reach back to the wings. 

The field of biology abounds, however, in similar phenomena 
which appear to be anomalous and mysterious when viewed from 
exclusively selectional or static theories of evolution, but which it 
seems preferable to interpret as examples of a general law of bio 
logical change for its own sake, as it were, and independent of 
natural selection.! 

As accessories of the organs of flight the forceps are, of course, 
to be looked upon as an adaptation, but from what? Presumably 
from the jointed stylets to be found in so many groups, but more 
particularly from such as those of the peculiar insect described 
by Westwood, under the name Dyscritina^ but subsequently re 
ported to be the larva of an earwig. Dyscritina, which the 
writer has observed and collected in Liberia, may be said to com-

bine the habits of the earwigs with those of the true Thysanura. 
It lives among vegetable debris in very moist places, is extremely 
quick and agile in its movements, is very soft and delicate in tex 
ture, and is provided witli a pair of long, many-jointed stylets 
instead of the forceps of the adult earwig. Curiously enough, 
these are exactly the differences which obtain between Japyx, the 
only other insect with forceps like the earwig, and the smaller 
and more thysanuroid analogue of Campodea also found in Liberia 
and described before this Society in 1899, un der the name Pro 
japyx * Recently Projapyx has been found to be not uncommon 
in Porto Rico, and seems always to occur in the same localities 
as the Porto Rican species of Japyx, that is, in all sorts of situa 
tions from moist valleys to the tops of dry limestone hills. 

But if Projapyx is really the larva of Japyx, students of the 
temperate species have failed of their full duty, or else we have 
found repeated in this orderf the strange conditions of the ear 
wigs where some species have a larval stage and a metamorphosis 
which have been suppressed in the others. 

It is realized that this reasoning reverses, for the present case, 
at least, the opinion held by Lubbock and others that the larval 
stages of insects are derivative and adaptative, not ancestral 
and primitive. No reason is, however, apparent why one of 
these opinions should exclude the other, and in the present in 
stance it seems obvious that from the standpoint of hexapod 
structure Dyscritina is much less specialized than the adult earwig, 
or than the larva of the Hymenoptera or Lepidoptera. 

If, instead of holding that the Dyscritina stage of the earwig 
is an adaptation, we interpret it as a more primitive condition, 
it will be necessary to apply the same reasoning to the orthop- 
terous groups to which the earwigs have been thought to be 
closely allied. Most of the cockroaches, like most of the earwigs, 
have no pronounced metamorphosis, but in several genera there 
is a transformation in both sexes, while in others only the males 
reach the winged condition. Metamorphosis is more accentuated 
among the cockroaches than among the remaining orders of 
Orthoptera, so that the current opinion that these insects are 
primitive because they have no metamorphoses is self-contra 
dictory. 

Having thus emancipated ourselves from the notion that the 
cockroaches represent the primitive insect type, it will be easier 
to appreciate at its proper value the long-obvious probability

t A separate order Dicellura was established for Japyx in 1896, for the 
reason that it seemed more remote from the true Thysanura than the 
latter are from the Orthoptera. See Brandtia, p. 49. July 30, 1896; also

that the ancestral distinction belongs to the so-called neuropterous 
orders with aquatic larva? and complete metamorphoses. Dys- 
critina as the larva of an earwig, and Projapyx as the larva of 
Japyx, bring the orthopterous series closer to the aquatic larvae 
of the Neuroptera, with their many-jointed stvlets, and thus per 
mit us to think of the archetypal insect as a creature with meta 
morphosis and with wings instead of beginning with a thysanuran 
ancestor and being compelled to imagine the wings as appearing 
kt independently at several points" as maintained bv Professor 
Smith.* 

For the correctness of this view, that the neuropterous orders 
with aquatic larvae are the more primitive,! a large amount of 
evidence might be brought together, but perhaps the most con 
spicuous advantage of this standpoint lies in the fact that it per 
mits the suggestion of an origin and method of development for 
the insect wing, which can scarcely be accounted for by any 
rational evolutionary theory beginning with the assumption that 
the first insects were land animals. 

The wings of the birds, pterodactyls, bats, fishes, and other 
flying animals, are known to be modifications of organs used for 
locomotion in water or on land, but we have been contented to 
assume that the wings of insects were made, so to speak, from 
whole cloth, and have failed to associate them as the homological 
equivalents and derivatives of older structures used for purposes 
other than flight. 

Kinetic evolution views as normal the progressive change of 
any particular part, but would not prearrange and carry forward 
the complex and delicate adjustments of structure and function 
necessary to the perfection of such organs as wings, since, except 
for flying, wings are about as useless structures for terrestrial in 
sects as could well be imagined, and some representatives of 
nearly all the orders have abandoned them. 

But if the discussion be transferred to the water, we have, so 
to speak, much clearer sailing. Fins too small for flying are still 
very useful to fish, and a gradual and natural increase of size of 
swimming organs to the point where they can be used for flight 
is illustrated by the analogy of the flying fishes.J

The lack of means of aerial existence and of locomotion on land 
has kept the fish from terrestrial conquests, but aquatic insects 
are not thus restricted, and thousands of species, including mem 
bers of many different orders, are still able to make the ancestral 
substitution of a terrestrial for an aquatic habitat. Many also 
remain in the water as adults, and use their wings for swimming. 
Some of the May-flies descend into the water to lay their eggs, 
and in the genus Pteronarcys the adult winged insect has external 
gills. The most conspicuous suggestion for the formation of 
wings from gills is, perhaps, to be found in the larvae of the May 
flies, where the gills have become subdorsal and the tracheae 
which, in other groups, hang in brush-like clusters, are spread 
out instead as veins of delicate, leaf-like membranes, and even ar 
ranged in a manner strongly suggestive of the patterns of the wings 
of some adult insects of other groups. The utilization of the 
anterior pairs of such lamillar gills as swimming organs, and their 
subsequent further specialization as wings, is thus a supposition 
requiring no abrupt or improbable change of structure or function, 
and affords a rational explanation of organs otherwise as mysteri 
ous morphologically as the wings of angels. 

So much for the argument afforded by the winged and wingless 
earwigs, and the similarity of the jointed stylets of the earwig 
larvas to those of Projapyx and Campodea. Shortly after writing 
this sketch of phylogenetic possibilities, I received from Dr. 
Filippo Silvestri,* of Bevagna, Italy, a paper in which my 
meagre account of the anatomy of the African Projapyx is greatly 
extended by observations on a South American species. Dr. 
Silvestri not only agrees with me that Projapyx is the most prim 
itive of insects, but he holds in addition that it proves the descent 
of the insects from the diplopods, because he finds that the jointed 
stylets are spinning organs homologous with those of Scolopen- 
drclla and with those of the diplopod orders Crelochetat and 
Monocheta. But if Projapyx is the larva of Japyx instead of a 
mature insect, Dr. Silvestri's reasoning must be reversed, and 
we should prepare ourselves to believe that the Symphyla, Dip- 
lopoda and Pauropoda do not represent the ancestors of the hex- 

tion through a small arc, like the insects. The distances traversed are 
too great, and the rate of speed too slow and too uniform to be explained 
by the momentum with which the fish leaves the water. This conclusion 
is the result of many excellent opportunities of observation within the last 
ten years, principally in the Cape Verde region of the Atlantic. The ob 
jection of some ichthyologists that the flying fish is not so constructed as 
to be able to vibrate its fins in the air would also render these organs use 
less in the water.

apods, but are, as it were, larviform off-shoots from the insect 
phylum. In other words, we may compare the diplopods with 
caterpillars and other larvae, and may seriously undertake the 
study necessary to determine the reality of what have been sup 
posed to be merely superficial similarities, such as the form of 
the cephalic sclerites, the barbed hairs and the repugnatorial 
pores. Polyxenus looks enough like a caterpillar, and its large 
fossil relative Palceocampa would have been even more strongly 
suggestive of such an affinity.* Moreover, a hexapod origin for 
the Diplopoda would explain the fact that the diplopod larvas are 
hatched with the six anterior legs, the remaining pairs being 
attached to rings intercalated behind the genital segment. The 
anamorphous Chilopoda are hatched with seven pairs of legs, but 
the others are added by intercalation in front of the genital seg 
ment, which thus appears near the posterior end of the body in 
the one group and near the anterior in the other. 

In this way it is possible to bridge the chasm which seemed to 
so profoundly separate the Progoneata (Diplopoda, Symphyla, 
and Pauropoda) from the Opisthogoneata (Hexapoda and Chilo- 

* The barbed hairs of the larvaa of the Merocheta, and the bristles of the 
Coelocheta, Monocheta and Colobognatha support the view that the soft- 
bodied, hairy Polyxenus is the most primitive of existing diplopod types. 
It may also be said that the skeletons of the different orders of Diplopoda 
are too diverse to.be rationally explained by descent from a single hard- 
bodied type. In the Merocheta the segmental rings are solid and com 
plete, without even traces of sutures to represent pleural or ventral plates. 
In the Coelocheta, Monocheta, and Colobognatha the ventral plates 
are free ; in the Diplocheta, Zygocheta, and Anocheta they are adnate, but 
are distinct by sutures. The pleurae are free in the Oniscomorpha and 
Limacomorpha and in the Siphonotidoe ; adnate in the Polyzonidse and 
remaining Colobognatha, and in the Monocheta and Anocheta; no traces 
of pleural elements have been reported in the Diplocheta, Zygocheta, 
Coelocheta and Merocheta. Finally, in the order Anocheta, the dorsal 
part of the segmental ring is composed of three transverse bands, a con 
dition perhaps paralleled only in the larvae of the saw-flies. From the 
entomological standpoint these differences would be thought very grave; 
indeed, they maybe said to be altogether too grave for explanation by evo 
lutionary changes in parts already hardened. If, however, we think of them 
as independent acquisitions of firm armor by soft-skinned animals we have 
ample analogies in other groups. This interpretation does not, of course, 
decrease the actual diversity, but it enables us to credit the evidence 
of the otherwise great similarity of structure and function among the 
Diplopoda. It permits Polyxenus to be more closely associated with the 
other Diplopoda, and brings the Diplopoda, as a group, closer to the 
Symphyla and to the Hexapoda.

poda) . That there could be any derivative relationship between 
a group of animals with the reproductive system opening in the 
anterior part of the body (Progoneata) and others with the reverse 
arrangement ^Opisthogoneata) seemed impossible, unless the 
common origin were traced back to worms with unspecialized 
reproductive segments. Should the present suggestion prove to 
have a foundation in fact, we shall have firmer ground for believ 
ing that the insects and the four classes commonly grouped as 
44 Myriapods" do in reality constitute a natural assemblage.* 

Nor do the possibilities of integration end here, since the asso 
ciation of the Progoneata with the insects as derivatives of an 
originally aquatic group reopens the whole question of their affini 
ties with the Crustacea and Arachnida, and may result in the 
rehabilitation of the Arthropoda as a natural phylum or primary 
division of the animal kingdom. 



The paper was discussed briefly by Messrs. Simpson, Gill 
and Stiles. Mr. Simpson said that Prof. Comstock had given 
serious consideration to the theory that the primitive and original 
insects were aquatic and winged, but had finally abandoned it as 
untenable. Ke had noted that the tracheal gills of certain May 
flies are of almost the same pattern as the wing veins. This 
similarity, however, he had found to be accidental. Dr. Gill said 
he thought that there was no ground for believing that insects were 
derived from myriapods. There was a possibility, however, that 
they had sprung from an entomostracan type, though this was 
merely an hypothesis. Insects may have existed in paheozoic times, 
but there was no evidence of it. He maintained that flying-fish 
do not have a true flight, but that their enormously enlarged pec 
toral fins serve merely as parachutes for their sustentation in the 
air until the initial momentum of the fish leaving the water is 
exhausted. 

Prof. Cook, however, maintained that certain of the flying-fish 
really progress through the air by a rapid vibration of the 
wings. He spoke of the resemblance of some geologic Crus 
tacea to the Iarva3 of certain species of cockroaches as of inter 
est and suggestive. 



* For this the name Labrata was proposed in 18^6 (Brandtia, p. 30). 
he Labrata were deemed co-ordinate with tl 
Crustacea) and the Malacopoda (Peripatus).

The 1 67th regular meeting was held at the residence of Dr. L. 
O. Howard, 1336 Thirtieth street, N.W., President Dyar in 
the chair, and Messrs. Kotinsky, Siinpson, Barber, Benton, 
Howard, Ulke, Doolittle, Morris, Currie, Ash mead and Hunter, 
active members, and Mr. H. H. Newcomb, of the Harris Ento 
mological Club of Boston, visitor, also present. 

Mr. W. D. Hunter was elected an active member of the So 
ciety. 

Under the head of Short Notes and Exhibition of Specimens, 
Mr. Newcomb exhibited photographic prints showing the vena 
tion of various insect wings. These prints were made by plac 
ing the wings (those of the Lepidoptera being first bleached) 
upon sensitized paper. He also showed the photograph of an 
hermaphrodite gypsy moth, one side showing male, and the 
other female, characters. The specimen from which this last 
photograph was taken was loaned by Mr. A. H. Kirkland. Mr. 
Simpson described the method, used by Prof. Comstock, of mak 
ing tracing-drawings from enlarged photographs. 

Mr. Kotinsky showed a copy of Newstead's Monograph of 
the British CoccidaB, Volume i,just issued by the Ray Society, 
commenting upon the figures and on certain points in the 
classification as given in that work. He also noted that the 
Dactylopine scale-insect Pergandiella americana Cockerell 
had recently been found infesting the underground portion of the 
stems of Kentucky blue-grass (Poa pratensis) . A very similar 
species, described by Signoret, had been found on grass stems, 
but Cockerell's species had previously been found only upon ash. 

Mr. Simpson exhibited a drawing of the photographic appa 
ratus used by him for getting pictures of the larvae of Hydro- 
psyche in situ in the water, and also showed two prints of the 
photographs obtained. He presented for publication the follow 
ing abstract of his remarks : 

PHOTOGRAPHING NETS OF HYDROPSYCHE. 
By C. B. SIMPSON. 

Many times while observing the nets of this insect in streams, 
the writer wondered if they could be photographed in situ. 
Many attempts were made to do so in Fall Creek, the gorge 



94 



ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 



of which bounds the Cornell University campus. Many failures 
were made, but each failure showed another difficulty to over 
come. The principal 
difficulties were as 
follows : roughness 
of the surface of the 
water, splashing of 
water on the lens, re 
flection from the sky 
and lack of sufficient 
light. The best neg 
atives, from which 
prints are here repro 
duced, were secured 
on a dark day. With 
out doubt much bet 
ter results could have 
been obtained on a 
brighter day. By 
consulting Fig. 3, the 
apparatus used can 
be easily understood. The camera is the usual vertical camera 
with a heavy iron tripod base. Between the upstream legs is 
placed a glass bottomed box which is securely weighted down. 
About a half inch of water was placed in the box. A focussing 
cloth was held over the camera to cut out the reflection of the sky. 
The photographs (Figs. 4 and 5) show fairly well how the nets 
are built at the edge of a little irregularity of the rock surface.

Dr. Dyar presented the following note for publication : 
NOTE ON ARACHNIS DILECTA BOISD. 
By HARIUSON G. DYAR. 

In the Catalogue Lep. Phalaenae Brit. Mus. Hampson describes 
the 9 only of this species. Mr. H. H. Newcomb brought to the 
National Museum for identification a ^ Arachnis, captured in 
Mexico, which is obviously the tf of A. dilecta. It differs from 
the 9 in having the disk of the hind wings white, the crimson 
ground color being confined to the costal and internal margins. 
This sexual difference is exactly as in the allied A. zuni Neum. 
from New Mexico, but in that species the ground color is yellow 
instead of crimson. 



The first paper was by Mr. Ash mead and was entitled 
" Notes on some South American Chalcidoidea." He stated that 
it was now fifteen years since he first undertook to work up t'he

collection of South American Chalcids made by Mr. Herbert H. 
Smith. This collection has recently been purchased by the Car 
negie Museum, and Mr. Ashmead has in preparation a classifica 
tion of Che Superfamily Chalcidoidea in which the new genera 
and species contained in the collection are to be described. He 
commented upon the striking resemblance that exists between 
the Central and South American forms. Dr. Howard's conclu 
sions, published in an article in the Wilder Century Book, that 
there is a definite correlation between the habits and structure of 
Chalcid flies, were supported by Mr. Ashmead's studies. In those 
groups in which the habits are known, it has been found that the 
various species in each tribe have hosts which are also closely 
related to each other. About sixty drawings prepared for Mr. 
Ashmead's paper were exhibited by him and he commented upon 
a number of the many striking and interesting species figured. 
One in particular, a magnificent Chalcid belonging to West- 
wood's genus Pelecinclla, he had named howardi. It is nearly 
an inch in length. This insect belongs to the Cleonymidae, and as 
all members of this family whose habits are known are parasitic 
upon Coleoptera, it seems probable that this species will eventu 
ally prove to have some large South American beetle as its host. 
The paper was discussed by Dr. Howard. He said that, as parts 
of Brazil belong to the same faunal region as portions of Central 
America, he did not think it strange that the Chalcid forms from 
these countries are similar. He thought it doubtful that the 
Eucharidae are parasites of ants. It was possible, he believed, 
that they might prove to be parasites of some of the guest insects 
which occur in ants' nests, and which are often larger than the 
ants themselves. Some of the Eucharids seemed too large to be 
parasites of the ants. 

Mr. Ashmead stated that the group of gall-parasites did not 
confine its attention to the gall makers of any one order of insects 
but infested all kinds of galls. He said that in his forthcoming 
paper he had tabulated about five hundred and seventy genera of 
Chalcid-flies and had succeeded in placing nearly all of the 
described genera. 

The next paper was by Mr. Newcomb, and entitled: "An 
Entomological Trip to Mt. Katahdin, Maine." He gave a very 
interesting and entertaining account of a trip made by him in 



OF WASHINGTON. 97 

June, 1901, in company with three others, to this mountain.* 
He described the country traversed on the way thither, along the 
Penobscot river. Mt. Katahdin is 5,150 feet in altitude and 
seven miles in length. It consists of three peaks, one to the 
north and two in the south. Between the two latter stretches a 
table-land which had hitherto been considered inaccessible. The 
portion of the mountain leading to the table-land is called " the 
Slide." It is i ,000 or i ,200 feet long and very difficult of ascent. 
This table-land, which they succeeded in reaching after an ardu 
ous climb, has a growth of mountain hemlocks and sedge, and is 
strewn with granite boulders. A brownish or blackish-gray moss 
grows abundantly. Here a species of butterfly belonging to the 
genus Chionobas and, at the time, thought to be semidea, but 
afterwards described by Mr. Newcomb as a distinct species, 
katahdin^ was found. The weather was very foggy and cloudy 
most of the time, so they did not remain long upon the table-land, 
but Mr. Newcomb and another entomological member of the 
party returned to it again on the following day. Forty-nine 
specimens of the Chionobas were then secured. When resting 
upon the moss-covered ground it was well protected by its color. 
He noticed a curious habit it had of resting with its body and 
wings lying over sidewise. The wind was very strong and the 
butterflies flew close to the ground, usually within two feet of it, 
to avoid being blown down from the table-land. If they were 
blown oft', as sometimes happened, they would strive to get back. 
Mr. Newcomb made the trip again on the third day. On the 
way up, Limenitis arthemis was observed very commonly, but 
scarcely any were seen on the return trip. 

In the discussion of this, Dr. Dyar said he thought it remarka 
ble that a form of Chionobas not semidea should be found on Mt. 
Katahdin, as semidea was the form occurring upon Mt. Wash 
ington. C. katahdin, though hardly a distinct species, seemed 
nevertheless to be a good local form or race. Mr. Morris said 
that botanists have made some very exceptional finds on Mt. 
Katahdin, but that all their trips made thither have been short. 

The last paper read was the following :

THE LOG-CABIN BUILDER. 

(Limnepkilus indivisus Walker.) 

By C. B. SIMPSON. 

During the spring of 1900, while at Ithaca, N. Y., the writer 
incidentally made some observations upon the larvae of this cad 
dis fly. The larvae were found in abundance in a series of still 
ponds near Fall Creek during April and part of May. They 
were found as early as April 9 in 1900 and March 31 in 1901. 
At these times the larvae were from one-fourth to half grown. 
In March, 1901, the winter ice was out, but a thin sheet of ice 
was present. The upper ponds of the series contain water 
throughout the season, while the lower ponds are dry about mid 
summer. 

About April 20 the larvae were nearly all full grown. By plac 
ing the cases containing larvae in a dry box it was found that the 
larvae would leave the cases and thus obviate injury or killing the 
larvae in removing them forcibly. 

When full grown the larvae are about three-fourths of an inch 
in length. The head, prothoracic and mesothoracic shields and 
legs are dark brown or black in color, while the remaining parts 
are clouded white. The legs are well developed and bear well 
developed claws. The first abdominal segment bears one dorsal 
and two lateral tubercles. There are four principal rows of fila 
ments which are nearly white by reason of the trachae and air 
contained in them. On each lateral margin of the abdomen 
there is a row of fine stiff hairs placed closely together. The 
caudal segment of the abdomen bears two prolegs which are 
armed with strong hooks. The use of these structures is evident 
upon examining the habits of the insect. The tubercles and the 
prolegs are used to hold to the inside of the case. The filaments 
are respiratory, and the rows of fine hairs are for inducing cur 
rents of water. 

The cases of the younger larvae consist of small sticks, grass 
stems, leaves and moss arranged in a more or less irregular 
manner. The material of which the cases of the older larvae are 
built depend in a great measure upon the material in hand : 
when an abundance of leaves is present in the bottom of the 
pond these are for the most part used, and, in many, leaves alone 
constitute the case. These bits of leaves are placed one upon 
the other at right angles to the axis of the case, and silk is used 
to fasten them in place. These are placed around the entrance 
to the case in an irregular manner, and are always eaten so as to 
make a smooth interior although the exterior is irregular. When 
larvae are placed in an aquarium they feed from each other's 
cases and break off pieces and incorporate them in their own 



OF WASHINGTON. 9P 

cases, both of which tends to make the exteriors regular. When 
bits of sticks are used they are placed, as with leaves, at right 
angles to the axis of the case. Sticks as large as one-fifth of an 
inch in diameter are often used. The larva* were observed to eat 
out a notch in the inner side of the stick when in place. It is 
quite a task for one to fasten one of these large sticks securely, 
and many times the larvae get into difficulties by adding sticks 
that are so bouyant that they come up to the surface. The insect 
thrusts its body out of the case, jerks and beats the water vio 
lently until a chance foothold is secured, when it crawls to the 
bottom. The larvae immediately begin to build themselves a 
new case when deprived of the old one, and can complete a case 
in one night. Experiments were tried by giving the larvae small 
stones with which to build a case, and in no instance were the 
larvae successful. Snail shells with living snails are sometimes 
used in the cases. A cherry-pit was noted. One larva used two 
wheat kernels which sprouted and caused some inconvenience to 
the occupant. When cases were given naked larvae they imme 
diately crawl into these head first, but in a short time one finds 
them in their normal position. 

The contents of the alimentary canal of several larvae were ex 
amined. In all instances vegetable matter such as leaves and 
wood was found. The alimentary canal is remarkable on ac 
count of the great development of the muscles, particularly the 
circular. 

The first pupation was noted on April 28, and practically all 
had pupated by May :6. Strong silken nets were found at either 
opening of the case ; the cephalic opening being largest. In an 
aquarium a few cases were found attached to the sides of the glass 
jar, while in the pond they could attach themselves to the lower 
side of leaves. Some were found standing on end in the bottom 
of the pond. In all places it was noted that the insect and its 
case were in such a position that no mud could enter the case by 
the circulation. 

The pupae are very delicate, of a white, and later of a pink, 
color. The most interesting structure is the lateral fringe of stiff' 
hairs which was noted in the larvae. In the pupse these hairs 
are larger and are present on the caudal end as well as the lateral 
margin. By placing a case, containing a pupa, in a dish of water 
containing carmine the circulation of water through the case was 
observed. Without doubt this circulation is produced by a gen T 
tie undulatory motion of the abdomen, which action would be 
greatly aided by the fringe of hairs. 

The first adult emerged May 29. The pupa? break the ceph 
alic net and swim to some projecting stick upon which they crawl 
out of the water. The skin splits in the usual way and remains 
fastened upon the stick by the claws for some time. Many adults 



100 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

were observed on the weeds and grasses in and about the ponds. 
The adults are of a straw color and have a green abdomen. The 
adults were kindly determined by Mr. Banks. 

No eggs were obtained in spite of the many efforts. On ac 
count of regular work it was found impossible to further trace 
the life history of the insect. 



Mr. Ashmead asked Mr. Simpson if the larva have an organ 
of attachment, and mentioned a larva of the neuropterous genus 
Raphidia from Oregon, received alive at the National Museum. 
It attached itself very tenaciously to the desk by a suctorial disk 
on the end of the abdomen. He called attention to a figure of a 
Raphidid larva published in the Cambridge Natural History. 
Referring to the trichopterous larva, Mr. Simpson said he had 
never noted such an organ in trichopterous Iarva3. 



APRIL 17, 1902. 

The 1 68th regular meeting was held at the residence of Mr. J. 
D. Patten. The following members were present: Messrs. 
Howard, Stiles, Kotinsky, Busck, Patten, Benton, Simpson, Mar- 
latt and Hunter ; also Messrs. Cattell and von Schrenk, visitors. 
In the absence of the President, the meeting was called to order 
by Mr. Patten. 

Under the heading Short Notes, Dr. Stiles called the attention 
of the Society to a paper in a recent medical publication* in 
which the author described experiments tending strongly toward 
proof of the transmission of dengue or break-bone fever by spe 
cies of the genus Culex. This note was discussed by Dr. How 
ard. 

Dr. Howard mentioned the fact that had recently been 
brought to his attention that the Cuban Anopheles argyritarsis 
Desvoidy breeds at times in water retained in impressions made 
by the feet of cattle. This observation, tnough not unique, is as 
yet unpublished, and has an important bearing upon the possibil 
ity of the destruction of malaria-bearing mosquitoes. 

Dr. Stiles asked the opinion of the Society in the matter of

the proposed investigation of the relative feasibility of the vari 
ous canal routes in Central America as far as mosquitoes and 
the diseases transmitted by them were concerned. After some 
discussion the following resolution was proposed by Mr. Benton 
and unanimously passed : 

Resolved, That it be the sense of the Entomological Society 
of Washington that a commission of scientific men, at least one 
of whom should be an entomologist, should be appointed to visit 
Central America to investigate the feasibility of the different 
proposed interoceanic canal routes as regards the prevalence of 
diseases transmitted by mosquitoes, the possibility of controll 
ing the breeding places of such mosquitoes, and the consequent 
restriction to shipping interests by quarantine regulations that 
might be necessary in the different localities. 

Mr. Benton called attention to some recent observations he 
had made to the effect that the Cyprian race of bees preserves its 
drones much longer than any other race. 

Upon motion of Dr. Howard, the reading of the papers on 
the regular program was postponed in order that Mr. Marlatt 
might give the Society an account of his recent travels. Mr. 
Marlatt then proceeded, with the aid of maps, pictures and spec 
imens, to narrate the results of his trip around the world, paying 
especial attention to the observations made in Japan that led him 
to the conclusion that that country is not the original home of 
Aspidiotus perniciosus. Extended observations in China, how 
ever, demonstrated, in his opinion, that the insect is there strictly 
indigenous. 

MAY 8, 1902. 

The 1 69th regular meeting was held at the residence of Mr. 
E. A. Schwarz, 230 New Jersey avenue N.W. President Dyar 
occupied the chair, and Messrs. Schwarz, Howard, Ulke, Busck, 
Barber, Kotinsky, Gill, Ashmead, Marlatt, Patten, Heidemann, 
and Currie were also present. 

Upon motion by Dr. Howard, the Society moved to suspend 
the rules, and unanimously elected Mr. Ulke an honorary mem 
ber. 

Under the heading Short Notes and Exhibition of Specimens, 



102 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

Mr. Ashmead mentioned that bees of the genus Andrena were said 
by Mr. Sherman to be injurious to grass. Discussed by Messrs. 
Howard and Schwarz. The latter remarked that similar injury 
done by the burrowing of a Nomia (TV. nevadica ?') was noticed 
by himself, in iSSo, near Selma, Ala. A piece of pasture land 
overgrown with Lespedeza showed bare spots, or dying plants, 
where the burrows of the bee abounded. A Rhipiphorid beetle 
(Myodites semiflavus) and several Mutillas were bred from the 
cells of the bee. 

Mr. Heidemann exhibited specimens of Diaditus pictipes 
Champion received from the town Hidalgo, on the Rio Grande 
river, in southern Texas. This is one of the smaller Reduviids, 
evidently belonging to the subfamily Stenopodinas. The genus 
Diaditus was founded by Stal upon a specimen from Monte 
video, Uruguay, which he named semicolon. Another species, 
Diaditus annulipes, was described by Berg from Buenos Aires, 
Argentina. Two more species, D. hirticornis and I), pictipes, 
were described by Champion from Panama and Mexico, in the 
Biologia Centrali- Americana, and to this last-mentioned species 
Mr. Heidemann's specimens from Texas belong. The genus 
Diaditus has not previously been recorded as occurring north of 
the Mexican boundary. 

Mr. Schwarz exhibited a specimen of a Lucanid beetle ( Dorcus 
parallelus Say) which was completely covered with mites, its size 
being thereby several times increased. The identification of the 
specimen in this condition was attended with considerable diffi 
culty. Beetles and other insects were often more or less infested 
with mites, but it was very rarely that a specimen was found 
completely covered by them as in this instance. Such a speci 
men was figured, the species infested being Carabus auratus^ in 
the Berliner Entomologische Zeitschrift, Volume XVII, PL I, 
Fig. 2, 1873, by Dr. G. Kraatz. The mite, in the case of the Lu 
canid, is an immature form of a Gamasid and not determinable. 

Mr. Busck spoke of the peculiar cocoon of a Tineid moth 
(Marmara salictclla Clemens) which is covered with masses of 
small round white bubbles like shot. It was a matter of conjec 
ture what these were and how they came there until Mr. Busck, 
in studying the habits of the living larva, watched it while en 
gaged in spinning its cocoon. A framework of silk was first 



OF WASHINGTON. 1.03 

spun, and then the larva blew out the bubbles from the anal end 
of its alimentary canal and thrust them through the framework so 
as to make a covering for the outside of the cocoon. The bub 
bles were examined with a microscope, but no trace of silk could 
be found in them. Mr. Busck stated that, in the stage before the 
last, the larva is flat and footless ; in the last stage it has feet and 
is round and slender. The note was discussed by Messrs. How 
ard, Gill, and Ashmead. Dr. Howard called attention to a note 
by Paul de PeyerimhofF in the Annals of the Entomological So 
ciety of France, Vol. LXX, 1901, pp. 150-152, on the mechanism 
of the hatching with the Psocidas. He w r anted to especially point 
out that the author, in describing the peculiar habit of the issuing 
embryo of swallowing mouthful after mouthful of air in order to 
swell its body and assist in bursting the enveloping membrane, 
was anticipated by H. G. Hubbard. Peyerimhoflf had been un 
able to find any former record of this peculiar habit with the 
Psocidae, but the speaker pointed out that Hubbard, in 1885, in 
his masterly volume on the insects affecting the orange, on page 
195, described this process exactly with Psocus citricola Ash- 
mead. 

Mr. Kotinsky reported to the Society some observations he 
had made upon the larvae of Chilocorus similis, recently brought 
from China by Mr. Marlatt, which, he thought, might raise a 
question as to the distinctness of this species from C. bivulnerus. 
The larvae of similis, when in the jar in which they were reared 
in the Department, were light colored, distinctly lighter than are 
larvae of bivulnerus ; afterwards, when they had been exposed to 
the light for some time in a breeding cage, they became darker, 
so that they looked very much like bivulnerus larvae. 

Mr. Marlatt said he thought Mr. Kotinsky had stated the matter 
rather too strongly. He thought that the change of color was 
not clue to change in the color of the larval integument, but rather 
to a difference in the proximity of the spines, brought about by 
a larval moult. He believed that similis larvae differed from 
those of bivulnerus and could be distinguished.

NOTE ON A CALIFORNIAN FRUIT WORM. 
By HARRISON G. DYAR. 

Dried fruit, infested with " worms," which proved to be lepi- 
dopterous larvae, were received at the Department of Agriculture 
from Santa Clara County, California. The resulting moths were 
Vitula serraiilineella Ragonot. Their larvae show some pecu 
liar points of structure. 

Egg. Elliptical, flattened above and below, symmetrical, 
rounded ; soft-skinned, coarsely granularly shagreened ; some 
what translucent, pale yellowish or wood color. Size about 
.6 x .4 x .3 mm. 

Larva. Head rounded bilobed, the vertex retracted in joint 2, 
somewhat flattened before and erect ; clypeus not reaching the 
membranous vertical triangle ; red-brown, sutures of clypeus and 
mouth darker, ocelli black. Body cylindrical, tapering slightly 
toward the ends, segments dorsally 2-annulate ; feet normal, 
small, pale, the abdominal ones with crochets in an ellipse. 
Cervical shield distinct, large, transverse, luteous translucent, 
brown at the marginal tubercles. Anal plate darker luteous. 
Body whitish, rather opaque, a red dorsal shade at maturity. 
Tubercles small, dark brown ; iib of joint 3 and iii of 12 and all 
those of joint 13 enlarged. On joint 13 dorsally there is a single 
medio-dorsal shield carrying the tubercles ii of each side ; a lat 
eral shield bears i and iii, which are closely approximated ; on 
joint 12, tubercle ii is a little dorsad to i; on the central seg 
ments i and ii are in line, iv -f v ; on the thorax ia -f ib, iia -[- iib, 
iv -f- v. The enlarged tubercles iib of 3 and iii of 12 have the 
hair in a large, clear space around which the tubercle shield 
forms a ring; these hairs must be specially movable. Seta? 
rather long, brown. Spiracles brown, those of joint 12 larger 
than the others. Anal feet with a brown leg shield.

SECONDARY SEXUAL CHARACTERS IN SPIDERS. 
By NATHAN BANKS. 

That differences in size exist between. the sexes of spiders has 
long been known, and often commented upon. Yet it does not 
apply to all spiders ; with the Theraphosidae, Pholcidas, Dysder- 
idae, Drassidae, Clubionidae, Agalenidae and Dictynidae there is 
little difference in size between the sexes. Usually the abdomen 
of the male is more slender than that of the female, but the 
cephalothorax is about as large. In the Agalenidae the male is 
frequently larger and stouter than the female. In many Theri- 



OF WASHINGTON. 105 

diidae (micro-theridiidae) there is little difference in size between 
the sexes. In the Epeiridaeand Theridinse the male is commonly 
smaller, often very much smaller ; in the Oxyopidae and Lycos- 
idas there is not much difference in size, and with the Attidae the 
males are never much smaller than the females. In the male sex 
of Thomisidae, Epeiridae, some Theridiidae, and a few Clubionidae 
the legs are proportionally or actually longer than in the female. 
The difference in coloration between the sexes of many Attidae 
has been dwelt upon by Prof. Peckham. It is far more promi 
nent in this family than elsewhere in spiders. The Thomisidae 
often show slight differences, and they are, in a few cases, I think, 
due to sexual selection. In at least one species {Xysticus tri- 
guttatus} there are two forms of the male, one colored as the 
female, the other, and much more common form, marked in a 
different manner. In the Oxyopidae, Oxyopes salticus shows a 
very marked difference in the color of the sexes. In the Lycos- 
idae there are few cases, none very prominent. The male of 
Lycosa ocreata has the tibia I clothed with long, black, erect 
hair, which might well be considered as an ornament. In sev 
eral species of Pardosa the male is very much darker than the 
female. In some Theri diidae certain parts are more brightly 
colored in the male sex. In Latrodcctes\he male is much marked, 
and resembles the young of both sexes. In a few species of 
Dictyna the male is of a different color from the female. 

The secondary structural characters in spiders are perhaps 
more interesting and less understood. I know of no case in 
either the Thomisidse or the Lycosidag. In the Attidae we quite 
frequently notice that the mandibles of the male are much longer 
and larger than in the female, as Zygoballus, Philceus, Epiblc- 
mum scenicum, and Icius mi trains. In the males of some 
species of Habrocestum there are small projections on the tips of 
the patellae and tibiae of the third pair of legs. These projections 
are sometimes prominently colored, and are probably for orna 
ment. In the Tetragnathidae the mandibles of the male are 
usually larger and furnished with more teeth than in the female. 
Yet in the female they are much elongated. It is probable that 
this character is partly due to the general lengthening of all parts 
of the body, and later was especially modified in the male. But 
not all long and slender spiders have elongate mandibles ; as in 
Hyctia and Tibellus they are of usual size. 

In the Epeiridae we notice that in the males of some species 
the tibiae of the second pair of legs are thickened, and thickly 
clothed with stout spines, while the metatarsi are curved ; for 
example in E. trivittata, E.foliata, etc. Sometimes the tibia 
bears a curved projection as in Maliadeva. These characters 
may be of so Tie use in holding the female and preventing her 
from turning and biting the male. In the males of a few species 



106 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

there are spines on the anterior coxae, as in E. solitaria, E. 
angulata, and E. silvatica. These species also have the tibia 
and metatarus of leg II modified as above. Similar projections 
on the coxae will be noticed in some Clubionidae. In those 
Epeirids that have humps or spines on the abdomen the male sex 
is almost destitute of such characters. The head of male Epeirids 
is nearly always narrower than that of the female. 

In the Theridiidae there are a large number of differences in 
the sexes. In Microdipoena there is a curved, spine-like pro 
jection at the tips of the anterior tibiae and metatarsi. A similar 
structure is found in some tarantulas. The head of the male of 
this genus is much higher than in the female ; this is a very com 
mon difference in the family. In Theridium frondeum and one 
or two allied species there is a small hump at the base of the 
mandibles in the male. The mandibles are elongate and toothed 
in the male of Theridium sexpunctatum\ and in certain species 
of Linyphia and Erigone. In the males of some species of 
Tmeticus and Microneta there is a spine on the front of each 
mandible. In T. tridcntata there is a row of teeth on the sides 
of the mandibles, and in the female these are present in a rudi 
mentary condition. In some species of Erigone the sides of the 
thorax in the male are spiny. In a number of micro-therididac 
{^Lophocarenum , some Ceratinella, etc.) the head of the male is 
curiously modified ; elevated into humps of various shapes, and 
in the former genus with a little hole on each side. In the male 
of Tmeticus unicornis there is a prominent projection on the 
clypeus ; a similar one exists in the male of Histiagonia rostrata. 
In the latter and in the allied Ancylorrhanis hirsuta there is a 
corneus shield on the abdomen of the male. In Ceratinella the 
males possess a similar shield above and sometimes also below ; 
in some species it may be present in the female. In Cornicularia 
there is a horn between the eyes of the male. In Erigonoplus 
the male has the metatarsus of the front legs greatly swollen ; 
this genus has the head lobed as in Lophocarenum. In the male 
of Maso the head is much broader than in the female. 

The importance of the sexual peculiarities of the micro- 
therididae is not understood. Though they are not ornamental 
in our eyes, they serve to give a distinctness to the male which 
may be of service in enabling the female to recognize her proper 
male ; for except in these secondary sexual characters and in the 
genitalia (accessory) the species are much alike. In Asagena 
the cephalothorax is rougher in the male than in the female, and 
it is said that these spiders make a noise by rubbing the base of 
the abdomen over the cephalothorax, but it has not been observed 
in the American species. In this genus the second pair of legs 
is very spiny in the male. 

In the Agalenidae two species of Hahnia have the hairs on the 



OF WASHINGTON. 107 

anterior legs of the male elevated on little projections. In the 
Dictynidce the males of Dictyna have the mandibles longer than 
the female, and bowed. In the Clubionidas a few species of 
Clubiona have ridges on the edge of the mandibles of the male. 
In three species of Gayenna (G. calcarata,fraterna. and pec- 
torosd} there are spines on the posterior coxae ; these are possibly 
of use in holding the female. In Thargalia several species have 
horny shields at the base of the abdomen in the male. In the 
Drassidae several species also have a horny shield at the base of 
abdomen of the male. 

In the Dysderidas the anterior metatarsi of the male Ariadne 
bicolor are curved and have a spine on each side. In Plectrurys 
may be noticed a hook-like process on the anterior tibia of the 
male, and the males of Eurypelma (Theraphosidas) also have a 
curved hook at the same place. These projections are probably 
of use in holding the female. The mandibles of the male of 
Psilochoi -us pulhilus (Pholcidae) have each a spine on the front; 
the same are found in Pholcophora americana; in the latter 
species there is also a hump on each anterior corner of the sternum. 
In Physocyhis gibbosus it is the female that is modified, the 
hinder part of the cephalothorax is elevated behind into a spine. 
The cephalothorax of the male is flat as usual in the genus. 
These various projections on the mandibles of the Pholcidas are 
probably of no use in righting, and probably not ornamental. 

When one considers that each of these species has several allied 
species that exhibit no sexual structural peculiarities, it is difficult 
to explain the cause of these structures. Many cannot be used 
in fighting. Some Attidas, as Zygoballus, are known to fight ; 
but there are other Attidas that also fight, and show no sexual 
structural differences. A few of them may be ornamental. 

However, one must draw largely upon his imagination to find 
any use for some of these structures. 

I would rather suppose that it is a part of the male inheritance 
to be endowed with an intense nervous restlessness that some 
times finds an expression in extreme developments of color or 
structure. Sometimes these may be seized upon and maintained 
by sexual selection. And. again, although they are not useful, 
they may be maintained as outlets for the excessive vigor of the 
male. 

This, I think, would be more plausible than that they are the 
results of accidental variation -maintained by sexual selection. 



The next paper, " Notes on the Habits of two Cicindelidae 
from Texas," by Mr. J. D. Mitchell, of Victoria, Texas, was 
presented by Mr. Schwarz, who made some introductory remarks 



108 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

upon the personality of Mr. Mitchell, and the keenness and relia 
bility of his observations. Mr. Mitchell, he said, was an ardent 
naturalist, and had accumulated a large amount of valuable infor 
mation from his studies of nature. None of these observations, 
however, had been written out, and Mr. Schwarz, when in Texas 
last winter, persuaded him to put some of his notes in the form 
of a paper. Mr. Mitchell complied with his request, and this 
paper was accordingly presented to the Society with Mr. 
Schwarz's recommendation that it be published. 

OBSERVATIONS ON THE HABITS OF TWO CICINDELIDiE. 

By J. D. MITCHELL. 

i. Tetracha Carolina. 

In the daytime the males hide under logs, trash piles, dead 
leaves or bunches of grass ; the females dig for themselves a den 
just large enough to turn around in, in some well-drained place, 
always using a weed leaf or grass blade to hide the opening. 
When they come out in the evening, they hurry to the water's 
edge, and thrusting their mandibles deep into the moisture, take 
a long drink. Then they begin their search for food ; they run 
fast, but erratic in course ; they are very shy. I have never been 
able to make one eat in captivity. I have observed them capture 
insects many times, but could not identify the insects captured. 

The sexual season is continuous from June to frost. The 
female avoids the male, running, dodging and hiding when pur 
sued by a male. She seldom accepts sexual service without a 
struggle. The male seizes the female with his powerful pincers, 
at the junction of the thorax and abdomen, and forces matters 
with her. The act consists of one insertion of the penis, lasting 
about two minutes sometimes the male holds on for a second 
insertion, but that is the exception. The female deposits her eggs 
always near fresh water, one in a place, a quarter or half inch 
below the surface of the ground and always in some well drained 
spot. The young larva digs a hole an inch and a half or two 
inches deep, and open at the top, bringing the earth in small 
pellets to the surface in its strong pincers and depositing them as 
far from the opening as it can without leaving its hole. As the 
larva grows it digs its hole, larger and deeper, reaching a depth 
at maturity of twelve to eighteeen inches, according to soil. If 
an ant, sow-bug or like insect is dropped into their den, it is 
seized and eaten. I have never seen a larva leave its hole, but I 
have seen them reach half their length all around the opening. 
I have dug out full grown larva? on the 2Oth day of January, 



OF WASHINGTON. 109 

1902. By March their holes are open in every direction in large, 
numbers. 

The mature beetle is very shy and runs fast and hides effec 
tively. They have good wings, but I could never induce one to 
fly in daytime. At night they will fly, but always crawl up on a 
stick or something to start from. If captured and placed in a 
bottle, a pair will copulate, so strong is this instinct. They are 
sometimes called by the natives the u white-eyed bug." 

The above observations were made near Alligator Head, Cal- 
houn County, Texas, in the years 1901 and 1902. 

2. Cicindela rectilatera. 

The beetles have but two objects in life eating and propaga 
tion. They are omnivorous ; they will eat algag and the fine 
green moss that grows on moist ground around springs, pulling 
it loose and shaking it free of sand before chewing it up. They 
will also eat any small insect that they can capture such as small 
ants, very young fiddler crabs, marine fleas, etc. They will also 
eat any dead flesh that is fresh such as fish, rabbits, etc. I once 
skinned a large moccasin for them and in less than half a day I 
had a beautifully-cleaned skeleton ; they will not eat carrion. 

In midsummer they seek shade in the heat of the day ; all the 
balance of the time, day and night, they spend moving about. 
They prefer the margins of the bays, rivers, lakes, and ponds, 
but I have seen them, apparently content, many miles from 
water. They run by spurts and fly promptly when danger 
threatens. 

In the breeding season, which is from June to frost, the sexual 
desire seems to be entirely on the side of the male, and it is sel 
dom that the female submits to the act without a struggle to pre 
vent it. The male seizes her with his strong pincers between 
the thorax and the abdomen, and, will she, nil she, forces the 
matter. The act consists of from three to five insertions of the 
penis, according to the vigor of the male, each insertion lasting 
about one minute with a rest spell of about three minutes be 
tween insertions. So strong is this instinct in the male that he 
will perform it in a bottle held in the hands, and I have several 
times had them to die in the cyanide bottle without losing hold 
of the female. After the female has surrendered to the male, she 
goes about seeking food, carrying the male on her back. When 
the male releases the female, he makes a good run, for she turns 
on him and tries to bite him. 

When ready to deposit her eggs, the female flies some distance 
from her haunts. I have found colonies of larvae three and four 
hundred yards from where the nearest adults lived. She lays 
one egg in a place, but places them from one to six inches apart. 
As soon as the young larva hatches, it opens a hole to the sur- 



110 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

face and digs downward, increasing its den in size and depth as 
it grows, until it reaches eight or ten inches deep. If a green 
grass stem is dropped into their hole they will seize it, when a 
quick jerk will place the larva above ground. 

The above observations are from a lifetime of observation in 
Southern Texas. 



Mr. Schwarz stated that Mr. Mitchell had presented a full- 
grown larva of Tetracha Carolina to the National Museum 
which hitherto possessed only the larvae of T. virginica and 
T. euphratica. 

Mr. Currie reported that over thirty specimens of Tetracha 
virginicu had been taken from the toilet room in the Smith 
sonian building last summer. They had no doubt been attracted 
thither by the light at night and had been unable to get out. He 
thought they must breed somewhere in the vicinity. Mr. Schwarz 
thought that they could hardly breed nearer than the Pptomac 
river or the carp ponds of the Fish Commission, as they required 
damp places for this purpose. Mr. Marlatt said he had collected 
large numbers of Tetracha Carolina in the daytime in Kansas 
under clods of earth on plowed ground. The only water near 
was a small pond. 

Mr. Schwarz then remarked upon the occurence of Cicin- 
dela striga in Florida. The first specimens were found by Hub- 
bard and Schwarz, attracted by the light of the camp fires at 
Lake Harney and Enterprise. In 1894 a third locality was dis 
covered in the vicinity of Punta Gorda. Here C. striga and C. 
severa were seen on July i4th flying ahout during the noon hours 
on a meadow-like opening in the pine woods close to the shore 
of the bay. At the suggestion of Mr. Hubbard the place was 
visited during a severe rain storm, when the meadow was under 
water, excepting a few small hillocks. It was then found that 
the Cicindelas had taken refuge under fallen leaves beneath the 
small bushes growing on the hillocks. With a little strategy 
specimens were then easily secured. 

Mr. Schwarz said there was a commonly-prevailing belief, 
discredited by naturalists, that centipedes would leave a streak 
in their path wherever they crawled over a person's body ; in 
other words, that the claws of their feet would cause a poison- 



OF WASHINGTON. Ill 

ous inflammation wherever they touched the flesh. Mr. Mitchell, 
of Victoria, Tex., told him of a case which came under his ob 
servation. A man discovered a centipede crawling over his back 
beneath his shirt. He endeavored to capture and remove it but 
had some trouble in doing so. When the man's back was ex 
amined a streak, which afterwards turned blue, was found where 
the creature had crawled. The man was sick for some time but 
finally recovered. Mr. Schwarz said that if this had been 
reported to him by anyone not a reliable observer he would not 
have believed it. He thought that the injury was inflicted after 
the centipede had been irritated by the man's effort to capture it. 
Dr. Howard said that the only poison glands known in the cen 
tipede were situated at the base of the maxillipeds. 
Mr. Marlatt then read the following paper : 

COLLECTING NOTES ON MOSQUITOES IN ORIENTAL 
COUNTRIES. 

By C. L. MARLATT. 

In the progress of a trip made by the writer from San Fran 
cisco to Honolulu, Japan, China, Java. Ceylon, Egypt, and 
home again via France, special effort was made to collect the 
mosquitoes which were in evidence in hotels and inns stopped at 
The trip covered over a year (i9Oi-'o2), six months of which 
were spent in Japan, and shorter times in the other places enu 
merated. The main object of the trip being the collection and 
study of insects of other kinds, no special effort was made to col 
lect mosquitoes in the open nor otherwise than as stated. The 
notes, therefore, are practically an account of the different kinds 
of mosquitoes which were found in the cities and towns visited, 
and notably those liable to attack travelers and guests at the dif 
ferent hotels and inns. An examination of the records indicates 
that the house mosquito in greatest abundance and most wide 
spread is the Culex pipiens Linne. This mosquito occurred 
practically everywhere, and was the species which was most in 
evidence in point of numbers. It certainly deserves the title of 
being the world mosquito as an indoor pest. Species of Ano 
pheles were not very often met with, and, on the other hand, 
were several times found in places where they would not have 
been expected, or, in other words, where malaria is practically 
unknown. The writer was bitten frequently by all the species 
of mosquitoes collected, and many of those collected were taken 
in the morning charged with blood. No results of any very seri 
ous consequences followed any of the bites of mosquitoes, Ano- 



112 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

pheles included. In certain very malarious districts this doubt 
less is to be ascribed more to good fortune than anything else. 
All of the material was examined and determined by Mr. Coquil- 
lett who furnished notes also on distribution. 

Leaving San Francisco in winter, it was a rather odd exper 
ience to have the mosquito problem thrust forcibly on one's atten 
tion in the Hawaiian Islands in early March. On the hotel 
verandas and in the hotel dining-rooms and bedrooms in Hono 
lulu at this season of the year (March i4th to 2ist) mosquitoes 
were very abundant and very pestiferous, it being almost impos 
sible to avoid being bitten many times during the evening and 
night. The most abundant species collected here was Culex 
pipiens. About the city of Honolulu the Chinese and Japanese 
farmers are actively engaged in the growth of rice after the sys 
tem followed in their respective countries, and the flooded rice 
fields and irrigating ditches furnished ample means for the breed 
ing in abundance of the mosquitoes, which characterized the 
place and season. 

THE MOSQUITOES OF JAPAN. 

Japan was reached the first of April, and explorations through 
out the islands, from the north island (Hokaido), in the latitude 
of Maine and Nova Scotia, to the lower end of the southern large 
island of Kyushu, the latitude of St. Augustine, was prosecuted 
from the date of landing until the date of departure, September 

22d. 

Japan is an ideal country for mosquitoes. The great staple 
crop and the main food of the Japanese is rice, and rice fields 
cover every inch of the country which can be reduced to a level 
and brought under water. For several months in the year, there 
fore, much of Japan is a shallow water pool, and the country is 
filled with the irrigating ditches and canals which supply water 
to the rice fields. The very slight use of beasts of burden, also, 
has led to the cutting up of the larger cities and towns with canals, 
by means of which the products of the country are brought to 
every section of the city. These canals forming a network through 
the cities are choice breeding places for mosquitoes, and the re 
sult is that when the mosquito season comes around the mosquito 
nuisance is perhaps greater in Japan than any other country in 
the world ; at least the writer has never seen mosquitoes so abun 
dant as in some of the Japanese inns. Furthermore, every 
Japanese establishment of any pretensions has its little garden 
with everything in miniature, and including among the rest two 
or three little lakes fed by streams of running water, very greatly 
adding to the picturesqueness of the surroundings, but affording 
at the same time exceptional breeding places for different mosqui-

toes. Another feature in the economy of the Japanese house is 
the numerous washbowls, crockery or stone, set up by the side 
of the houses so that the guest can step out on the little porches 
and wash his hands and face in the open. These stone or crock 
ery washbowls are of considerable size, holding several gallons 
of water, and are kept replenished all the time, and mosquitoes 
breed in them in considerable numbers. 

The common mosquito of Japan is Czdex pipiens, and this 
species was really the only one that occurred in any special 
numbers and everywhere. Anopheles was found only once in 
Japan, and then a species (A. sin'ensis Wied.) previously known 
only from China. Japan is notably free from malaria in spite of 
the fact that the Japanese live half their time in water in the rice 
fields and the abominable condition of the city canals and water 
ways. This fact is very good confirmatory evidence of the neces 
sity of the Anopheles as a means of conveying this disease. 

The mosquito season begins in Southern Japan early in May. 
In April no mosquitoes were noticed. The worst period for 
mosquitoes seems to be June, in my own experience, but the 
mosquito pest continues, with very little decrease, throughout 
the summer. The rainy season, with its daily rains and exces 
sive heat and humidity, may have the effect of somewhat restrict 
ing the multiplication of the mosquitoes, causing a slight abate 
ment of the nuisance in the latter part of June and July. 

The mosquito pest in Japan would be unendurable were it not 
for the very effective mosquito net which is put up in the little 
Japanese bed room at night. This net (" kaya," from Ka, 
mosquito) consists of a great square tent of strong green netting, 
the color being very restful to the eyes. When one is ready to 
retire for the night, the mattress bed having already been made 
up on the floor, the mosquito tent is produced and dropped as a 
big bundle on the middle of the floor. Strong cords run from 
each of the four corners of the tent and connect with hooks in 
the corners of the room. One corner after another is pulled out 
and hooked up high on the walls, so that when all the corners 
are adjusted the tent is raised from the floor, except a lapping of 
three or four feet of cloth, and you have a tented room within 
the room proper nearly as large as the room itself. By this 
method of lifting the kaya from the floor every mosquito is ex 
cluded, and throughout the six months' experience in Japan 
wherever the kaya was used not a mosquito bite was inflicted 
during the night. The kaya has the advantage also of being very 
large and roomy, and does not give the shut-in sensation which 
one gets from little mosquito nets, fitting closely, as they com 
monly do^ to the bed. One can have a table and write or study 
within these nets, and be perfectly safe from the myriad of mos 
quitoes which are swarming outside. IT* getting within the 



114 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

kaya one goes on all fours, and the little Japanese maid stands 
close by with a fan which she waves vigorously while the hasty 
scramble is made under the edge of the net. 

The Japanese house is a mere framework of heavy timbers. 
The outer wooden walls (amados) are removable in sections, 
and within these are the paper walls (shoji) which may also be 
removed, or slide together, leaving the rooms absolutely open to 
the air and light. The result is that mosquitoes have free 
access to Japanese houses nntil the retiring hour, when 
the shoji are slid back, and the amados are replaced, closing the 
house up very tightly unless vigorous protest is made in the 
interests of air and to prevent partial asphyxiation. Very for 
tunately while the rooms are lighted the mosquito is not often 
troublesome in Japan (and I refer now more particularly to 
Culex pipiens}. This, however, is by no means an absolute condi 
tion, and one will be bitten often enough even if 99 per cent, of 
the mosquitoes are inactive in the presence of light. This is in 
marked contrast to the behavior of the mosquitoes of Singapore 
and Java, which bite quite as readily at night in partially lighted 
rooms as in the dark. 

The general notes which follow are arranged by localities. 

Okayama, Japan, May 4^/2. The inn at this place where 
two nights were spent faced a swamp in which grew the sedge 
or reed, used as a covering for Japanese house mats. The hotel 
was infested with a very large mosquito, evidently an Anophe 
les, with distinctly spotted wings, and so vicious was this insect 
that it was impossible to avoid being bitten many times during 
our late dinner and before refuge was taken beneath the u kaya." 
It was also exceptionally active, and the greatest difficulty was 
experienced in capturing a few specimens. This mosquito, deter 
mined by Mr. Coquillett as Anopheles sinensis Wied., was the 
only Anopheles found in Japan. It was originally described 
from China, and has not heretofore been reported outside of that 
country and is new to the National collection. Culex pipiens 
also occurred here in moderate numbers. 

Takamatsu, Japan, June 3. At no place in Japan were 
mosquitoes seen in greater numbers than here. They occurred 
simply by myriads, the walls of the rooms being black 
ened by the numbers resting there. They bred in the num 
erous canals intersecting the city. They were the species Culex 
pipiens Linne, and were rather sluggish in light, and collecting 
bottles could be put over them without their making any attempt 
at flight. 

Kotohira, Japan, June 4. In this small interior town but 
few mosquitoes were found, apparently of the same species that 
occurred at Takamatsu. These two localities are both on the 
island of Shikoku, an island out of the line of ordinary travel. 



OF WASHINGTON. 115 

Gifu, Japan. The first stop at Gifu was early in May, and 
mosquitoes had not put in an appearance. On the return to this 
town, June iyth to 2Oth, the mosquitoes were present in enor 
mous numbers, the common species evidently being the Culex 
pipiens, although the specimens collected, which were a good 
many, were lost in the mails. In Japanese rooms there are 
numerous little closets with, sliding doors in which the bedding 
and other paraphernalia are kept out of sight, and on opening 
these little cupboards one would find them in the daytime simply 
crowded with mosquitoes, and in all the smaller closets and dark 
rooms the mosquitoes collected in enormous numbers. In the 
daytime these mosquitoes were not at all in evidence, except 
when disturbed in their retreats, and mosquito attacks in the day 
time were practically unknown. 

Nagoya, Japan. Nagoya, one of the largest cities of Japan, 
is on low ground and much cut up by canals, and mosquitoes 
were in evidence in astonishing swarms. The inn at which we 
put up was a semi-European one, and- the beds had the small 
European mosquito nets, the lower edges of which were care 
fully tucked under the mattress. In my own case, however, the 
sealing was not perfect, and some thirty mosquitoes filled up 
with my blood at regular intervals during the night. These I 
collected in the morning, and were all identified by Mr. Coquil- 
lett as Culex pipiens. They presented, however, in the effect of 
their bites, a marked contrast to all the experiences with this 
species before. The bite of this mosquito never produces any 
bisect on me, and the point of puncture is not noticeable after the 
littlosquito flies away ; but in the case of the bites at Nagoya their 
m O'unctures made a bright red point which remained in evidence 
infor several weeks, turning ultimately -brown. The feature of 
fr special interest at this place occurred early in the night when the 
writer was in a very sound sleep from the fatigue of a very long 
and hard day's work. In the course of the night my elbow was 
pushed against the mosquito net, and some time after I was 
awakened by a burning pain in that quarter of my anatomy. 
When I became fully awake I realized the cause of the trouble, 
and crouched more narrowly in th6 center of my meagre bed. 
An angry roar of mosquitoes massed at the particular spot where 
my elbow had been indicated an enormous swarm concentrated 
there, and did not abate for about an hour. In the morning there 
was a spot on my elbow the size of a silver dollar, bright red 
and filled with hundreds of punctures. Evidently as many as 
could do so had been biting at once, and numerous relays had had 
their turn. The spot changed from red to brown, and remained 
in evidence about three weeks. All of the specimens collected 
at this place proved to be Culex pipiens. 

Yamada, Japan, June 22d to 24^. The mosquito of this 



116 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

district was also Culex pipiens. It occurred in very much less 
numbers than at Nagoya, but abundant enough to be a distinct 
nuisance. Its bite here had even a more inflammatory effect than 
at Nagoya, producing very large red blotches, which persisted 
for days. At Nagoya the bite produced merely a small red spot 
or point. With the exception of these two localities no inflam 
matory effect from the puncture of this mosquito was especially 
noted. 

Yokohama and Tokio, Japan, June 26th to July i^th. Mos 
quitoes in this region, the low country surrounding the bay of 
Owari, were not very abundant ; in other words, while they oc 
curred scatteringly in the rooms every night, they did not appear 
in the great swarms which had been seen farther south. The 
only species secured was the Culex pipiens, which in Yokohama 
was comparatively rare, but rather more abundant in Tokio, 
doubtless on account of the greater numbers of canals in the latter 
place. 

Sapporo, Japan, August \%th to 22d. This was the most 
northern point reached in the Japanese Empire, having the lati 
tude of Nova Scotia. The mosquitoes collected were Culex 
pipiens, and a species of Culex undetermined They were fairly 
abundant. The same species occurred at Aomori, and at all the 
other stops made in North Japan. 

Sendai, Japan, August 2^th and 29^/2. This town is half 
way between Tokio and Aomori. Culex pipiens was the com 
mon and abundant species. Another species of Culex ( Culex 
concolor Desv.) also occurred here, but more rarely. 

The elevated mountain regions of Central Japan in the nei^j 
borhood of Nikko in which the latter part of July and the first 
August were spent were not characterized by mosquitoes ; at lea\ 
no mosquitoes were noted in the various inns stopped at. This 
elevated mountain region is very moist, rains occurring daily, and 
the streams characterized naturally by very rapid currents. It 
should be further noted that in the southern island of Kiushu, 
which was explored during the month of May, no special nui 
sance of mosquitoes was experienced and no collections were 
made. The district in which the mosquitoes were most abundant 
in Japan was the southern coast of the main island in the Ise 
province, and on the island of Shikoku lying immediately to the 
south of the main island. They were much in evidence but less 
abundant along the eastern coast of the main island of Japan 
northward to and including the island of Hokkaido. 

THE MOSQUITOES OF CHINA. 

In the experience of the writer China cannot be called very 
much of a mosquito-ridden country. This experience can hardly 
be charged altogether to the season of the year of the visit, which 



OF WASHINGTON. 117 



covered the time between September 26th and November 
or. in other words, the early fall, which is usually a very prolific 
mosquito period. Furthermore, malaria is much more feared in 
China than in Japan, which would indicate a greater prevalence 
of the species of the genus Anopheles. The exploration of China 
extended from the region north of Pekin southward to Hong 
Kong. At no place visited were mosquitoes at all abundant, and 
only a few individuals were'captured. The conditions in China 
are very similar to those in Japan, namely, a great deal of the 
country from the center southward is devoted to the culture of 
rice, and there are always more or less of canals leading through 
and around the cities. The cities proper, however, are not 
broken up by canals as completely as they are in Japan. The 
highways of China are canal,s instead of roads, and the products 
of the country are taken along these canals in the peculiar Chinese 
junks or scows, and travel in the interior is necessarily, for the 
most part, in boats on these canals. In that way the writer made 
a trip into the region west of Shanghai in a house-boat, going 
through many miles of these country canals, and part of the way 
through the grand canal which connects Pekin in the far north with 
the ocean at the southern part of Hang-chow. The conditions, 
therefore, were favorable enough for an abundance of mosquitoes, 
and their absence was rather remarkable, under the circumstan 
ces. The mosquitoes collected in and about Shanghai in Central 
China and at Tientsin, and Pekin in north China, were Culex 
pipiens Linne. On the house-boat trip into the interior west of 
Shanghai where one was living all the time on the water of the 
little canals, for the most part with ' scarcely any current, the 
mosquitoes were only noticeably bad at one place, namely, Hain- 
ing, and we were much bitten during the nights spent there. In 
fact, no mosquitoes were observed elsewhere on this trip. The 
house-boat was open, and most of the mosquitoes at Haining es 
caped at daylight, and only a few were captured. These repre 
sented two species, Anopheles sinensis vanus Walker, a species 
originally described from Celebes and reported by Theobald from 
the Malay Peninsula and India, and represented further in the 
National collection by specimens from the Philippines. This 
Anopheles is the one that was the greatest pest at this point. 
The other species was Mr. Coquillett's Culex subalbatus, which 
was originally described from Japan, and has not hitherto been 
reported outside of that country. 

A stop of several days was made at Singapore, British Straits 
Settlements, Malay Peninsula, and we were very much annoyed 
all the time, day and night, by the persistent attacks of mosqui 
toes. The most troublesome of the mosquitoes was the very 
prettily marked little Stegomyia (Stegomyia fasciata Fab.j, 
originally described from the West Indies, but occurring over 



118 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

the warmer parts of the world, and now notorious as the agent 
for conveying the yellow fever parasite. This little black mos 
quito is active in the daytime, making its attack and escape very 
quickly ; in fact, it was some time before a specimen could be 
detected in the act, the least movement causing the insect to dart 
away. It manifested a very notable tendency to fly up under the 
edge of the trousers, biting through the stockings, or on the 
wrists under the sleeves, and very rarely alighted on the bare 
hands or face. A sudden and intense itching was the first indica 
tion of the presence of the pest, and this itching continued, caus 
ing great annoyance, for about two hours, and then slowly dis 
appeared. This little species resembles very much an Anopheles, 
having spotted wings and resting in the same oblique position on 
walls. It was the great mosquito pest of this region, and was 
found later in considerable numbers in Java and in Ceylon. A 
greater variety of mosquitoes were found at Singapore than at 
any point previously visited, as indicated by the accompanying 
list: 

Anopheles rossii Giles. 

Culex pipicns Linne. 

Culex vishnui Theobald. 

Stegomyia fasciata Fabr. 

Stegomyia scutcllaris Walker. 

Of the second species of Stegomyia (S. scutellaris), but one 
specimen was secured. This species was originally described 
from the Aru Island, and Theobald reports it as occurring from 
Japan to the Fiji Islands, and westward to Mauritius. 

THE MOSQUITOES OF JAVA. 

The mosquito problem in Java is a rather serious one. The 
island is devoted, like Japan, to the culture of rice ; and, further 
more, there is a great deal of low, swampy country near the 
coast where malaria has always been a grievous scourge, so 
much so that it has been necessary to establish large convalescent 
stations in the mountains to which the soldiers are regularly 
transferred after a period of service in the low country. Through 
the chance meeting in Japan, with some longtime Dutch residents 
of Java, some idea of the conditions in this island was obtained, 
and letters of introduction were secured to the army medical 
service, which, in the last few years, has been very much inter 
ested in the mosquito problem in its relation to malaria. Doc 
tor Koch, of Berlin, spent some time on the island, about 
two years before my visit, studying and collecting mosquitoes, 
and had aroused very wide interest in the subject. Shortly after 
my arrival at Batavia, I called with the American Consul, Mr. 
Rairden, on the chief medical officer of the army, Doctor Fruitog, 



OF WASHINGTON. 119 

who introduced me to his assistants charged with the laboratory 
experiments on mosquitoes. The work being done is of a very 
thorough and practical sort, mainly directed, so far, to the study 
and identification of mosquitoes of Java, and getting information 
on their breeding habits and distribution. I was informed that 
a species of the genus Anopheles occurred pretty generally 
throughout the island, and my subsequent experience confirmed 
this statement. 

Some three localities in Java are especially noted as being 
very much subject to malaria. These are the lower city of 
Batavia, and especially the landing-wharf, Priok ; Tjilatjap, a 
low, marshy coast region on the south side of the island, which 
has the worst record of all for malaria, and an interior district, 
Ambabuwa, situated somewhat inland from Samareng. Else 
where in Java the Anopheles does not seem to be especially 
associated with malaria. The Anopheles of Java is A. rossi'i, 
and was collected by me in nearly all of the main points at which 
any stop was made. Curiously enough, this species was found 
both at Soekaboemi and at Sindanglaja, the two mountain resorts 
with convalescent stations where soldiers and the Dutch residents 
suffering from malaria are sent to recover. In both of these 
regions, therefore, malarial patients must often be bitten by mos 
quitoes and by this Anopheles, and yet new cases of malaria are 
practically unknown in these places! I was assured of this state 
of affairs, which is somewhat astonishing, by Doctor Fruitog and 
some of the other surgeons in the army service, whom I have to 
thank for courtesies in giving information and for the collection 
of some specimens from Batavia and Priok. 

At Batavia malaria is more or less common, and the Anopheles 
also, although the mosquitoes most in evidence there were 
pipiens and other species of Culex. At Buitenzorg and Garoet 
the Anopheles occurred in considerable abundance. Both places 
have a fairly high elevation, and malaria is very little feared, the 
only cases appearing being those introduced from other districts. 
All the places stopped at in the interior of Java were fairly ele 
vated ones, with the exception of Batavia and Maos, which latter 
is on the edge of the notorious Tjilatjap district. At Maos a 
great many mosquitoes were collected, but some of the lots were 
lost, and the only ones shown in the list determined by Mr. Co- 
quillett are Culex pipiens, Culex lishnui, and Culex tenax 
Theobald, the latter being the abundant species. My own recol 
lection is very distinct of two species of Anopheles, one of which 
was a very minute species, the smallest I have ever seen, and of 
a light ash-gray color. I regret the loss of these specimens. 
The list of mosquitoes collected in Java follows. Weltevreden, 
it may be said in explanation, is the upper city of Batavia, and 
considered to be much more free from malaria than the old 
town :

Anopheles rossii Giles. This species was originally described 
from India, and is reported by Theobald from the Malay Penin 
sula. The National Museum collection contains specimens from 
Ceylon and the Philippines. It is the common Anopheles from 
India eastward through the Malay Peninsula and the East Indies. 

Culex pipiens Linne. 

Culex gelidus Theobald, described from the Malay Peninsula. 

Culex concolor Desv. The type locality of this species is un 
known. Theobald reports it from the Malay Peninsula, Burmah, 
China, and India, and the National Museum contains collections 
from Ceylon, and one specimen of it was obtained by the writer 
at Sendai, in North Japan.

pipiens as a house pest, occurring both in the low coast country, 
in the mountains, and on the elevated plain of East Java. It was 
originally described from the Malay Peninsula, and has not 
hitherto been reported elsewhere. 

Culex vishnu i Theobald. This species had been previously 
collected at Singapore, and was taken from three widely sepa

Taken as a whole, the mosquitoes were not a very great nuis 
ance in Java during the time the writer spent there, namely, the 
month of December. The rainy season was just beginning, and 
the conditions were favorable for the mosquitoes, and they were 
everywhere in evidence and annoying, but not occurring in the 
enormous swarms witnessed in Japan, except, perhaps, at Maos. 

THE MOSOJJITOES OF CEYLON. 

En route home a six weeks' stop was made in the island of 
Ceylon. Most of this time was spent in the higher mountain 
regions in the central portion of the island, notably at Kandy and 
Newara Eliya. At Colombo on the coast no mosquitoes were 
collected, and they were not in evidence in the hotel. The 
species collected in Kandy by me were Culex pipiens and prob 
ably the two species of Stegomyia. 6\ scutellaris was certainly 
abundant, and possibly some of the specimens represented 
S 1 . pseudotceniatus Giles. The Stegomyia is the great outdoor 
pest in the mountain country, biting in the daytime and proving 
to be a very great nuisance while collecting in the woods. In 
Newara Eliya occurred the Stegomyia, and also in the hotels 
Culex vagans Wied. and Culex mimeticus Noe. C. vagans 
was originally described from China, and has not hitherto been 
reported from any other region. It was comparatively abundant. 
C. mimeticus was originally described from Italy, and is re 
ported by Theobald from Palestine, India, and the Malay 
Peninsula. But one specimen was taken. 

The mosquitoes of Ceylon have been carefully studied by that 
eminent entomologist, Mr. E. E. Green, who reports the occur 
rence on the island of twenty-one species, including several 
Anopheles. A list of the mosquitoes of Ceylon is appended.

The subject of the mosquitoes of Ceylon in their relation to 
malaria is covered in a publication by Mr. Green, issued by the 
Royal Botanic Gardens, Ceylon, Series i, No. 25, December, 
1901. One item only may be noted from this communication, 
namely, that Mr. Green estimates at least 2^,000 deaths to have 
been due to malaria in the year 1899. From this some idea may 
be formed of the number of cases of malaria, comparatively few 
of the cases resulting fatally. In one instance out of 600 coolies 
employed in railway construction half of them contracted 
malarial fever within a month and were compelled to give up 
work. The Anopheles that seems to be responsible for malaria 
in Ceylon is A. rossii, the species which was the subject of the 
early studies in India leading to the discovery of the true cycle of 
the malarial parasite. 

The mosquitoes collected in Egypt and France in February and 
March on the homeward trip all proved to be Czdex pipiens 
Linne. They were not specially abundant in Luxor, Cairo or 
Port Said where they were collected, nor in Mentone, France, 
where additional specimens were secured. 

Reviewing the above, it will be noted, as indicated at the out 
set, that Culex pipiens Linne is the common house species in 
nearly every part of the world visited. It was* collected from 
below the equator, northward to a latitude of Newfoundland , 



OF WASHINGTON. 123 

and seems to be equally at home and abundant in all climes. It 
is undoubtedly the domestic mosquito pest of the world. 



The paper was illustrated by plain and colored photographs 
taken principally in Japan and China, showing the character of 
the country visited and various objects and places of interest. 



JUNE 5, 1902. 

The lyoth regular meeting of the Entomological Society of 
Washington was held at the residence of Mr. C. L. Marlatt, 1440 
Massachusetts avenue N.W. The chair was occupied by the 
President, Dr. Dyar, and there were also present Messrs. Ko- 
tinsky, Quaintance, Marlatt, Ashmead, Motter, Patten, Gill, Cur- 
rie, Benton, Heidemann, and Waite. 

Mr. Quaintance reported that he had observed the Periodical 
Cicada ( Cicada septcndecim] feeding quite generally upon ap 
ple, maple, ash, and Carolina poplar. He exhibited microscopic 
slides showing the seta from the proboscis of the cicada imbedded 
in the bark. He had seen these insects feeding that same morn 
ing, and had noticed that the plant juices exuded when the beak 
was withdrawn. Dr. Gill doubted whether the operation ob 
served by Mr. Quaintance could be strictly termed feeding, as 
the intestinal canal of adult cicadas was known to be aborted. 
Mr. Marlatt said that cicadas had not hitherto been definitely 
shown to feed in the ordinary sense of swallowing and assimilat 
ing food. He thought that the process could not be anything 
more than a tasting of the plant juices, and believed with Dr. 
Gill that the atrophied alimentary canal precluded the possibility 
of normal assimilation. He stated that a colorless liquid was 
exuded from the anal canal. 

Dr. Gill mentioned an early published reference to the Peri 
odical Cicada by one Peter Collinson, a correspondent of Lin 
naeus, who gave the interval between their appearances as fourteen 
or fifteen years instead of seventeen. The figure published with 
this reference resembles tibicen more than septendecim. 

Mr. Marlatt read the following papers on the Periodical 
Cicada :

NOTES ON THE PERIODICAL CICADA IN THE DISTRICT OF 
COLUMBIA IN 1902. 

By C. L. MARLATT. 

The holes of the periodical cicada began to be brought to the 
surface in numbers by the first of April, and the area under trees 
in the grounds of the Department of Agriculture, and of the 
Smithsonian Institution, was quite thickly studded with holes 
during the first week in April. The adults, however, did not 
begin to emerge until the second week of May, a few stragglers 
appearing at first, but from the loth onward emergence became 
rather general. Within the city very few of the cicadas which 
came out survived more than a few hours, being quickly snap 
ped up and destroyed by the English Sparrow. The numbers 
within the city were greatly diminished by the English Sparrow 
at the appearance 17 years ago, the destruction by this bird at 
that time having been noted by Prof. Riley and others to be very 
considerable. The sparrows' work this year, however, was 
much more effective, the cicadas being fewer in numbers ; and I 
doubt whether a single individual, certainly very few, ever 
reached the egg laying period. For two or three days in the 
midst of the trees on the Museum grounds a few song notes were 
heard, but ceased very soon. In the woods in the country about the 
city, especially out toward Chevy Chase, the cicada appeared in 
very considerable numbers, and here did not suffer very much from 
the attacks of birds, and for the most part went through the normal 
aerial existence successfully. The emergence was a prolonged one, 
and instead of being fairly complete in a few nights, as has some 
times been described, new cicadas were coming out in consider 
able numbers three or even four weeks after the first appearance. 
This was especially noticeable on the grounds of the Chevy 
Chase Club, where the insect appeared in perhaps greater num 
bers than at any other point observed. 

Another thing noted by many observers in the District, and 
also frequently by the writer, was that very many of the cicadas 
failed to free themselves from their pupal shells, and either died 
in the shells or went about for a day or two with the shell cling 
ing to the abdomen, preventing the wings from expanding. The 
reason of the extraordinary number of failures to transform suc 
cessfully does not readily suggest itself. It is possible that the 
very cold and late spring may have had something to do with it. 

Egg-laying began about June first, and continued with con 
siderable activity until the middle of June, and by scattering 
individuals even later. The egg-laying in the woods about Wash 
ington, especially on the higher grounds, was of sufficient amount 



OF WASHINGTON. 125 

to kill the terminal branches of the trees, in some cases almost 
all the branches dying, and many branches were broken off by 
the winds. They seemed to have a preference for small trees, 
and on young oaks and hickories the outer limbs were almost all 
killed back. This preference for small trees is probably due to 
their flying low, or perhaps liking to get out into the sun, but it 
possibly may have as a basis an instinct which leads them to select 
a tree just starting in life a's one which gives greater assurance of 
supplying the offspring with permanent subsistence. Trees 
bordering densely- wooded tracts were more oviposited in than in 
the interior of the woods. 

During the first week or ten days of the emergence of the 
cicada, a very large percentage of the small variety cassinii were 
observed. These, however, according to my observations in the 
District, did not remain long in evidence, but soon disappeared. 
They occurred in about equal proportion of both sexes, and 
mated. 

The different song notes of the cicada were more noticeable 
with this brood than has been my experience before in two other 
occurrences which I have witnessed. In other words, the three 
notes described by writers on the subject were all of them repre 
sented, and the two notes which are usually less common were 
perhaps in greater evidence than the common note made by this 
insect. In the case of another large brood witnessed by me, only 
the one note could be distinguished, viz, the song represented by the 
letters ts-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-ow, with the sound dyingaway. This 
year the broken and chipping notes were very shrill and loud, and 
very much in evidence, the chipping note being the characteristic 
one of the small variety. 

Nowhere outdoors in the District were any evidences of the 
making of cicada cones reported. Mr. Wm. Tindall, living on 
Washington Heights, at the northwest section of the city, dis 
covered some of these curious structures in his woodshed, and 
an investigation of the premises developed the fact that this 
woodshed was studded with cicada cones of perfect construc 
tion, varying from an inch to six inches in height. Evidently a 
tree had stood about where the woodshed was built, and the 
cicadas had undergone their development successfully in the 
ground beneath. All of those coming to the surface outside of 
the shed escaped through simple holes without any structures 
above ground; but every individual which came up within the 
shed built a turret or cone. The ground floor of the shed was 
somewhat moist, rain running under, but it w r as rather dryer 
than the ground outside, so that the cones could not have been 
built on account of the moisture. The only explanation which 
seems to offer for these cones is that the pupae coming up in the 
rather dark, poorly-lighted shed attempted to carry their holes 



126 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

farther up to get into broad daylight. This is a mere conjecture, 
and possibly wide of the mark. Certainly the occurrence of 
cones in this particular spot does not answer the explanations 
which have been offered heretofore to account for these curious 
structures. 

The cicadas disappeared, even in the woods outside the city, 
practically by about the 25th of June. ^ Eggs were very abundant 
on the trees, and hatching did not begin to any extent before the 
23d of July. A big transplanting of eggs was made from the 
surrounding forests of the District to the Department grounds, 
to afford material for studies in the development of the larvae. 
The planting was made in the oak grove on the west side of the 
Department grounds, where similar experiments had formerly 
been in progress. 



AN EARLY RECORD OF THE PERIODICAL CICADA. 
By C. L. MARLATT. 

earliest published account of the periodical Cicada which 
has come under my own observation was brought to my atten 
tion by Prof. E. A. Andrews, of the Johns Hopkins University, 
Baltimore, Md. It is contained in Volume I, No. 8. p. 137, of 
the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London, 
published January S. 1666. The portion of the communication 
relating to the Cicada is quoted below : 

" SOME OBSERVATIONS OF SWARMS OF STRANGE INSECTS AND 
THE MISCHIEFS DONE BY THEM. 

"A great Observer, who hath lived long in New England* 
did, upon occasion, relate to a Friend of his in London, where 
he lately was, That some few years since there was such a Swarm 
of a certain sort of Insects in that English Colony, that for the 
space of 200 Miles they poisoned and destroyed all the Trees of 
the Country 5 there being found innumerable little holes in the 
ground, out of which those Insects broke forth in the form of 
Maggots, which turned into Flies that had a kind of tail or 
sting, which they stuck into the Tree, and thereby envenomed 
and killed it." * * * 

The rest of the article referred to a plague of locusts (grass 
hoppers) in Russia, with which the Cicada is confused. The 
brood referred to here is very likely No. XIV, which appeared 
in 1651. No other brood coincides with this narrative and 
No. XIV not very closely, but as the quotation states the relation 



OF WASHINGTON. 127 

was " upon occasion," and was " some few years since," there 
is ample warrant for assigning the account to the brood of 15 
years before. 

Prior to the discovery of the above record the earliest pub 
lished account known was that referred to in my Bulletin 14 
(newseries), of the Division of Entomology, p. 112, given in a 
workentitled " New England's Memoriall," by Nathaniel More- 
ton, printed at Cambridge, Mass., in 1669. The work cited I 
was unable to get, but an account seen by me was a quotation 
from it published in Barton's Medical and Physical Journal of 
1804. The brood referred to by Moreton is undoubtedly the 
same one referred to above, but the occurrence of 17 years pre 
vious. Moreton, publishing of an event happening 36 years 
after it occurred, evidently made a mistake of one year, the occur 
rence not being 1633, as stated by him, but 1634. We have 
records of this brood in New England from 1787 to 1886, and 
another occurrence may be anticipated in 1903. The records, if 
any were made of it after 1651 and prior to 1787, have not been 
discovered. 



The Periodical Cicada was discussed further by Messrs. Qiiaint- 
ance, Gill, Marlatt, Waite, and Kotinsky. Mr. Waite stated 
that crows appeared not to damage the crops this year but 
seemed to feed principally on the cicadas. Mr. Marlatt exhibited 
photographs, taken in situ, of the cones in the woodshed above 
referred to and of imagoes on trees, and pupal shells adhering to 
the leaves, taken by Mr. Kotinsky and himself. 

Dr. Dyar showed a specimen of Acalla (jTeras) nigroline- 
ana Robs, from the Asa Fitch collection, probably taken in New 
York fifty years ago and labelled by Fitch kt Sarrothripa ? 
novceboracina" Another specimen of this species has recently 
been sent to the National Museum for name by Mr. H. D. Mer- 
rick ; it was taken in New Brighton, Pa. 

Dr. Dyar also showed specimens of moths from the Bumelia 
lanuginosa of Texas. Mr. Schwarz has discovered an interest 
ing fauna on this tree during his trips to that region, and he 
brought home from Victoria, Texas, three kinds of larvae, two 
of which have been bred and prove to be Litodonta hydromcJi 
Harvey and Euerythra phasma Harv. The third was a little 
squarish, slug-shaped larva with soft skin and black lines that 
must be that of Micza psammitis Zeller, as these moths were 
captured in the same locality. The only specimen that reached 



128 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

Washington was unfit to describe in detail. The Notodont larva, 
Mr. Schwarz says, was attenuated behind, green, marked with 
darker green. The anal feet were not raised. The head was 
rounded triangular, higher than wide, narrowed above, scarcely 
bilobed. The Arctian larva had a pale brown head and was 
covered with dense tufts of stiff, brownish hairs. Mr. Caudell 
is now in this region and may possibly secure more perfect ma 
terial of some or all of the species.* 

Dr. Dyar further showed specimens of the moth of Catastega 
timidella Clem., an inflated larva, pupa shells, larval work and 
a parasitic fly, Eulasiona comstockii Towns., bred from this 
moth. The genus Catastega was founded by Clemens on three 
larvse with peculiar habits, the moths of which were unknown 
to him and to all subsequent students. Stainton suggested in 
his edition of Clemens' papers, that the genus might belong to 
the PhycitidaB, a very plausible suggestion, as many Phyciticls 
have habits very similar to those described for Catastega. The 
only objection to this suggestion is that it does not agree with 
the facts. Mr. Busck has bred, on a different plant, a new 
species of Gelechia with Catastega-like habits. He had, there 
fore, concluded to refer Catastega as a synonym of Gelechia. 
But the same objection applies as to Stainton's suggestion. The 
moths are Tortricids. Catastegj timidella larvae occurred 
commonly on oak at Bellport, N. Y. The larvaB were matured 
in September or later and the moths emerged at Washington 
the following May. Unfortunately the two specimens obtained, 
both females, were considerably injured in a badly constructed 
cage, and Dr Dyar does not feel certain as to what known 
species they should be referred as imagoes. He suggested in 
regard to the other species of Catastega that C. haniameliclla 
Clem, might be Semasia argutana Clem, and C. aceriella 
Clem., Proteoptcryx spoliana Clem. 

Dr. Dyar showed specimens of two butterflies from the 
Olympic Mountains, Washington State, an Erebia and a Bren- 
this, sent to the National Museum by Mr. C. V. Piper. The 
Erebia is E. vidleri Elwes, hitherto only recorded from the 
Fraser river, British Columbia. The Brenthis may be identified

fying my identification. H. G. D.

as 13 '. chariclea Schneid. var. arctica Zett. It does not agree 
exactly with artica, being more variegated and brighter colored 
beneath, but it agrees still less with hclena, under which name it 
was sent, as the band on hind wings below is too dentated and 
variegated with white for that form. But as the synonymy of 
char idea is already considerably involved it is better not to add 
a new name to it. True chariclea seems not to occur in North 
America, but we have several forms which should be referred as 
varieties of it, as follows :

Dr. Dyar then read the following paper : 

THE LIFE HISTORY OF A SECOND EPIPLEMID. 
(Caflizzia amorata Pack.) 
By HARRISON G. DYAR. 

I have previously described, in part before this society (Can. 
Ent., xxx, 155, 1898 ; Proc. Ent. Soc. Wash., iv, 414, 1901), the 
life history of one species of Epiplemidae Cidlidapteryx dryop- 
terata Grote ; I am now able to refer to a second species, 
Calhzzia. amorata Pack., and show that it agrees in all those 
peculiar characters with the first known species. My acquain 
tance with C. amorata larva began in 1894 when I found a num 
ber of them on a wild honeysuckle bush at Keene Valley in the 
Adirondack mountains of New York. Only the smallest larvae 
are usually found on the leaves, the older ones become brown in 
color, and hide, probably at the base of the plant. So I saw only 
the small ones and thought the minute colorless larvae were some 
species of " Micro." and they did not interest me enough to 
seriously attempt to raise them. I did not see the species again 
till 1900, when I met with the larvae on the summit of Stony 
Man Mountain in the Blue Ridge mountains of Virginia. This 
time I quickly suspected their identity, but was unable to bring 
them to maturity. The next season Miss Wellesca Pollock 
kindly undertook to get some more from the mountain and she 
successfully carried them to the pupa stage. The moths 
emerged this Spring.

ened; soft, somewhat irregular in shape, the basal outline not always 
circular; about twenty vertical ribs, increasing confluently by many more 
at the flared base, confused with coarse reticulations at the vertex, which 
is sometimes ring-like; distinct, fine, parallel cross-striae, forming fainter 
reticulations at the vertex. Translucent white; diameter .5, height 
.4 mm. 

Laid scattering on the backs of the leaves, solitary, but many on one 
plant and perhaps none on the adjoining one. Larvae in various stages 
at the same time. 

Stage II*. Head rounded, whitish, eye black, mouth brown; width 
.3 mm. Body cylindrical, the feet normal; all translucent whitish, food 
showing green. No perceptible tubercles; setae fine white, moderate.

tinct incisures, joint 12 slightly enlarged. Tubercles a little elevated, 
colorless, transparent ; setae white, distinct. 

Stage IV. Head rounded, flattened before, bilobed, whitish, ocelli 
black, mouth dark brown; width .6 mm. Body thick, joint 12 a little 
enlarged, joint 13 small, subtruncate ; feet all equal. Translucent white, 
the elevated tubercles concolorous ; no marks. Setae white, distinct. 
Food green, but the blood is colorless. The larvae reach 6 mm. in length 
and are robust and thick. Dorsal vessel greenish. A few of the tubercles 
become finely black marked. Legs slender. 

Stage V. Head erect, slightly bilobed. flattish before; translucent 
white, vertex black powdered; ocelli black, labrum blackish, quadrate; 
width .85 mm. Body thick and robust, joint 12 slightly enlarged, feet 
normal, slender. Translucent white, greenish tinted, food green; edge

C. dryopterata. In Stage I the larva is entirely colorless, the food

A discussion then followed, participated in by Messrs. Ash- 
mead, Gill and Heidemann, upon the systematic value of 
characters furnished by the eggs of insects. 

Mr. Ashmead called attention to a valuable paper published 
by Mr. C. T. Brues in the American Naturalist for May, in 
which were descriptions of several new genera of flies, some 
new beetles and a curious new genus of Proctotrypids, all taken 
in connection with studies on the nests of Eciton. 

Mr. Marlatt recorded some observations made by Mr. 
Kotinsky and himself on the feeding habits of certain predaceous 
insects hitherto considered as beneficial, but which may have to 
be classed nither as injurious species. These observations were 
made in connection with the breeding experiments and studies of 
the imported Asiatic lady beetle (Chilocorus similis). In one 
of the outdoor breeding cages the larvae of Adalia bipunctata, 
a Coccinellid beetle, which commonly feeds upon aphids, oc- 



134 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

curred in great numbers feeding on the common plum aphis 
infesting the inclosed tree. These larvae were observed in one or 
two instances to eat the larvae of the Chilocorus, and when they 
were brought together in a jar the Adalia larvae attacked readily 
the younger larvae of the Chilocorus. While the normal food of 
the Adalia consists of plant-lice, it seems to have a rather general 
feeding habit, and very probably will eat anything of the insect 
sort which is alive and soft, including the larvae of its own species. 
Large numbers of the wheel-bug (Prionidus cristatus] were also 
found in the little Department grove, and these also were observed 
to feed on any scattering ladybird larvae which they came across, 
including Chilocorus. The wheel-bug never fed upon the scale, 
and its only function in the orchard was an injurious one, destroy 
ing the larvae of both the plant-lice and scale-feeding ladybirds. 
He referred also to the introduction of the European rear-horse 
(Mantis religiosd], which, as well as our native species, feeds on 
ladybird larvae. The larvae of a lace-winged fly (Chrysopa sp.) 
preyed also on the Chilocorus. Summing up these observations, 
he expressed the belief that all the insects mentioned, and other 
general-feeding predaceous species, ought perhaps to be classed as 
harmful rather than beneficial. The fact that they occasionally 
destroyed injurious larvae is scarcely to be taken into account for 
the reason that the larvae so destroyed are usually of species which 
are easily controlled by other means. The important point is 
that they destroy the larvae of insects such as the ladybirds, which 
prey naturally on classes of insects plant-lice and scale species 
which are with difficulty destroyed by artificial means. The 
position of the Adalia may, perhaps, be questioned in this regard, 
and probably under normal circumstances it confines its food 
pretty strictly to the plant-lice, and only attacks other soft-bodied 
insects in times of scarcity of its normal food. 



OCTOBER 16, 1902. 

The lyist regular meeting of the Entomological Society of 
Washington was held at the residence of Mr. Frank Benton, 
" Argyle," Fourteenth street extended, N. W. Dr. Dyar occupied 
the chair and Messrs. Marlatt, Gill, Waite, Hopkins, Barber, 



OF WASHINGTON. 



135 



Pollard, Schwarz, Benton, Caudell, Howard, Heidemann, Mor 
ris, Patten and Currie, members, and Messrs. Cundiff and 
Warner, visitors, were also present. 

Mr. Heidemann reported that he had collected, during last 
June and July, near Brightwood, D. C., two Fulgorids new to 
the District of Columbia, Phylloscelis pallescens Germar and 
P. atra Germar. Of the former species but one specimen was 
collected, but of the latter quite a series. Mr. Heidemann re 
marked that pallescens possessed venational differences from the 
other species of the genus, sufficient, he thought, to justify erect 
ing for it a new genus. 

Mr. Schwarz mentioned that during his recent collecting 
trip in Arizona he had frequently come across accumulations of 
insect eggs under- the bark of old pine stumps. At Flagstaff, 
Arizona, he found one such mass containing about one hundred 
eggs. These subsequently hatched into larva? of some longicorn, 
but what species it was difficult to say. There seemed to be but 
one longicorn beetle active there at that time, a Criocephalus 
which was observed in abundance under the bark running 
around and copulating. It seemed improbable that the eggs 
were laid the year before. They might belong to the Crioceph 
alus though they seemed rather too large for a beetle of that size. 
A specimen mass of the eggs was exhibited. 

Mr. Caudell stated that the type of the grasshopper Eritettix 
simplex Scudder, which has been lost sight of for some time, 
has lately been found by Mr. James A. G. Rehn of Philadelphia. 
Specimens collected by Mr. H. S. Barber in Arizona, on com 
parison with the type, have proved to be this species which 
must, therefore, be restored to our lists. 

Mr. Warner exhibited a twig of some plant, bearing a large 
number of seed vessels which were infested by some insect. 
The insects' holes of emergence seemed to be all on one side of 
the twig, and Mr. Warner wondered what side of the plant, 
bright or shady, was most favorable for their development. Mr. 
Schwarz said that in Arizona insects seemed to work perferably 
on the southeast side of plants and trees. He did no know, how 
ever, why such was the case. 

Dr. Hopkins showed specimens of the work of a bark beetle 
(Phlceosinus cupressi Hopkins, n. sp., MS.) in broken 



3 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

branches of the Monterey Cypress from the famous grove at 
Cypress Point, near Monterey, California. The natural distribu 
tion of this tree is restricted to a few acres in this one locality, 
but it has been extensively transplanted throughout Western 
California for hedges and ornamental purposes, thus extending 
the range of the beetle and enabling it to acquire the habit of at 
tacking other species of cypress and also the redwood. While 
the Phloeosinus does not seem to kill the trees and is compara 
tively harmless in the native grove, it has become a destructive 
pest under the influence of its new environment. The adults' 
habit of attacking and killing living trees and of feeding on the 
bark of living twigs is a characteristic which has not been ob 
served in any other species of this genus. 

Dr. Hopkins also showed the work of a species of Hylesinus 
in Red Fir from Port Townsend, Washington. This species 
has previously been found in White Fir. 

Mr. Marlatt noted that the common Dog-day Cicada ( Cicada 
tibicen Linn.) had given evidence of an important fall brood. 
Quantities of these insects had issued from the I5th of September 
into October. He had found on a morning three or four freshly 
emerged insects, not yet hardened, on the trunk of a single tree, 
and that under many trees in the Department grounds, and on 
his own premises, this late emergence had been in considerable 
numbers, indicating a really important fall brood. 

Dr. Dyar showed slides of the four larval stages and pupa 
of Dixa centralis Loew, with sketches of the larva. The larva 
is a surface feeder in stagnant pools and suggests Anopheles 
when it goes wriggling across the surface of the water. It has a 
sessile breathing apparatus as in Anopheles. The habit of the 
insect is to reach the edge of the pool or some floating object and 
squirm up to the very edge of the water film. It is furnished with 
five pairs of false feet, crowned by hooks, on abdominal seg 
ments i, 2, 5, 6 and 7 respectively. These enable it to climb up 
on the object it rests on to the very edge of the water. The 
larva rests curved like the end of an ellipse, and it progresses 
with the end of the loop foremost. This end is composed of the 
third and fourth abdominal segments and they are practically 
hairless. Long hairs arise from each end of the body which 
serve to hold the head and tail in position in the water, keeping 



OF WASHINGTON. 137 

them from moving backwards as the larva jerks first one and 
then the other forward. In feeding it bends the head at nearly 
right angles to the body and moves the mouth brushes and 
antennas rapidly. 

Dr. Dyar also showed the larval work of Argopistes scyr- 
toidesLec., a beetle inhabiting the lower east coast of Florida. 
He had collected these larvas in February, 1900, mining in the 
leaves of Forestiera porulosa, a large shrub, resembling the 
privet. The mine goes back and forth about the margin of the 
leaf, and the beetle larva transfers itself to a new leaf when one 
is emptied. The larva is flattened, pale whitish with an orange 
stripe about the subventral fold ; head and cervical shield 
blackish brown ; thoracic feet black ; no abdominal feet. The 
larvae transformed in the earth. 

He exhibited further a series of a Noctuid moth, showing 
much variety, collected on the sand dun'es at Santa Monica, Cal 
ifornia, by Mr. J. J. Rivers. The specimens seem referable to 
the very variable Carneades perexcellens Grote, but they differ 
from all the described forms of that species by the very pale 
hind wings, which run to almost immaculate pure white. It 
would seem admissible to designate this form by a new name, 
and it may be called var. riversii, in honor of the veteran ento 
mologist who collected it. 

Dr. Howard stated that drawings of Dixid larvas had been 
made by the late Mr. H. G. Hubbard. He had noticed the 
resemblance to larvag of Anopheles ; in fact an old drawing sup 
posedly Anopheles, had afterward proven to be Dixa. 

Mr. Schwarz, commenting on Dr. Dyar's note concerning 
Argopistes scyrtoides, said that he had beaten this flea-beetle 
from the dodder (Cuscuta} plant near Miami, Fla., while Mr. 
Hubbard had found it on the same plant near Jupiter, Fla. He 
stated that in some genera of the Chrysomelidae all the species 
have leaf-feeding habits, while in other genera certain species 
only feed upon the leaves, others live on the roots, or are leaf- 
miners. 

Mr. Schwarz exhibited a ball of pine resin collected by him 
in Arizona, which, upon examination, proved to be the nest of a 
bee of the genus Anthidium. The nest was preserved in the 
hope of rearing the bee and ascertaining its species. Instead of 



138 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

the bees, however, two specimens of a blister-beetle, Nemogna- 
tha nigripennis LeConte came out. Mr. Schwarz said that as 
far as known the species of Meloidse are either parasites of bees 
or grasshoppers. As a general rule those species which appear 
in the spring are bee parasites, while those which appear in the 
fall are parasites of grasshoppers. He expressed surprise that 
the bee could work in such a sticky substance as pine resin with 
out disastrous consequences. Mr. Benton said that he' thought 
it was not more difficult for this bee to work in the resin than 
for honey bees to handle the sticky propolis.

A CHALCIDID PARASITE OF THE ASIATIC LADY-BIRD. 
By C. L. MARLATT. 

A very important hymenopterous parasite must be added to 
the list of natural enemies of the Asiatic lady-bird ( Chilocorus 
similis). To our very great disappointment and astonishment 
early in September it was found that the pupae of the last brood 
were much parasitized, causing a loss of more than ten per cent, 
of this brood. As many as could be of these parasitized pupae 
have been collected, and from them has been reared a little 
Chalcidid fly, Syntomosphyrum esurus Riley, from five to seven 
parasites coming from each pupa. This insect belongs with a 
group of secondary parasites, but no trace of the primary parasite 
could I e found in any of the pupae examined, although later 
breeding may develop the primary parasite during the winter or 
next spring. The larvae were found free in the abdominal cavity 
of the Chilocorus pupa and ultimately all of the substance of the 
pupa disappears. In one or two cases where parasitism had only 
just begun to make itself evident, half-grown larvae were found. 
These were filled with the yellow fluid contents of the Coccinellid 
and were orange yellow in color. The older larvae in the nearly 
empty shells of the pupae were whitish in color. That all of 
these larvae are of the parasite mentioned above cannot be defi 
nitely said. Doctor Howard, who examined the material with 
the writer, is of the belief that the primary parasite will prove to 
be Homalotylus obscurus how., the common coccinellid parasite 
of this country. If the parasite bred proves to be a true second 
ary parasite, as believed, its presence in such numbers in the 
pupae of Chilocorus is a matter for gratification. If, on the con 
trary, it be a primary parasite, it seriously threatens the success of 
the imported Chilocorus and all allied lady-birds. The status of 
this parasite is given in the appended note by Dr. L. O. Howard. 

"All of the Tetrastichinae known and whose exact host rela- 



OF WASHINGTON. 139 

tions have been determined are hyperparasites. Syntomosphy- 
rum esurum Riley has never been proved to be either secondary 
or primary. It is, or was, a common parasite of Aletia argil- 
lacea in the cotton fields of the South late in the summer. It 
issued frequently and in great numbers from old chrysalids left 
hanging bare upon the cotton stalks. The chrysalids on being 
opened were found full of this parasite, and no trace of a prim- 
ary'parasite was ever found. Hence this insect was considered 
in Bulletin 3 of the U. S. Entomological Commission, and in the 
Report on Cotton Insects by J. H. Comstock, published by the 
Department of Agriculture in 1879, to be a primary parasite. 
The question as to whether it might not be a secondary parasite was 
raised by me in the 4th Report of the U. S. Entomological Com 
mission. It was reared, as recorded in Bulletin 5 (Technical 
Series), of this Division, by Dr. A. D. Hopkins, at Morgan- 
town, W. Va., from, Orgyia leucostigma. It was reared abun 
dantly in 1896, in the late winter and early spring, at Washing 
ton, D. C., from the chrysalids of Hyphantria cunea. Moreover 
it was reared by F. M. Webster in 1889 on May 3rd, according 
to the notes of the Division, from the galls of Trypeta gibbet 
Loew, on Ambrosia artemi sice folia. But these Trypeta galls, 
especially late in the season, are apt to contain several different 
kinds of insects, not only primary parasites but frequently lepi- 
dopterous, coleopterous and dipterous larvae, so that the rearing 
from the gall means nothing at all, the presumption, however, 
being that the insect came from the Trypeta either as a primary 
or a secondary parasite. 

Summing this evidence all up, we have the insect reared 
undoubtedly from lepidopterous chrysalids and from coleop 
terous chrysalids (that is to say, the Coccinellids under consider 
ation) and also possibly from dipterous insects. Unity of habit, 
that is to say, unity of host relation, is so marked among the 
Chalcididae that wherever such a diversity in the apparent hosts 
occurs it has become my rule to place such parasites as undoubt 
edly secondary or tertiary parasites. The primary parasites of a 
given group of insects belong to certain definite groups. Exam 
ples are so numerous that they need not be mentioned. In no case 
in the whole family, to my knowledge, are the parasites of a 
single genus parasitic on more than one order of hosts, and in 
some instances they are confined even to individual families of 
hosts, and the assumption that a single species of Chalcidid may 
be reared from coleopterous, from lepidopterous, as well as pos 
sibly from dipterous hosts, is almost an absurdity. These are 
the principal reasons upon which I base my belief that Syntomos- 
phyrum esurum is a hyperparasite." L. O. H.

NOTES ON MOSQUITOES IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. 
By HARRISON G. DYAR. 

These observations were made at Center Harbor, on Lake 
Winnepesaukee in the hilly part of New Hampshire, where I 
spent most of the summer of 1902. The lake has an altitude of 
500 feet above the sea and is a large body of clear, cold water. 
The land surrounding it is very hilly, almost-mountainous, sandy 
for the most part, with many rocks and boulders. A consider 
able part of the country is* forested, sheltering some spring pools 
and marshes. Other marshy places occur at the edges of the 
lake and in the lower, partly cleared woods. There are no 
streams in the immediate vicinity. 

Mosquitoes are not usually abundant. In fact this is one of 
the places described as "free from mosquitoes and malaria." 
However, in 1902 mosquitoes were abundant and troublesome, 
but only for about a month, from the middle of May to the mid 
dle of June, as I am informed. I reached Center Harbor on 
June 2oth. At that time only an occasional mosquito was seen 
about the house or in any open space, though in the woods they 
were still not uncommon. The commonest species was Culcx 
canadensis and next to that Culex reptans. That is at the time 
of my arfival. Later C. reptans gradually disappeared, being 
replaced in the same woods by C. triseriatus, which, however, 
did not become common. The other species were rare. Culex 
cantans was not infrequent in certain localities at the end of 
July. Culex pipiens did not occur. Mr. Coquillett at first identi 
fied two captured males as of this species, but a re-examination 
corrected the determination. Rain-water barrels and other 
likely places remained free from "wrigglers" all summer. 
Anopheles occurred, in two species, but not very commonly. 

Besides the collections made at Center Harbor, one day was 
spent at Durham, N. H., which resulted in adding two species 
to the list, C. sollicitans and C. pipiens. The latter was 
present at Durham in its usual abundance, and larvae were found 
in several places. Durham is situated at the head of tide water 
in low, nearly level farming land. It is seventy-five miles from 
Center Harbor in a straight line. 

Anopheles punctipennis Say. 

Larvas occurred in a rain-water puddle by the side of the road, 
but few of them matured, as the puddle dried, owing to the 
sandy soil. Other larvae were taken in pools containing algae, 
in low rocky islands in the lake, from a marshy pool of consider- 



OF WASHINGTON. 141 

able size in partly cleared woods and, as usual, from nearly 
every kind of water examined, but in no great abundance. 

Anopheles maculipennis Meig. 

This species was rare. Curiously enough, all the larvae found 
were alike and of a peculiar, striking coloration. They were at 
once separable from punctipennis by being black with a straight, 
narrow, white dorsal line, furcate on thorax. The white-spotted 
punctipennis were never marked w r ith such a uniform line. 

Culex canadensis Theob. 

Very common at first, gradually decreasing in numbers, but 
continuing all summer. Larvae occurred in a cold spring-pool 
in woods late in June, but they were not abundant, apparently 
most having completed their transformations. Others were taken 
in road-side puddles. A few stragglers occurred till the middle 
of July, but after that few more were found. Eggs were ob 
tained from females confined in jars; I did not find them in 
nature, though larvae in the first stage were several times collec 
ted. The eggs are probably laid in places where water is liable 
to collect, or in pools. In the latter case they sink and would be 
very difficult to find. The eggs from the females in jars were 
kept in water. One hatched immediately, two more in about a 
week, and another in two* weeks, but most of them remain un- 
hatched yet, apparently hibernating. They are laid singly. 

Culex reptans Meig. 

Perhaps about half as abundant as the preceding species. The 
occurrence was the same, principally a woodland species and 
only troublesome about the house at the period of greatest abund 
ance. No larvae were found, and I think that the species had 
ceased breeding before June 2Oth, when I arrived. The decline 
in numbers of the adults was even more marked than with C. 
canadensis, scarcely any being taken with the net after July 
i5th, though so common at first. The last ones taken had be 
come much worn. This is probably a truly single-brooded 
mosquito with the principal time of flight in June and without 
the continuous addition of a few fresh specimens as with C. 
canadensis. The fall and winter are probably passed in the 
egg stage. I neglected this species, having gotten the idea that 
it was common, and so failed to secure eggs. 

Culex cantans Meig. 

Rare in my usual collecting ground, a pine woods near the 
lake, but rather common about two miles distant in the low land 
between Lake Winnepesaukee and Lake Squam. Only adults 
were taken and these became much worn as the season advanced. 
This is another strictly single-brooded species with hibernation 
in the egg stage. No larvae were seen. Eggs were obtained 
from females confined in jars, but they all remained unhatched 
till the present time. 



142 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

The larvae referred to as cantans previously (Proc. Ent. Soc. 
Wash., v, 47, 1902) , should be attributed to the following species, 
C. sylvestris Theob. The larva of C. cantans is yet entirely 
unknown. 

Culex sylvestris Theob. 

A few examples only were taken with the net, but many were 
bred from larva?. The larvae occurred in all sorts of temporary 
pools, swamps and muddy roadside puddles alike. They 
occurred mixed with other short-tubed larvae, principally Culex 
canadensis and A'edes fuscus. These three species have essen 
tially similar habits. A roadside puddle was found filled with 
them ; when it had nearly dried, I collected the whole, leaving 
it empty. After the next rain it was again filled with these same 
three species (though less of the canadensis in proportion). 
Probably their eggs were lying at that place and some hatched 
after each rain. A large muddy puddle at Durham contained 
thousands of u wrigglers," and these were nearly pure sylvestris, 
as shown by breeding. 

Eggs were obtained from captive females, essentially like 
those of canadensis and cantans, laid singly and sinking in 
wa^er. They were obtained late in the season and have not yet 
hatched. 

Culex territans Walk. 

No- adults were taken with the net. I made a practice of 
taking all the mosquitoes that came to bite, but never saw a 
territans. Still the species was common, for the larvae occurred 
in every suitable pool and, after the middle of July, they were 
the most abundant Culex larvae to be found. They continued all 
summer. I am driven to the conclusion that C. territans 
does not bite. At Bellport, N. Y., where I met with it before 
(Proc. Ent. Soc. Wash., v, 48, 1902), I could not draw this 
conclusion, because C. pipiens, closely resembling it, occurred 
commonly, and it was impossible to catch all the mosquitoes 
that came to bite on account of their numbers. Still all the 
territans that I got at Bellport were bred. Eggs were not 
obtained from captive females. I have a female, still alive, that 
1 have had for nearly three months, which has refused to lay 
eggs. It will not bite, but feeds on sugar-water. However, I 
secured some egg shells from a small pool that was full of 
territans larvae, and I believe that they are the eggs of this 
species. They are deposited on the surface of the water in little 
boats composed of three or four eggs each, adhering by their 
flat sides, the mass floating sideways on the water. They are so 
minute as to entirely escape ordinary observation, and are only 
to be distinguished from the many little black specks floating on 
the water by examination with a lens. .The larvae pass four 
stages to the pupa, the life cycle occupying three weeks from 



OF WASHINGTON. 143 

egg to adult in warm weather. Breeding is continuous as with 
C. pipiens, and the winter is probably passed as adult. 

In common with other species of Culex which have the legs 
without white bands, territans larva has the antennal tuft be 
yond the middle of the joint and the part of the joint beyond the 
tuft more slender than that preceding it. The most marked 
differential character is the very slender, elongate air tube, which 
separates this larva from that of any other mosquito yet known 
to me.* In the first larval stage the antennal tuft is situated at 
the middle of the joint; but the normal character is gained at 
the first molt, though the white banding is often very incon 
spicuous until the last stage. Most of the larvaB taken were dark 
in color, heavily shaded with brown ; but some, from a sunny 
roadside puddle, were very pale, of a translucent white, with the 
chitinized parts light brownish. 

Culex triseriatus Say. 

A few examples were taken and others seen between June 
2oth and July 8th. After that they became somewhat more 
common, continuing all summer. No larvae were collected; 
eggs from captive females hibernated. The species seems, 
therefore, single brooded, but I cannot quite account for the 
fresh specimens that were flying all the season. The eggs were 
laid singly, adherent to the surface of the glass of the jar, just in 
the edge of the water. 

Culex melanurus Coq. 

This is a dark-legged mosquito and consequently has a long- 
tubed larva. The larva is very characteristic by its darkly 
infuscated tube and plates and its peculiar lateral comb of the 
eighth abdominal segment, which resembles a grating, the 
spines being in the form of long bars in a single row. It is 
slow in development and very deliberate in all its motions, 
remaining long at the bottom of the water. It inhabits per 
manent pools, spring pools or deep rock pools. The eggs are 
laid singly on the surface of the pool, where they float. The 
shell is black as usual, but so thin that the unhatched egg looks 
gray except at the poles. Breeding is probably continuous, with 
hibernation as adult, but the species was so rare that I did not 
follow it continuously. 

Culex dyari Coq. 

Three larvae, taken on the day of my arrival, in a cold, per 
manent spring pool, produced this species, and one specimen 
was caught afterwards. No more were seen. It is probably 
single brooded, an early spring brood with hibernation in the 
egg, as in C. reptans. 



*Except that of C. nigritulus, which I have received from New Jersev. 
This is very similar to C. territans. 



144 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

Culex restuans Theob. 

The larva occurred sparingly in permanent water both at 
Center Harbor and Durham. At the former place in spring 
pools, at the latter in a tub set in the woods for watering cattle. 
It greatly resembles that of C. pipiens, especially the pale form 
of that larva, but the outer part of the antennal joint is not 
shortened as is usual in the long-tubed mosquitoes, so that the 
tuft arises from the middle. This is a curious character, some 
what contradictory of the general characters of its group, but 
rendering its recognition easy. Only one adult was taken, a 
male, the species being rare. Breeding is probably continuous, 
with hibernation as adult. No eggs were obtained in New 
Hampshire, but I have found them at Washington, on my return 
in the fall. They are laid in large boats exactly as in C. 
pipiens. 

Culex pipiens Linn. 

As stated above, this species was absent from Center Harbor. 
It was not uncommon at Durham, and many normal larvae with 
the antennas completely infuscated were taken from a drainage 
ditch in a meadow. Other larvae from the cattle tub, mentioned 
above, differed in being much paler, causing the antennae to 
appear pale at the base, which led me to suppose that I was deal 
ing with a different species ; but Mr. Coquillett has examined the 
two bred series of adults and pronounces them alike. 

Culex atropalpus Coq. ^ 

Two small pools in hollows in the flat surface of a rock beside 
a stream in the woods on the side of Mt. Ossipee were exam 
ined in September. One contained a colony of C. territans, 
the other, three feet distant, contained this species. The larva 
resembles that of C. canadensis, but the tube is shorter, the anal 
plate smaller, and the anal finger-shaped processes contain con 
spicuous tracheae. In this particular colony these processes 
were enormously enlarged. The species did not occur near Cen 
ter Harbor (Mt. Ossipee is ten miles distant) ; there are no rock 
pools there. No adults were taken. 

Since my return to Washington, Mr. H. S. Barber has kindly 
shown me this species breeding abundantly in water-filled pot 
holes at the edge of the Potomac river above Plummer's Island, 
Md. It was accompanied by C. territans as in New Hampshire. 
Apparently C. atropalpus breeds only in these rock pools. 
Culex per turbans Walk. 

Several examples were taken in July, but the species was 
quite rare and I learned nothing about the early stages. 
Culex sollicitans Walk. 

One example, taken at Durham during the day spent there. 
The species was not seen at Center Harbor which is seventy-five 
miles from salt water. 



OF WASHINGTON. 145 

Uranotcenia sapphirina O.-S. 

Larvae were found rather sparsely in a marshy pool filled with 
grass and algae on July 25th, in all stages of development. 
They were in company with Anopheles punctipennis and Culex 
territans. The water of the pool was clear, but stagnant, the 
general environment being much as in the places where I found 
this species at Bellport, N. Y. (Jn. N. Y. Ent. Soc., ix, 179, 
1902 ; Proc. Ent. Soc. Wash., v., 49, 1902). My account of the 
larva in the New York Journal contains an error in the descrip 
tion of the first stage. The ventral tuft of the anal segment is 
stated to be present, but it is really absent, not appearing until 
after the first molt. The figure on the plate is correct. The 
pupa of this species is as small as that of Culex territans* but 
has even longer air tubes. It may be recognized by this char 
acter from other mosquitoes. 

Aedes fuscus O.-S. 

The species was not common on the wing. An occasional 
female came from time to time in the woods and was taken in 
the act of biting, continuing all summer. But many specimens 
were raised from Iarva3. The larvaa occur freely in temporary 
pools, especially road-side puddles, and are only occasionally 
found in permanent water. They were in company with Culex 
canadcnsis and C. sylvestris and, like them, possess a short 
breathing tube, which seems to be the structure adapted for larvae 
living in temporary pools. The larvae with long tubes generally 
live in permanent water. The larva of Aedes fuscus does not 
differ in structure from Culex. In fact it so nearly resembles C. 
sylvestris in all characters that they are difficult to differentiate 
specifically.

NOTE. Since these remarks were read, Dr. John B. Smith 
has published in Entomological Neivs a series of figures show 
ing the labial plate of a number of the species shown here. These 
should be consulted in this connection to show the variations in 
this structure in the same species. My plate shows the organ 
drawn to the same scale for all the species ; in Dr. Smith's plate 
this is not the case. It will be seen that there is considerable 
variation in absolute size as well as in shape in the different species. 
Some of the species have been drawn from more than one exam 
ple to indicate the individual variation. (See p. 153.) 

Dr. Howard congratulated Dr. Dyar upon the results of his 
studies of mosquitoes, and said that he would await with interest 
their publication, when he would have an opportunity of learning 
the results of his work more in detail than was possible in listen 
ing to the reading of the paper. He had visited Holland in the 
middle of last September, he said, and made some observations 
on the occurrence of mosquitoes there. These seemed not to 
breed in the large canals but in the ornamental fountains near 
houses. Anopheles was abundant in South Holland. Mr. War 
ner mentioned some mosquito observations of his, and Prof. Hop 
kins spoke of species he had come across on the Pacific Coast 
and in North Carolina.

The concluding paper was by Mr. Kotinsky, and entitled : 
THE FIRST NORTH AMERICAN LEAF-GALL DIASPINE. 
By JACOB KOTINSKY. 

While out collecting in the woods of the District on October 12, 
1902, 1 was attracted to an undersized tree, several leaves of which 
were literally covered with small galls. The underside of these 
leaves was dotted with white specks corresponding to the galls 
above, and under a magnifying lens the former proved to be the 
scales of a Diaspine. This brought to mind similar specimens sent 
by Mr. W. M. Scott, of Atlanta, Ga., the preceding July to the 
Department of Agriculture, which I had the privilege of examin 
ing. Subsequent search and study revealed the following facts : 
That the insects as well as the food-plant are identical with those 
of Professor Scott ; that the latter is the common sweet-gum tree, 
or bilsted {Liquidambar styraciflud}; that scarcely a tree was 
inspected but was more or less infested with the insect, and that 
the insect is referable to Cryptophyllaspis, Ckll. (Bull. 6, Tech. 
Ser., Div. Ent., U. S. Dept. Agr., 1897, p. 14), and is a species 
new to science. I therefore describe it herewith : 

Cryptophyllaspis liquidambaris, n. sp. 

9 gall. Mostly on upper side of leaf, .510 2 mm. high, bluntly conical. 

9 scale. Mostly on under side of leaf; waxy, central portion within 
the gall cavity a little beneath the level of the leaf surface; exuvium pro 
portionately large, lemon yellow, subovate, about .4 mm. in diameter, wax 
rim about .2 mm. wide. 

9 Subcircular, about .3 mm. wide and .4 mm. long; anterior \ of 
body, and the lobes smoky yellow and heavily chitinized; caudal end 
transparent, no circumgenital glands; dorsal pores few; a group of three 
in line with and cephalad of first incision, and three parallel to these 
from a point cephalad of second incision ; anal orifice 90 ^ from base of 
lobes, 45 ju. in diameter ; one pair of median lobes 12-13 M w ide at base and 
5-7.5 ju. intervening space, notched on each side, lateral notches lower than 
interior; two incisions each side of the lobes, the caudal larger, wall 
thickenings subequal in all. The plates are shaped like those character 
istic of Cktysomphalus spp., and are distributed as follows: two of the 
ordinai-y type between the median lobes; two of the Chrysomphalus type 
between each lobe and the first incision, and three between the first and 
second incisions; then there are also several dagger-shaped, beyond the 
second incision ; the spines are slightly longer than the lobes, and a pair is 
to be found just cephalad of each lobe and incision. This description is 
from several specimens mounted in Canada balsam.

$ scale. White, waxy, oval; yellow exubrium nearer the anterior end. 
These are usually found grouped about the glands that the leaf bears at 
each end of its veins. 

Habitat. On leaves of sweet-gum tree, or bilsted (Liquidam- 
bar styracijlud]. Mr. Bridwell tells me that Professor Scott 
found it also on twigs.

At first glance the mounted 9 looks very much like Aspidiotus 
rapax Comst., but its smaller size (about ^) immediately separates 
it from that species. Careful study of the plates will also show 
marked differences. I placed it in this genus owing to its gall- 
producing propensities, a characteristic of C. occultus Green, 
from Ceylon, on Gruvia orientalis, upon which Prof. Cockerell 
based this subgenus of Aspidiotus, later raised to the rank of a 
genus. This genus, besides the species above described and the 
generic type, now includes in addition C. riibsaameni Ckll., 
upon Codiceum from Bismarck Archipelago, and, as Prof. 
Cockerell kindly informs me in litt.^ " C. bornmulleri Rubs, 
from Madeira, on Globular ia salicina (Marcillia, I, 1902, p. 
62)." 

Prof. CockerelPs remarks in litt. with reference to my species 
are too interesting to be omitted. He says : u Cryptophyllaspis 
is a gall-making derivative of the type of Aspidiotus cyanophylli, 
or, more broadly speaking, of Diaspidiotus, Your description 
does not seem to contradict this view, except that the anal orifice 
is perhaps too large, and the single pair of lobes is peculiar. 
These last characters suggest ffemiberlesia, and I suspect that 
you have in reality a gall-making Hemiberlesia. In that case, 
your species cannot be a Cryptophyllaspis, however much it 
resembles one. * * * (See my remarks in Ann. Mag. Nat. 
Hist., July, 1902, pp. 40-41)." 

I am sorry not to have seen the description of Rubsaamen's 
species in order to see what relation it bears to the above. I may 
add in this connection that the species herein described is para 
sitized, though I have not bred the parasite as yet. 



NOVEMBER 6, 1902. 

The iy2d regular meeting of the Entomological Society of 
Washington was held at the residence of Mr. O. Heidemann, 700 
Newark street, Petworth. Dr. Dyar presided, and Messrs. Sher 
man, Hopkins, Busck, Gill, Kotinsky, Barber, Ash mead, Heide 
mann and Currie, members, and Mr. J. L. Webb, visitor, were 



OF WASHINGTON. 151 

also present. Mr. W. V. Warner, i522Kingman Place, N.W., 
was elected an active member of the Society. 

Dr. Hopkins, under the heading Short Notes and Exhibition of 
Specimens, showed some oak galls from black oak leaves, re 
ceived through the Secretary of Agriculture and Bureau of Plant 
Industry, from Mr. Geo. F. Richards, P. M., Westcott, Missouri, 
with the statement in Mr. Richards' letter of October 15, that this 
substance was very abundant in that section, and that cattle, hogs, 
sheep, turkeys and chickens were all very fond of it and were 
getting fat on it. Its resemblance to wheat grains and its nutri 
tive quality suggested to Mr. Richards the name " black oak 
wheat." 

The same kind of gall was later received from Mr. A. G. Tower, 
Texarkana, Arkansas, with the statement that hogs fatten on it, 
and it was known there as " wheat mass." 

The information relating to the nutritive quality of the gall 
suggested to Professor Hopkins the importance of having a food 
analysis made of it, and some of the galls were submitted to Dr. 
W. H. Krug, in charge of v the Dendro-Chemicai Laboratory of 
the Bureau of Chemistry, who analyzed it and submitted the 
following report : 

ANALYSIS OF GALLS BY DR. W. H. KRUG.

Ether extract 3.37 

Crude fiber (indigestible) 9.34

" The relative food value is high and the nutritive ratio is wide, show 
ing that this material is especially adapted for fattening animals. 

STARCH DETERMINATION OF GALLS AND RED OAK ACORNS. 

Size of starch grains : 

Red oak acorn 5.7 (1.7-18) M. 

Red oak galls 7.3 (2.6-12) M. 



152 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

Starch grains vary in form, the acorn starch being more or less elon 
gated in form and often somewhat truncated. They possess faint concen 
tric rings and a hilum marking which tends to be crescent-shaped. 

The gall starch grains are nearly spherical in form, occasionally trun 
cated, and usually have a strongly-marked stellate hilum. The rings are 
more strongly shown than in the acorn starch. Both varieties are rather 
strongly active toward polarized light. 

The starch grains from the galls resemble somewhat the reserve (?) 
starch of the woody tissue though the markings are rather more pro 
nounced." 

Dr. Hopkins stated that the galls appear to belong to a group 
designated by Osten Sacken as " swellings of the leaf, usually 
along the principal midribs, and containing numerous seed-like 
kernels." No specimens have been reared from the galls, but 
they appear to be the work of a species of Callirhytis. 

Another gall on oak twigs, from Miss Alice Eastwood, San 
Francisco, California, was exhibited, which contains hazelnut- 
like kernels which readily separate from the enveloping woody 
swelling. This gall was identified by Mr. Ashmead as probably 
belonging to the genus Callirhytis. 

In discussion Mr. Ashmead then stated that the gall-maker 
might not be a true Callirhytis but an Andricus. 

Mr. Busck stated that a box containing lost types of Clemens 
Tineids had recently been found in the Academy of Natural Sci 
ences, Philadelphia. As a result of this valuable discovery 
twenty species of Clemens, which have up to this time been 
only guessed at, are now definitely known from the type speci 
mens. 

Mr. Heidemann exhibited specimens of all stages of the 
Reduviid bug Apiomerus crassipes Fabricius. The larvas and 
eggs shown were received from Mr. F. C. Pratt, who collected 
them upon a leaf at Great Falls in Virginia. 

Mr. Busck exhibited some peculiar woody balls which he had 
found in nests of Eutermes in Porto Rico. In the majority of the 
nests they were not found, but in some they were very numerous. 
Prof. Hopkins said he thought that Mr. Pergande had hit on the 
right idea in believing that these balls were condensed, stored 
food material. 

Dr. Dyar showed mosquito eggs, presumably of Culex 
triseriatus Say, which had been collected by Mr. J. Turner 
Brakeley, of Homers Town, New Jersey, at his suggestion. Mr. 



OF WASHINGTON. 153 

Brakeley found the larvae of this Culex abundantly in a certain 
old iron kettle on his place in the summer of 1902, and Dr. Dyar 
thought that the eggs might be found by a careful search of this 
kettle, bearing in mind the habits of oviposition observed in 
captivity. Such proved to be the case, Mr. Brakeley rinding the 
eggs along the old water lines exactly as wcruld be expected. 
The kettle was dry at the time of examination, November 2. It 
had, however, been more or less full of water all summer and 
apparently for previous seasons. The eggs were found at the 
points where the water level had remained constant long enough 
to form rings on the side of the kettle, singly, in lines of three to 
ten, or in groups. They adhered firmly to the side, but could be 
detached by a forceps moistened in alcohol or with a stiff brush. 
It thus appears that Culex triseriatus passes the winter in the 
egg state, as has been inferred. The eggs sent by Mr. Brakeley 
will be submitted to culture experiments to see if they will 
hatch. 

Dr. Dyar showed also a set of photographs of lepidopterous 
larvae taken by Mr. A. Hyatt Verrill, of New Haven, Connecticut. 
Some of them showed the larvae somewhat enlarged, bringing 
out the general appearance very nicely. 

He showed further some drawings of the mentum of mo 
squito larvae, principally of the genus Culex, showing the modi 
fication in size and shape of this organ in the different species.* 
In Culex pipiens, C. nigritulus and C. dyari it is large with 
many teeth on the edge, the central tooth large and followed by 
small ones, again becoming large toward the base ; in C. terri- 
tans and C. melanurus the part is much smaller, the teeth fewer 
and larger, but of the same general arrangement ; in C. restuans 
it is very small, the teeth fine and uniform, deeply grooved 
basally. C. sylvestris, C. atropalpus, C. canadensis, C. 
tceniorhynchus, C. sollicitans, C. jamaicensis, Aedes fuscus 
and Stegomyia fasciata have the mentum large, broadly tri 
angular, the teeth usually small centrally,' becoming larger 
toward the base. Dr. Howard called attention to this structure 
last year ; it will probably prove useful in conjunction with the 
other larval characters, though comparatively difficult to observe.

trict of Columbia," was, in his absence, read by title.

NEW SMYNTHURID^E FROM THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA. 
By NATHAN BANKS. 

The spring-tails of the family Smynthuridae are the most inter 
esting forms of the order Collembola. They exhibit considerable 
diversity in structure and habits, and the species are mostly well 
marked. Several years ago I reported on the forms found on 
Long Island, N. Y. Since coming to Washington I have been 
on the lookout for them, and have taken a number of species, 
most of which were already known. Three, however, are dif 
ferent from any forms yet known from this country, and their 
descriptions are presented below : 

Dicyrtoma front alts n. sp. 

Head pale yellowish, a broad brown (nearly black) band connecting an- 
tennse and then extending back to the hind margin of the head, above a 
median black dot; in front across face is a broad brown band, the nasus 
below it being brighter yellow than the rest of the head; the thorax is 
pale, black-spotted on sides; abdomen above dark purplish thrown, and 
tubercle more reddish, and showing two pale spots above; basal joint of 
antennae dark brown, rest paler brown ; legs pale, rather brown on tips of 
joints; spring pale. Second joint of antennae long and slender, shorter 
than breadth of head, third about as long as the second, apparently divided 
into three subequal portions, last joint short, pointed; abdomen short, 
high, sloping suddenly behind, above beyond the middle is a distinct 
rounded tubercle each side, and a slight one in the median line behind ; 
furcula long, the dentes two and one-half times as long as the mucrones, 
with a few bristles below; mucrones finely serrate below, tip curved down 
ward; a few hairs on head, a few very short ones on posterior slope of 
abdomen, longer ones on anal tubercle. Length, 1.2 mm. 

Washington, D. C., January ; under leaves in woods. Readily 
known by markings of the head. 

Smynthurus facialis n. sp. 

Heal pale brown, with a transverse ivory whiie band, broadest in the 
middle and slightly pointed below, extending back below base of antennae 
to the abdomen; vertex with pale spots, a row of them connecting the 
bases of the antennae; each ocellus surrounded with white; basal joint of 
the antennae brown, with a white spot above, second joint brown at base, 
rest pale. Legs banded, femur with a dark band near the tip, three on 
tibia. Abdomen above white, the basal part with many small ivory white 
spots, arranged more or less in three rows, the middle one including a 
brown line; dorsum beyond the middle with irregular white, brown, and 
a few larger black spots ; anal tubercle above white, with a median black 
stripe; spring pale purplish; venter pale on apical part, darker on base.

Basal joint of antenna longer than broad, second joint twice as long as 
first, third one and one-half times as long as the second, fourth as long 
as the rest together, divided into 18 or 20 subjoints. Abdomen rather 
long; behind is a prominence each side; dorsum clothed with rather long 
hairs; furcula of moderate length, the dentes about four times as long as 
broad at base, with hairs beneath, mucrones about one-third the length 
of the dentes, finely serrate below. Length, 2. mm. 

Washington, D. C., under dead leaves, January. Separated 
from S. sylvestris by the markings of head and antennae, and 
dorsum of abdomen. 

Smynthurus trilineatus, n. sp. 

Pale; head and basal half of abdominal dorsum with three brown stripes, 
the lateral one passing through eye and base of antenna down upon the 
face, behind on abdomen they converge toward the middle; the middle 
stripe, which is narrower and with more even margins, on the head does 
not extend much beyond bases of antennae, behind reaching as far as 
lateral stripes; just beyond the ends of these stripes and across the mid 
dle of dorsum is a blackish band, behind which are two large submedian 
black spots, narrowly connected to a smaller median one behind on the 
anal tubercle, a few less striking ones on the sides; legs pale ; spring 
pale; antennas brown. Basal joint of antenna short; the second full}' 
twice as long; third one and three-fourths times as long as the second; 
fourth as long as rest together, with about 18 annulations ; dentes about 
three and one-half times as long as wide at base, with hairs below; 
mucrones fully one-third the length of the dentes, finely serrate below. 
Length, 1.6 mm.

REMARKS ON LIGYROCORIS CONSTRICTUS SAY AND DE 
SCRIPTION OF PERIGENES FALLAX, A NEW SPECIES. 

By O. HEIDEMANN. 

Some time ago in working on the group Myodocharia of the 
Family LygaBidae I found that my material of Liygrocoris con- 
str ictus Say, from Washington, D. C., Florida and Texas, con 
tained two different forms which I had formerly determined as 
belonging to one species. The mutual resemblance of the two 
forms is very striking. Anyone might easily be deceived, and it 
seems that this has often been the case, as the writer learned 
later through his correspondence on the subject. 



156 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

Originally the species was described by Say as Pamera con- 
stricta from the United States.* Stal placed Say's species in 
his genus Ligyrocoris.-\ The species of this genus are mainly 
characterized by having on both sides of the abdomen, at the 
base, a lunate vitta which is very finely striated and not pubes 
cent. 

Among my specimens I found some with a vitta and others 
without a trace of it. This made it impossible to decide which 
form really was the species Say had described, since his descrip 
tion fits both forms equally well and since he makes no mention 
of any vittae on the abdomen. Unfortunately Say's types have 
been lost, but many species in the Harris Collection at the Bos 
ton Society of Natural History are named by Say, according to 
Mr. Ph. R. Uhler, who years ago worked up and arranged this 
collection.]: Mr. Uhler cites Say's species Pamera constricta 
as belonging to the genus Ligyrocoris Stal, referring to No. 
122, Harris Collection, Milton, Aug. 15, 1831, " determined as 
Pamera constricta by Mr. Say" (1. c., p. ^89). Mr. S. Hen- 
shaw, of the Museum of Comparative Zoology, Cambridge, 
Massachusetts, has been kind enough to compare the two differ 
ent forms with the specimen in the Harris Collection. His an 
swer reads as follows : "Harris' specimen is badly eaten, but 
there is enough on one side to show the vitta on that side." 
This might settle now any doubt as to the determination of Say's 
Ligyrocoris constrictus. ' , 

I was puzzled for some time as to where I should properly 
place the specimens without a lunate vitta, until I found in the 
Biologia Centrali-Americana a description by Mr. Distant of a 
new genus, Perigenes, based on the new species P. dispositus 
from Guatemala. The description of the genus is very short 
and concise: " Form and shape of Ligyrocoris Stal, but with 
out the lunate vittae to the under surface of the abdomen ; poste 
rior legs shorter ; antennas shorter, the third joint with the apex 
distinctly incrassated." Following this description I have no 
hesitation in placing my specimens in this genus, but I venture 
to describe this form as a new species on account of some differ 
ences, even if these are but slight.

thorax piceous. Antennae very hairy, terminal joint sericeous pubescent ; 
basal joint short, second joint longest, about twice the size of the basal 
one, third joint one-fourth shorter, the ultimate one a little longer than 
the third; color ochraceous, darker at the tip of joints and at basal part 
of the first joint. Rostrum dark, reaching to the intermediate coxae. 
Sternum, pleural pieces and scutellum dull black, also the thorax, except 
at posterior margin which is fuscous, smooth and slightly sinuated. 
Hemelytra dark brown or reddish brown ; costal margins ochraceous, at 
apex clouded, sometimes also before it; at the inner margin of corium are 
two yellowish white spots. Membrane smoky, at base a few irregular or 
lunate whitish- marks. Lighter colored specimens show near the suture 
of corium and on the clavus two ochraceous very short lines longitudinally. 
Legs highly polished, densely set with fine, long hairs, on-the tibiae a few 
remote spines ; front femora beneath at apex with a strong spine, before 
it a smaller one, color piceous, except at base and tip; middle and hind 
femora with a broad piceous band before the apex ; the base and tip of 
tibiae clouded with fuscous, as are also the last tarsal joints. Wings irn- 
descent. In the male, which is considerably smaller, the legs are more or 
less ochraceous and the femora without a piceous band. Length 5.7 mm. 

Type. No. 6617, U. S. National Museum. One male and 
one female from Washington, D. C., collected by the author on 
September i and 4, respectively. 

This species is widely distributed. I have seen specimens 
from Buffalo, New York, Texas and Los Angeles, California. 
It differs from Perigenes dispositus Distant in the colors and 
somewhat, also, in the length of the antennal joints. 



The paper was discussed by Messrs. Ashmead and Hopkins. 
Mr. Ashmead thought that the so-called types of Say in the Har 
ris collection should be accepted as such when they agree with 
the published descriptions, otherwise not. 



DECEMBER 4, 1902. 

The 1 73d regular meeting was held at the residence of Mr. C. 
L. Marlatt, 1440 Massachusetts avenue, N.W. President Dyar 
occupied the chair, and Messrs. Morris, Simpson, Busck, War 
ner, Patten, Uhler, Howard, Schwarz, Pollard, Barber, Kotinsky, 
Currie, Benton and Stiles, members, and Messrs. H. E. Burke 
and J. L. Webb, visitors, were also present. The minutes ot 
the last meeting were read and approved. 

Dr. Stiles referred in terms of high praise .to the scientific 
work of the late Major Walter C. Reed, Surgeon in the United 



158 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

States Army, mentioning in particular his investigations in Cuba 
as a member of the Yellow-fever Commission with reference to 
the relation of the mosquito Stegomyia fasciata to that disease. 
He then moved that the Chair appoint a committee of three to 
draw up suitable resolutions relative to Major Reed and his 
work, these resolutions to be sent to the family of the deceased 
and printed in the minutes without further vote by the Society. 
The motion was carried, and Messrs. Stiles, Howard and Ash- 
mead were appointed subsequently. 

The Committee presented the following resolutions : 
Resolved, That the Entomological Society of Washington 
herewith expresses its keen appreciation of the great loss Ameri 
can science, and particularly American preventive medicine, has 
sustained in the death of Major Walter Reed, Surgeon United 
States Army. Although not a zoologist, he has been pre-emi 
nent among physicians in making practical application of zoologic 
knowledge in saving human life, and his discovery and demon 
stration of the transmission of yellow fever by mosquitoes belong 
ing to the species Stegomyia fasciata must take rank scientifically 
as one of the most brilliant, and practically as one of the most 
important discoveries ever made in applied zoology. 

Resolved, also, That we heartily endorse the idea that Congress 
be urged to make ample provision for the support of Doctor 
Reed's widow and daughter. Had Doctor Reed been in private 
practice or on the faculty of the medical school of an endowed 
university, his income would have been much larger than that he 
received in the Army. Had he discovered some mechanical 
device which could in anyway compare in importance, in saving 
lives and property, with the discovery he made in regard to yel 
low fever, he would have realized financial benefits which would 
have made him a multi-millionaire, and even if Congress should 
vote an unusually generous pension, the sum could represent only 
an infinitesimal interest on the money which Doctor Reed's 
medico-zoological discovery will save this country and other 

countries. 

Resolved, further, That this Society express to Mrs. Reed its 

sympathy in her bereavement.

Professor Uhler was then called upon to address the Society. 
In responding he gave the results of his observations upon the 
Periodical Cicada in the vicinity of Baltimore, especially during 
the past season. The cicadas, he said, were first observed on the 
27th of May. in Baltimore, in the neighborhood of Druid Hill 
Park. From that time on they appeared in increasing numbers 
until the iSth or 2Oth of June, at which time they were extremely 
abundant In fact, he was informed by one whom he regarded 
as a reliable authority that 39 cart-loads of these insects were 
carried away from the park grounds. 

Professor Uhler stated that he had in his possession two speci 
mens of this cicada collected in 1783. They were given him 
many years ago by the son of the well-known collector Mr. Wilt, 
who came to this country in 1782. He also had in his collection, 
besides the specimens collected during the past season, some 
examples from the previous appearances of the brood, in 1851 
and 1868. 

He mentioned the singular fact that he had found this cicada 
appearing at the same localities every year for five consecutive 
years after 1885 on the Belair and Harvard roads to the northeast 
of and within three miles of Baltimore. 

In regard to the form cassinii, Prof. Uhler said that he had 
collected large series of cicadas ranging in size all the way from 
the smallest specimens to the largest of typical septendecim. and 
he had found that the abdominal colors varied. In addition to 
this the song-notes which were thought to be peculiar to each 
form were found to be used by both. There no longer, there 
fore, appeared to him any reason for considering the form cassinii 
as valid. Cassinii has been reported as appearing somewhat 
later than typical septendecim, but he had found it throughout 
the season, both early and late, and he thought it noteworthy 
that he had found it at Pen Mar, Maryland, as late as the early 
part of August. 

Speaking of the mounds or turrets, Prof. Uhler said that those 
he saw differed from Prof. Riley's published figures in that the 
hole of emergence was never at the side or bottom, but always at 
the top. The turrets were found only in certain localities and 
under hemlock and balsam, not under oak trees. 

Mr. Marlatt said that he agreed with Prof. Uhler as to the in- 



160 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

validity of the form cassinii. He also had always found the hole 
at the top of the turret and never at the side. He referred to his 
notes on the periodical cicada given at the meeting last June and 
the general discussion of these insects which then took place. He 
stated that Mr. Wm. T. Davis collected specimens of this cicada 
upon Staten Island nearly every year. 

Prof. Hopkins said he had been led to believe that septendecim 
appears every year in certain localities of West Virginia. 

Mr. Schwarz stated that he had seen the turrets from Missouri 
from which the figures published by Riley were made. He 
remembered that several of them had a hole on the side as shown 
in the figure. There was no brood of this cicada, he said, on 
the Rio Grande in Texas, though it had twice been recorded from 
there. Both these records, however, were based upon another 
species, which comes up in enormous numbers in that part of the 
West at the time that septendecim emerges in the East. He 
mentioned the fact that Prof. John B. Smith had observed a cer 
tain species ovipositing in a rotten stump. The species found at 
Williams, Arizona, Mr. Schwarz said, oviposits in oak twigs, 
and is as fatal to the twigs as is our septendecim. 

Mr. Morris called the attention of the Society to a work 
entitled, " Galls and the Insects Producing Them," by Melville 
Thurston Cook, parts I and II of which have recently appeared 
as Bulletin No. 15, Series 6, of the Ohio State University. 

Dr. Dyar showed mosquito larvae collected by Messrs. 
Schwarz and Barber at Williams, Arizona, early in June, 1901. 
It is probable that they are Culex hicidens Thomson, since the 
imagoes of this and C. varipalpus Coquillett were the only 
species taken at that place, and the latter is a small fly, not 
attributable to this large larva. The larva belongs to the short- 
tubed group, and is allied to canadensis and atropalpus by its 
large comb of the eighth segment consisting of a large patch of 
many little spines. It differs from these species and also from 
all other mosquito larvae yet seen by the pecten of the air-tube 
being formed of a row of hairs instead of the usual short-toothed 
spines.* 



* Since this note was read, apparently the same species of larva has 
been received from Messrs. Dupree and Morgan, labelled Culex consobri- 
nus. Consobrinus occurs in Arizona in all probability, since the National 



OF WASHINGTON. 161 

Mr. Schwarz exhibited specimens of the Ptinid beetle, Tri- 
gonogeniiis farctus LeConte, from San Francisco, Cal., and T. 
globulum Solier, from Chili, in order to prove the specific iden 
tity of the two. He called attention to his note published in the 
Canadian Entomologist, where the habits of the species were 
mentioned. It has been found in red pepper and other drugs in 
California and British America, and he had at that time called at 
tention to the fact that the species was probably an introduced one. 
He also called attention to a note in the Entomologists' Monthly 
Magazine for March, 1900. where Mr. B. Tomlin records the 
occurrence of this species in England among refuse of grain. 

Mr. Marlatt recalled a communication presented by him 
before the Society several years ago, in which he pointed out the 
danger of describing as new species specimens of scale insects 
which varied in color only from old species. As illustrating the 
wide range of such variations he exhibited some specimens of 
the San Jose scale. One of these was a peach twig recently 
received from a correspondent, completely massed and covered 
with scales, most of which were of a chalky or almost snow- 
white color. This was especially notable on the side of the limb 
most exposed to the sun, and all of the scales on the limb, under 
neath as well, were much whitened. If the character of color 
were given relative value in this case it would result in a distinct 
species, if not a new genus. On this twig were patches where 
the scale presented nearly the normal appearance, and in other 
places were all the variations between the white and the normal 
color of the scale. He also exhibited some pear leaves on which 
the San Jose scale, chiefly male scales, were of a very light buff, 
and stated that he had noticed during the summer that the insects 
that went out on the leaves developed scales of this color in life, a 
characteristic which is widely divergent from the normal type of the 
species, and would never be recognized as belonging to the San 
Jos scale. More striking examples of wide variations in color 
of a scale he had never seen, and both of these specimens illus- 



Museum has specimens from New Mexico and Chihuahua, whereas t'nci- 
dens is unknown in the East. Therefore, cousobriiius is a more probably 
correct identification of Messrs. Schwarz and Barber's larvae. 

Consobrtnus belongs to the short-tubed group only by reversion in the 
last stage, as will be more fully discussed elsewhere. H. G. D. 



162 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

trated the danger of depending on color for the identification of 
species or for characterization. In this case it was especially 
notable because the San Jose scale is, as a rule, rather uniform 
in its colorational features. 

Then Dr. Howard, under the title " Gossip about a European 
Trip, more or less entomological," gave a rapid but entertaining 
outline, illustrated by numerous photographs, of his travels in 
Europe during the past summer, particularly in France, Italy, 
Austria, Germany and Holland. He gave his impressions of the 
various entomological and other scientific institutions visited, of 
their work and of the workers themselves. Among many items of 
interest may be mentioned his account of the precautions taken 
in the malaria-infested regions of Italy to protect the inhabitants 
from mosquitoes. 

At the conclusion of Dr. Howard's talk, Mr. Schwarz asked 
him if he agreed with the statement which Mr. Marlatt had made 
upon returning from his European trip, that injurious insects 
were much less numerous in Europe than in our country. Dr. 
Howard replied that he did, most emphatically. 

Mr. Caudell presented the following paper for publication : 

SOME NEW OR UNRECORDED ORTHOPTERA FROM 
ARIZONA. 

By A. N. CAUDELL. 

In a collection of seventeen species of Orthoptera, received 
from Dr. R. E. Kunze, of Phoenix, Arizona, occur two new 
species and a few others of considerable interest by reason of 
their rarity or by their having been previously unrecorded from 
that Territory. Following is a list of the species represented, 
together with descriptions of those which are new. 

Orphulella compta Scudd. 
Ligurotettix kunzei sp. nov. 

Head large; fastigum moderately sulcate, more so in the male, very 
slightly carinate centrally, or there tumescent; lateral foveolae quadrate; 
frontal costa flat, very slightly sulcate .-just below the ocellus, broad, 
nearly as wide as the interspace between the eyes. Eyes prominent, a 
little elongate, slightly longer than the infraocular part of the gense. 
Antennae slightly thickening clistally, apically acuminate, longer than 
the head and pronotum. Pronotum widening irregularly from in front 
backwards, obtusangulate behind, subtruncate in front; median carinse

persistent, less distinct between the sulci ; lateral carina present only 
posterior to the principal sulcus ; lateral lobes vertical, the posterior 
angles rounded. Elytra and wings slender, reaching about one-fourth 
of their length beyond the end of the posterior femora. Hind femora 
considerably compressed, the upper margin more curved than the in 
ferior. 

Color brown, mottled quite uniformly with fuscous, lighter in the 
male and much less maculate with fuscous, almost uniformly light grayish- 
brown. The head has an obscure postocular band and the upper part of 
the lateral lobes is somewhat infuscated, scarcely so on the metanotum, 
scarcely noticeable in the male. Abdomen much lighter in color than the 
rest of the body. Elytra in the female considerably flecked with fuscous, 
in the male almost immaculate. Posterior femora brownish externally, 
paler towards the tip, except the upper half of the genicular arc 
which is piceous, internally the geniculation is wholly black and the 
face is marked with one distinct and one imperfect black band dividing the 
surface into three nearly equal parts, the imperfect band being basal and 
not showing on the dorsal surface of the femora, while the perfect band 
continues over the dorsal surface and slightly onto the outer face, neither 
band showing in the ventral sulcus, which is uniformly light brown. 
Hind tibiae dull yellow with a small black spot at either extremity below. 

Length, body, <^\ 17 mm., 9> 2 4 mm.; antennae, rj\ 6 mm., 9' 6.5 
mm.; elytra, ^, 16 mm., 9> 2I -5 mm.; hind femora, rj\ g mm., 9> ll 
mm. 

Type No. 6705, U. S. National Museum. 

One male and one female from Phoenix, Arizona, collected 
September 10, 1902. 

This species is very like Ligurotettix coquilletti, but is much 
more slender, lighter in color, and the posterior femora are not 
so distinctly banded above. The measurements are also consid 
erably greater. 
Encoptolophus subgracilis sp. nov. 

Head moderately large, about as broad as the posterior part of the 
pronotum ; eyes quite prominent, about as long as the infraocular part 
of the genae and generally with a more or less distinct fuscous band 
running horizontally across the middle, especially in the male. Vertex 
about as broad as one of the eyes, furnished posteriorly with a very 
distinct carina, the margins well elevated, converging in front to form 
the sides of the frontal costa, which is moderately narrow, approximately' 
half as broad as the interspace between the eyes, equal in the female, 
narrowing apically in the male, quite deeply sulcate, especially at the 
ocellus, and below just failing to reach the clypeus. Antennae short, 
very slightly broadening apically, at least in the female. Pronotum 
more slender than usual in this genus, broader behind and with the 
lateral lobes almost perpendicular and more angulate behind than 
usual in allied species ; median carina better developed than in palh'dus, 






164 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

the nearest allied species, but in no sense cristate, evenly elevated and cut 
slightly before the middle; lateral carina distinct, fading anterior to the 
principal sulcus. Elytra and wings of equal length, considerably surpass 
ing the posterior femora, the elytra more slender in proportion to their 
width than usual in members of this genus. Posterior femora broad ba- 
sally, about equally rounded above and below, not or but little passing the 
tip of the abdomen in either sex, the carinse well elevated. 

Color dark brown, mottled with fuscous. Head dark brownish, fuscous 
above, somewhat lighter on the sides and in front and furnished with an 
obscure postocular band, which, especially in the male, extends across 
the middle of the eye. Pronotum colored as the head with the inferior 
border of the lateral lobes lighter. Abdomen light yellowish brown, 
somewhat infuscated basal ly above. Elytra with the usual fuscous mark 
ings but somewhat less conspicuous than usual. Wings hyaline with the 
stigma deeply infuscated. Posterior femora quite uniformly brown ex 
ternally with a somewhat obscure pallid pregenicular annulation ; inter 
nally black with two light bands, one preapical and one median. Hind 
tibiae greenish blue, the basal third pallid. 

Length, body, <j\ 18 mm., 9> 2 5 mm. ; antennae, /^, ?, 9,6 mm. ; ely 
tra, cf, 16 mm., 9> 1 9 mm. ; hind femora, $, 10 mm., 9? I2 mm. 

Type No. 6704, U. S. National Museum. 

Two males and one female from Phoenix, Arizona, collected 
October 27, 1902. 

This species is most nearly allied to Encoptolophus pallidtls 
Bruner, from California, but the color is darker, in this regard 
standing between that species and costalis, and the general form 
is much more slender. It differs from costalis in its slenderer 
form, less conspicuously marked elytra and smaller size. When 
a number of specimens are examined there will probably be some 
variation found to exist in the length of the antennae, this being 
the case with E. pallidus. 

Trimcrotropis vinculata Scudd. 
Conozoa behrensi Sauss. 
Anconia Integra Scudd. 
Schistocerca shoshone Thorn. 
Schistocerca vega Scudd. 
Melanoplus aridus Scudd. 

There are nine specimens of this species in the collection and 
one, a female, is quite noticeably tinged with green. 

Melanoplus broivnii Caud. 

These specimens, eleven in number, agree with the type speci 
mens except that the posterior tibiae are bluish in color. The 
tibiae of the types may have been faded in color. 

Melanoplus dijferentialis Thorn. 
Melanoplus Jlavidus Scudd. 



OF WASHINGTON. 165 

Melanoplus herbaceus Scudcl. 
Melanoplus pictus Scudd. 
Melanoplus yarro-wii Thorn. 

This species is represented by eighteen specimens, several of 
which are tinged with greenish. 

In a small collection of Arizona Orthoptera, made by Mr. E. 
A. Schwarz some years ago, mostly in Madera canyon in the 
Santa Rita Mountains, are some quite interesting forms. The 
most interesting of these are here noted. 

Vates sp. 

An immature specimen belonging to the genus Vates occurs 
in the collection. It is too young to permit of a specific determi 
nation, but there is no doubt of its belonging to this genus. 

Litaneutria spp. 

In this collection occur six male specimens belonging to the 
genus Litaneutria. They evidently represent two species, but 
the condition in which the species of this genus have been left by 
Professor Scudder's insufficient descriptions* makes their deter 
mination impossible without an examination of the type speci 
mens. 

Ischnoptera uhleriana Sauss. 

A male from Madera canyon is somewhat larger than those 
commonly taken in the East, measuring 18 mm. in length of 
elytra. 

Latindia sckivarzt sp. nov. 

Testaceous, head brown. Thorax transversely elliptical. Elytra long, 
veined as in L. delicatula. Wings hyaline with an opaque infuscated area 
beyond the middle of the costal margin, at rest reaching slightly beyond 
the tips of the elytra. Cerci about as long as the pronotum, curved so 
strongly downwards as to almost form a circle. 

Length, pronotum, 1.5 mm., elytra, 7 to 8 mm., width, pronotum, 2.25 
mm. 

Type No. 6706, U. S. National Museum. 

Three male specimens from Madera canyon, Santa Rita 
Mountains, collected June 8 and July 7, 1898. 

This species is very closely allied to L. delicatula, from 
Guatemala, the main differences seeming to be the longer wings 
and the less infuscated state of the under wings. 

Myrmecophila for mi car um Scudd. 

Two specimens of this species were taken in Madera canyon 
with Camponotus sp. This seems to be the first published record 
of any species of this genus being taken in Arizona. 

*Can. Ent., XVIII, p. 209, 1896. 



166 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

OEcanthus argentinus Sauss. 

Specimens of what I take to be this species were taken at 
Oracle, Arizona, and also at Hot Springs, by Mr. H. S. Barber. 
These specimens have a single straight line on the inner side of 
the first and second segments of the antennae, and the wings are 
caudate. From the original description and the later treatment 
of the species by its author in the Biologia Centrali-Americana 
there appears to be considerable variation in the length of the 
wings and the markings of the antennas. There is some varia 
tion in the antennae, of the specimens before me, some having 
unicolorous antennas with scarcely a mark except the straight 
dash on the two basal segments, while others have several seg 
ments beyond the second deeply infuscated and the markings on 
the first and second segments of variable distinctness.

SOME RECENT WORK IN NORTH AMERICAN 
LEPIDOPTERA. 

By HARRISON G. DYAR. 

Ten years ago the classification of the Lepidoptera stood 
essentially as in the time of Linnaeus. In Smith's list of 1891 
we still have the two large divisions into Rhopalocera and 
Heterocera, the former corresponding to Linnaeus' Papilio, the lat 
ter to his Sphinx and Phalaena. While the Sesiidaa and Syntomidas, 
placed in Sphinx by Linnaeus, have been removed from that 
group, they were still found immediately following it. Some 
suggestions on right lines have been made from time to time, 
such as that of Butler, who, many years ago, claimed a position 
in the Tineids for the Sesiidae ; but such suggestions have not 
been generally followed. 



168 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

Recently it has been shown that the classification of the Lepi- 
doptera must be materially changed to accord with the probable 
evolution of the families and genera. Fortunately the general 
order of Linnaeus will not have to be greatly modified. The 
transference of a few families and a division of the group called 
Phalaena by Linnaeus will suffice. The studies of Meyrick, 
Hampson, Chapman, and Tutt in England, and of Comstock, 
Packard, Kellogg, Bodine, and the writer in America, have con 
verged to a common general scheme, though the details still differ 
in the conception of the several authors. This general subject 
is so fully discussed by Tutt (Brit. Lep., I, chapter ix, 1899) that 
I will not enter upon it further, but refer to the more special 
work accomplished by American students. 

The last decade has seen the close of the labors of two 
great students of the butterflies, S. H. Scudder and W. H. 
Edwards. Dr. Scudder's work is widely recognized as most 
excellent. It is extremely full in detail and accurate, even in 
points to which attention had not at the time been directed. If 
we may presume to criticise this master of his study, we would 
say that the chief faults are, first, the use of too small characters 
in defining genera and groups, characters which are either vari 
able or not easily appreciated, together with a certain indefinite- 
ness in synoptic tables which renders them difficult to use ; 
second, generalizations from too few known species, causing 
specific characters to appear as those of higher groups. 

Mr. Edwards has been first and foremost a describer of species. 
He is responsible for the bulk of the specific names of North 
American butterflies. That he carried his work too far and named 
as species a number of forms of only varietal or racial rank is 
probably true, yet it is difficult to point out just what names 
should be united. The difficulty is especially apparent in the 
genus A.rgynnis with its great variety of forms and their almost 
imperceptible differences. Mr. Edwards named everything in 
this genus as a species which differed, however slightly, from his 
known specimens. Nearly everyone agrees that there are too 
many names, but no two will agree which names are of varietal 
rank. Mr. H. J. Elwes, of England, tried to improve the names, 
and later Mr. A. J. Snyder has attempted the same thing. Both 
seem to have failed. Mr. Edwards not only published descrip- 



OF WASHINGTON. 169 

tions, but most excellent figures of his species. To this is added 
his widely known work on the larvae, in which many points of 
both special and general interest appear. His chief fault is that 
he never correllated his work. He never published any synoptic 
tables, though his work is partly systematized by his catalogue. 
Neither by any one else have the North American butterflies been 
properly placed together and studied. Scudder's remarkable 
work covers only the Eastern species, and G. H. French's very 
excellent little book (published in 1886) has the same range. Dr. 
W. J. Holland's " Butterfly Book " covers the field, but it is 
adapted only for beginners, being essentially a picture-book with 
lamentably meagre text. In nomenclature the greatest possible 
difference exists between Scudder and Edwards. Scudder ap 
plied the rule of priority to generic names rigidly and fully and 
made many genera. Edwards disregarded the law, using any 
generic name that happened to be current, and made few genera. 
In the future a middle course between these courses will probably 
be adopted. More genera than Edwards recognized will be used, 
less than Scudder recognized ; while the law of priority will 
have to be followed. 

After Scudder and Edwards there remain but few special stu 
dents of North American butterflies. Dr. Henry Skinner has a 
good collection, and he has published a paper on the genus 
Ccenonympha, which, if followed by others, would give a mono 
graphic treatment of our butterflies which is much needed. But 
Dr. Skinner has not evinced a disposition to follow up this work 
with vigor, and he has not studied the larvae, a prime requisite 
for a specialist in the group. Mr. Wm. Beutenmuller has given 
a good paper on the old genus Ant ho char is, though he is not 
specially a student of the butterflies. 

In the Sphingidae almost nothing has been done in the period 
we are considering. Mr. Beutenmiiller has published the life 
histories of some species, but his descriptions are altogether too 
brief. Dr. Packard has given us a few life histories and pointed 
out the good field awaiting the student who would study our 
larvae on the lines laid down by Weismann and Poulton ; but no 
one has seriously attempted this. 

In the Saturnians scarcely more has been done than in the 
Sphingidae. Mr. Neumoegen and the writer " revised" the 



170 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

group, Grote has published a work in Germany which refers to 
American species, and Packard has published on the larvae, giv 
ing details of their peculiar structure and armature. He is still 
at work on the Saturnians, as a continuation of his monumental 
work on the " Bombycine Moths," of which the Notodontidae 
formed the first part, so that the next few years will probably see 
a great advance in this group. The title of Dr. Packard's work 
reminds us that we wish it were founded on a better system of 
classification. Packard's own system is open to criticism, viewed 
either from a venational, pupal, larval, or oval standpoint, and 
we regret to have such an excellent and comprehensive work 
proceed on a somewhat uncritical foundation. 

Sir George Hampson, of England, in his studies on moths, and 
especially in the " Lepidoptera Phalasnse," the series of mono- 
graphs of the world fauna being published by the British Museum, 
incidentally treats of American species. We think his work the 
best of its kind that we have studied. It suffers a little from haste, 
more especially in his earlier papers, and from the use of charac 
ters which are subject to variation, especially the smaller differ 
ences in venation. In using his book to determine Syntomidae 
we have been occasionally misled, even so far as to make syn 
onyms, owing to these defects. 

The last ten years of American entomology have been nearly 
uninfluenced by the personality of Mr. A. R. Grote. Since he 
took up his residence abroad he has been unable to contribute 
much to our subject. Formerly the leading student of North 
American Noctuidae he has lately turned his attention to more 
general studies. How much we have lost in the expatriation of 
this able man, with his clear and concise statements and his almost 
intuitive perception of specific characters, it is hard to say. His 
place has been taken by Dr. John B. Smith, a patient, careful 
man, who has given lengthy descriptions of numerous new species, 
usually accompanied by synoptic tables and a revision of the 
group to which they belong. We are fortunate to have this work 
done in so capable a manner. Yet two tendencies in the work 
may be criticised. The descriptions are often vague from the very 
effort at completeness, and this vagueness is increased by the too 
discursive character of the introductory remarks accompanying 
the revisions of groups. The synoptic tables seem somewhat 



OF WASHINGTON. 171 

overdone. I would not say that the characters used are some 
times imaginary, yet they verge upon this definition. Certainly 
it is at times difficult for the general student to appreciate them 
when he has the specimens before him. As written they always 
seem to present good contrasts. Dr. Smith has not cultivated a 
knowledge of larval forms, and his work is not checked by breed 
ing. This renders his idea of a species the more likely to become 
mechanical and lead him to describe as species forms not entitled 
to that rank. 

The Notodontidas have been ably monographed and the result 
beautifully published, at Government expense, by Dr. A. S. 
Packard, a world-renowned zoologist. Dr. Packard has treated 
his subject in the broadest possible manner, making great gen 
eralizations and deducing philosophical arguments from his study 
of these moths. The work is in general commendable, though 
we have ventured to pick some small faults. We cannot but 
regard it as a pity that Dr. Packard should waste his philosophi 
cal arguments in trying to prove the transmission of acquired 
characters and the direct effect of the environment on structure. 
This seems to us so much lost labor. For practical use his 
monograph suffers from the weakness of the synoptic tables, as 
we have had occasion to remark (Can. Ent., xxviii, 189, 1896). 
Somehow Dr. Packard seems never to become personally ac 
quainted with the species of which he treats, if I may use such a 
term. This may be due to lack of time or to too equal reliance 
on information furnished by persons of varying responsibility ; 
but, whatever the cause, it leads him to be able to commit such 
errors as describing the same larva as that of two different moths 
and never detecting the incongruity. 

Dr. Packard's early studies on Geometridae hardly come within 
the' range of our present view. His successor has been Dr. Geo. 
D. Hulst. Dr. Hulst has published many new species and 
genera, and has revised the family with full generic tables. His 
work, undoubtedly brilliant in certain respects, is seriously marred 
by his habitual carelessness. Nothing that Hulst has done can 
be absolutely relied upon, for fear that a thing, apparently most 
evident, may be found to be vitiated by some blunder that he 
knew much better than to commit. It is a pity that his types are 
not with some student able and willing to go over and verify his 



172 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

work. Once verified, it would become thoroughly valuable. 
Dr. Hulst favored the use of secondary sexual characters, and he 
not only employed them in generic definition, but used them as 
prime characters in his synoptic tables. This is an inconveni 
ence in practice, for a species cannot be named unless both sexes 
are at hand in the material for determination, which is often not 
the case. However, this did not prevent Dr. Hulst from found 
ing new genera on a female specimen only. He simply supplied 
the missing male characters from his fertile imagination (e. g. 
genus Pterotcea^ Trans. Am. Ent. Soc., xxiii, 349, 1896). Yet 
in spite of defects, Dr. Hulst is badly missed, for he leaves no 
successor in the study of the Geometridse. 

In regard to the higher Tineids, the Pyralids have received 
very little attention. We have had no student devoting himself 
to them as a specialty. Fortunately Dr. C. H. Fernald is now 
engaged in this study, though his work is as yet unpublished. 
Dr. Hulst published sundry new species in the Phycitinae. His 
article on this group was published in 1890, and hardly comes 
within our view. It has been followed by the first part of Ra- 
gonot's great work, published in the RomanofF Memoirs, which 
includes the Phycitinae of the world. We have not studied the 
subject enough to be able to criticise this book. The Crambinae and 
Pterophoridae have been acceptably treated by Dr. Fernald in small 
separate publications. We do not like the use of a series of 
alternatives based on shades of color, as in the separation of the 
species of the genus Pterophorus. But in general the work 
serves admirably for the purposes of determination. The Tor- 
tricidaa have remained practically untouched for ten years, only 
certain new species having been described. In the Tineids, 
Lord Walsingham's work on the North American species has 
gradually ceased. His work is so excellent that it may well 
serve as a model to our future workers, both in its careful accu 
racy and its conservatism. With its cessation there seemed at 
first no successor, but lately three men have taken up the sub 
ject, Dr. W. G. Dietz, Mr. W. D. Kearfott and Mr. August 
Busck. Their work is as yet too small in quantity for much 
criticism, but seems to have been begun rightly. We fear that 
Dr. Dietz has a tendency to make species on too small charac 
ters, judging by his Pigritia paper. Mr. Kearfott, too, has 



OF WASHINGTON. 173 

shown something of the same tendency in his first paper. The next 
few years will certainly show marked advances in our knowledge 
of the Tineids. 

This review indicates that we need certain work in the im 
mediate future. A monograph of the Butterflies with practicable 
sypnotic tables, critically revising both genera and species ; com 
prehensive work on the larvae of the Sphingidas ; studies on the 
larvae of the Noctuidse^to supplement Dr. Smith's work on the 
adults, which should be continued ; a review of Dr. Hulst's 
work on the Geometridae, which might most profitably take the 
form of a monograph, giving practicable sypnotic tables to spe 
cies to supplement Dr. Hulst's generic ones ; determinative 
tables for Tortricidse, both generic and specific. Dr. Fernald 
ought not to delay the preparation of such a badly needed paper ; 
continued descriptions of new species of Tineids to make the 
extent of our fauna known to us. We hope to see these subjects 
soon taken up. , 



At the conclusion the society offered Dr. Dyar a vote of thanks 
for his address. The address was discussed by Messrs. Schwarz, 
Banks, Gill and Marlatt. 



Mr. Banks then presented the following paper : 

NOTES ON BRACHYNEMURI OF THE B. FEROX GROUP. 

(PLATE III.) 
By NATHAN BANKS. 

In examining some recent additions to my collection of Myr- 
meleonidae, I was struck more forcibly than ever before with the 
constancy in size and shape of the male appendages. Various 
species are now known to me from a considerable number of locali 
ties, yet there is no distinct variation in the general appearance 
of these appendages. Therefore it seems that they are of con 
siderable importance in the separation of species. In the B. ferox 
group I have had various specimens that differed from the known 
forms very slightly in colorational points but prominently in the 
appendages ; therefore I believe these forms are distinct species. 



174 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

; 

Two are from the United States, a third is from Baja California, 
and was formerly considered JB. peregrinus, but is very distinct 
from that species. The following table will separate these allied 
forms : 

1. Superior appendages very long and slender, more than one-half the 

length of last abdominal segment 2 

Superior appendages much shorter, scarcely as long or shorter than 
one-half the last abdominal segment 4 

2. Superior appendages as long as last abdominal segment, yellowish, 

apical abdominal segments without pale marks B. carrizonus. 

Superior appendages shorter than the segment, often blackish 3 

3. Superior appendages plainly shorter than last abdominal segment; api 

cal abdominal segments without pale marks B. assimilis. 

Superior appendages nearly as long as segment, black, abdomen spotted 
with pale throughout B. dtsstmtlis. 

4. Cubitus heavily marked with black ; pronotal stripes connected in front ; 

femora black above; superior appendages black B. ferox. 

Cubitus not heavily marked with black; thoracic stripes not connected 
in front; smaller species 5 

5. Femora thickly dotted with black; superior appendages blackish; ver 

tex not with four dots B. texanus. 

Femora wholly pale ; superior appendages yellowish ; vertex with four 
black dots B. 4-punctatns. 

Brachynemurus assimilis, n. sp. 

Face yellow, a transverse black spot from eye to eye, including bases 
of antennae, and limited above by a curved black band, the lower margin 
pointed in the middle; vertex pale, with a brown band, interrupted in the 
middle and not reaching the eyes. Prothorax yellowish, with four black 
stripes at subequal distances apart and all reaching anterior margin, the 
pair each side sometimes connected in front; lower margin with black 
stripe. Palpi tipped with black; antennae brown, quite long. Rest of 
thorax lineate and maculate with black, two stripes on meso- and metascu- 
tellum. Legs pale, more or less heavily spotted with black, the tips of the 
tibiae and tarsi black. Abdomen pale at base, lineate with black, beyond 
middle black. Wings hyaline, venation interrupted black and white; 
pterostigma pale, with a basal brown spot; the cubitus quite heavily 
marked with brown (but not so much as in B. ferox}. The abdomen of 
the male is very long, longer than in allied species, the superior appen 
dages very long and slender, about as long as in B. carrizonus, but the 
last abdominal segment is very much longer than the appendages. 

Length rj 1 , 57 mm. ; 9 > 34 mm. 

Four specimens from Tehama, California, August (Morse), 
and from Oregon. Closely allied to B. carrizonus, but differs 



OF WASHINGTON. 175 

by the greater length of the male abdomen, and also by the shape 
of the inter-antennal mark, which is not plainly transversely 
divided above antennae, and is pointed on the median line below. 

Brachynemurus carrizonus Hagen. 

All my specimens (15) have the appendages as Hagen describes 
them, about as long as the last abdominal segment. The inter- 
antennal mark is transversely divided above the antenna?, and the 
lower margin is not pointed on median line. 

Brachynemurus ferox Walker. 

JB '. peregrinus Hagen. 

I have compared the descriptions of Walker and Hagen with 
specimens from California, Oregon, Washington, Nevada, and 
Arizona, and think there cannot be the slightest doubt of the 
synonymy. 

Brachynemurus dissimilis, n. sp. 

Face pale yellow, a transverse black spot from eye to eye extending more 
below antennal bases than in B. assimilis or B. carrizoriia;, above cut off 
by a pale band from the curved black band on front margin of vertex; lat 
ter with a dot and line each side; palpi tipped with black; antennae long, 
brown; prothorax with four black stripes and side margins black, not con 
nected in front; rest of thorax marked with black, two stripes on meso- 
and metascutellum. Legs pale, lightly dotted with black, and the tibise 
and tarsi black-tipped; legs more slender than in allied forms. Abdomen 
pale at base, lineate with black, beyond middle black, but with a distinct 
yellow spot on posterior margin of each segment on each side in both 
sexes. Wings marked as in allied forms, the cubital marks not very heavy. 
Abdomen long and slender, the last segment, however, not as long as in 
B. asstmtlts, the superior appendages long and slender, black, and curved 
toward each other, plainly a little shorter than last abdominal segment. 

Length, r^, 39 mm. ; 9 > 2 5 mm. 

Habitat, San Jose del Cabo, Baja California. This is the 
species that I had previously considered B. peregrimis in my 
paper on the Neuroptera of Baja California. 

Brachynemurus texanus, n. sp. 

Face yellowish, a transverse inter-antennal mark, concave on lower 
margin, separated by a yellow band from the black band on front margin 
of vertex; the latter with a triangular mark each side; palpi tipped with 
black; antennae pale brown. Prothorax with four black lines, somewhat 
broken in male; rest of thorax maculate with brown, two stripes on meso- 
and metascutellum; legs heavily dotted with black, tibiae and tarsi tipped 
with same. Wings marked as in allied species. Abdomen pale at base, 
lineate with black, black beyond middle, but with pale spots on the pos-

terior margin of some of the segments. Last abdominal segment of male 
quite long; the superior appendages short, divaricate, black, not half the 
length of the segment. 

Length, ^, 33 mm. ; 9 , 25 mm. 

One pair from Laredo, Texas, August (McClendon). 

Brachynemurus 4-punctatus Currie. 

This species is very constant in markings, as Mr. Currie has 
already noted ; however, I think it is closely allied to the other 
species by the structure and general plan of markings.

The paper was discussed briefly by Mr. Currie. He men 
tioned the fact that many species which differ widely in other 
respects often have very similar anal appendages and, vice versa, 
there are some species which resemble each other very closely 
except as regards the appendages. He said that, according to 
his own observations, there is considerable individual variation, 
in some species, both in the length and shape of the inter-antennal 
marking. Mr. Banks replied that, though there is some varia 
tion in length, he has found the shape fairly constant in the 
species he has studied. The paper was further discussed by 
Messrs. Schwarz and Gill.

Mr. Ashmead was elected Vice-President of the Washington 
Academy of Sciences for the Entomological Society. 

Mr. Ashmead exhibited both sexes of two species of wasps 
from Chile, from the collection of Mr. E. C. Reed. The first 
was labeled Agenia xanthopus Spinola. Both male and female 
possess very short wings. This species is a synonym of Poiu- 
pi'tusg-ravesiiHaliday and will fall into the genus Sphictostethus 
of Kohl. The other species shown was Cosila chilensis Spinola, 
the type of Mr. Ashmead's family Cosilidag. Mr. Ashmead 
pointed out that the genus Cosila could not belong to the Scoliidse 
on account of important differences in venation, and because the 
hypopygium of the male is unarmed. 

Dr. Dyar exhibited specimens of a new genus and species of 
Geometridae, and presented descriptions as follows:

Dr. Dyar showed also Volume VII, Number i, of "The 
Insect World," the entomological magazine published in Japa 
nese by Y. Nawa, which contains a colored plate of a moth and 
larva parasitic upon FulgoridaB. He said that this was of special 
interest in connection with the species found by Messrs. Schwarz 
and Barber in New Mexico, and which has recently been described 
before this Society as Epipyrops barberiana. Mr. Nawa's moth 



OF WASHINGTON. 181 

is obviously an Epipyrops, though no specific name seems to be 
mentioned. Mr. Nawa might appropriately name it, as it is 
probably undescribed. The plate is discussed in three pages of 
Japanese with explanation of the figures on page 4, and there is 
a two-page account in English by Mr. U. Nawa at the end of the 
magazine. The question of the food of the Epipyrops larvae 
seems to be still not clear. Prof. Westwood conjectured that it 
was the white secretion of the Fulgorids, but Mr. Nawa's account 
does not seem to support this view. The latter states that the 
larvae secrete a white covering and that they even cause the host 
to be visible at a distance by this when there are several of them 
on one host. Dr. Dyar thought it did not seem reasonable that 
larvae should secrete a substance similar to their own food. 
Besides, there is but very little of this pruinose matter on the 
Cicada-like host, certainly not enough to support several larvae, 
it would seem. Mr. Heidemann had shown him specimens of 
the, host. Might not the Epipyrops larvae be true parasites after 
all? 

Mr. Simpson exhibited a micro-photograph of sections of 
the eversible gland of the larva of the lo Moth (Automeris io 
Fabricius). He stated that, in exceptional specimens, this gland 
was missing. 

The introduction to the following paper, presented by Mr. 
Busck, was then read by Dr. Dyar, in the absence of the author : 

NOTES ON BRACKENRIDGE CLEMENS' TYPES OF TINEINA.* 
By AUGUST BUSCK. 

Although a few stray species of American Tineina were de 
scribed before 1859, that year really marks the beginning of the 
study of these insects in this country. During that and the fol 
lowing four years the late Dr. Brackenridge Clemens, a practising 
physician of Easton, Pa., published a series of systematic and 
biological articles, which yet remain the most important contribu 
tion to our knowledge of American Tineina. These papers con 
tain descriptions of 31 new genera and of about 200 new specie^ 
together with notes on larval habits of many of them. 

* The following new names are proposed in this article : Lithocolletis 
hamameliella, new species (p. 189); Brackenrtdgia, new genus (p. 193); 
Greya, new genus (p. 194). There are also original descriptions of the 
following larvae: Stilbosis tesquella Clemens (p. 202); Cryptolechia obs9- 
letella Zeller (p. 206). 



182 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

Types of all these species were deposited by Dr. Clemens in 
the collection of the Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadel 
phia. There they were studied in 1872 by Lord Walsingham, 
and some years later, according to information obtained through 
Miss Mary Murtfeldt, by Mr. V. T. Chambers, who, however, 
did not seem to have more appreciation of these types than he 
had of his own, and he only went over them in the hastiest man 
ner. Finally they were studied in iSSi by Prof. C. H. Fernald. 
There is also evidence that Dr. C. V. Riley was acquainted with 
at least a part of them. 

Prof. Fernald has kindly given me his recollections about 
Clemens' types in iSSi. They were then just as received from 
Clemens, pinned with the short English brass pins on small pieces 
of cork glued to the glass in old-fashioned insect boxes, each cork 
bearing a number corresponding to a list in Clemens' handwrit 
ing. 

On account of the unsafe condition of the glass boxes these 
types were later transferred by Mr. E. T. Cresson and Dr. Henry 
Skinner to a large double box, and each specimen was labeled 
with the number found on the cork. A statement to this effect is 
found in Cresson's handwriting on part of Clemens' list, yet in 
existence. 

Since then the types of this pioneer worker in this group of 
insects have remained in oblivion, partly because no one took an 
active interest in the study of Tineina and partly because the speci 
mens, to the uninitiated, did not give the impression of much 
importance, bearing no labels to indicate their true value, while 
the box to which they had been transferred contained a number 
of other moths of no importance and was stored away and subse 
quently overlooked and forgotten. 

During a visit of the writer to the Academy in the spring of 
1900, this box was not in evidence in spite of careful search and 
repeated inquiries. All that was found was a part of Clemens' 
list of his types, with Cresson's note about the disposition of 
them. One box, it is true, was there, which contained some 
specimens undoubtedly pinned by Clemens, but careful study soon 
revealed that only a small part of the insects were truly Clemens' 
own specimens, and that even those could not with any reason 
able certainty be regarded as his original types. At most they 
only represented an insignificant proportion of his species. 
* Thus the collection of the types left by the founder of the study 
of American Tineina was given up as lost, and Clemens' descrip 
tion alone had to be relied upon for the identification of his 
species. The great majority of them have been identified with 
certainty from that source alone a fact which speaks highly of 
the carefulness of Clemens' work. Still quite a number remained 
unknown to the present active workers, and some of them there 
was little hope of ever identifying with certainty. 



OF WASHINGTON. 183 

Great, therefore, was the writer's delight when, on a short 
visit to the Academy last fall, he opened an old-fashioned double 
box, which had turned up in the interval between his visits, and 
found one side filled with what, he at once realized, was the 
nearly complete set of Clemens' original types. 

Pinned as they were on the short English pins, many of them 
touched the cork with their wings and several were consequently 
more or less damaged ; but considering their old age and their 
precarious method of preservation in a box which was neither 
dust nor insect proof, it is rather remarkable that they had not all 
been destroyed. However, all were in recognizable and useful 
condition, and some of them in a perfect state of preservation. 

On this visit the writer was unable, from lack of time, to do 
more than merely satisfy himself of the genuineness of this col 
lection of types ; but shortly afterwards he had the opportunity, 
through the liberality of the U. S. Department of Agriculture, 
and on the invitation of the Academy in Philadelphia, to spend 
two weeks in the study and resurrection of this important collec 
tion, which he regards it a privilege to have been able to restore 
to the dignity due the founder of this branch of science in this 
country. 

That these specimens truly are Clemens' authentic types is 
proven by Cresson's statement and by the list in Clemens' own 
hand, corresponding to the numbers on the specimens. It is 
further verified by several instances, where Clemens, in his de 
scription, mentions accidental peculiarities of the specimens before 
him, which are found to be present in the corresponding type. 

The numbers on the first 124 specimens correspond, with a 
few easily explained exceptions, with the chronological order of 
Clemens' descriptions, and these were found in the same order in 
Clemens' handwritten list. The numbers on the rest of the types 
were seemingly without order and many intervals occur. On 
the whole, however, these also were found to correspond rela 
tively to the chronological order, and the intervals can be ac 
counted for by intervening types of other groups, though several 
unexplainable deviations occur. By careful verification of each 
species through the description it was not difficult for one some 
what familiar with the different forms to apply each type to its 
proper name, taking as starting points species already well known 
and working forwards or backwards according to the numbers. 

The studies resulted in the identification of the types of all but 
eight of Clemens' 200 species. Five of these eight have been 
identified with certainty from Clemens' descriptions, leaving only 
three species unknown at present. 

The types are now properly mounted on small corks pinned 
with stout pins in four Schmitt boxes. They can now be taken 
out and examined without unnecessary risk to the specimens, and

The following are detailed statements of the number and con 
ditions of these types, together with such notes on their syste 
matic position and synonomy as are possible without mono 
graphic studies of all the families. When such studies are under 
taken additional changes will probably be found necessary. 

A serious drawback to the value of Clemens' descriptions was 
his failure to give the size of his specitnenor the locality. In the 
following notes the writer has given alar expanse of all the species 
according to the measure of the type specimen, as well as the 
locality of all those species of which he has seen other material. 

For several reasons it is found most convenient to treat the 
species chronologically in the order in which they are found in 
Stainton's edition of Clemens' North American Tineina. 

Tinea biflavimaculella Clemens. 

One perfect type, Clemens' No. i ; alar exp., 16.5 mm. 

Stainton, who received two specimens of this species from 
Clemens, wrote in a foot-note in Clemens' Tineina of North 
America : " It appears to be almost identical with the European 
Tinea rusticella, var. spilotella Tengstrom," and Zeller* made 
it a synonym of this species. Lord Walsingham corrected thisf 
and I have no hesitation, after comparing a good series of bifla- 
vimaculella with authentic European specimens of rusticella, 
in agreeing with him that Clemens' species is quite distinct. 
Walsingham established in the same paper the synonymy with 
Walker's Tinea insignella.\ 

Biflavimaculella belongs to the genus Monopis, Hu'bner. A 
specimen compared with Clemens' type is in the U. S. National 
Mueum. 

Tinea dorsistrigella Clemens. 

Two perfect types, Clemens' No. 2 ; alar exp., 14.5 mm. 

This is, as Stainton suggested (Tin. N. Am., p. 50, 1872), a good 
species, near, but quite distinct from, the European ferriiginella 
Hu'bner. Walsingham has established its synonymy with Tinea 
subjunctella Walker. Clemens' types are larger than average 
specimens of this common species, of which a good series is 
found in the U. S. National Museum. 

The writer has bred this species from larvse feeding in a bird's 
nest. It belongs in the, genus Monopis Hu'bner. 

Tinea crocicapitella Clemens. 

One perfect type, Clemens' No. 3 ; alar exp., 14 mm. 

Lord Walsingham made this species a synonym of the European 
ferruginella Hu'bner, and it has been retained as such in Riley's 

*Verh. k. k. zool.-bot. Gesell. Wien., xxiii, p. 220, 1873.

list and subsequently. This is an error ; ferruginella is inter 
mediate between the two American species, dorsistrigella 
Clemens and the present species, and it is quite as near the for 
mer as the latter. Crocicapitella is very distinct and shows no 
variation towards the European form, differing in the lighter and 
dulfer, more brownish ground color, in the darker head and 
thorax, and especially in the absence of white scaling on the 
costal edge above the transparent discal spot. It also lacks the 
small, sharp, light costal streaks found towards the apex in 
fe r r ugin ell a . 

Tinea carnariella Clemens. 

One type, the wings on left side absent ; otherwise in good con 
dition. Clemens' No. 4; alar exp., 18 mm. 

From the description of this species, or probably more from 
the habits of the larva, Stainton surmised that it might be the 
cosmopolitan Tinea pellionella Linn.* But several discrepan 
cies in the description intimated that he was wrong in this assump 
tion, and Clemens' type now proves that it is quite a different 
species. It is a true Tinea. No other specimen exactly like the 
type is at present known to the writer. 

The condition of this specimen lacking the wings on one 
side is characteristic of many of Clemens' types and is explained 
by the note in his letter of June 23, 1860, to Stainton, published 
by the latter in his edition of Clemens' papers (p. 36) : " I cannot 
promise, however, to send specimens of all the Tineina I have 
described, for frequently the descriptions have been drawn from 
a single specimen, which has been deprived of one pair of wings " 
[evidently for the purpose of structural studies]. 

Tinea lanariella Clemens. 

One type in good condition, Clemens' No. 5 ; alar exp., 14 mm. 
As determined by Stainton, who received four specimens of this 
species from Clemens, it is the same as the cosmopolitan Tineola 
biselliella Hummel, and must be known under that name. Com 
pared specimens are in the U. S. National Museum. 

Tinea nubilipennella Clemens. 

One type, somewhat rubbed but easily recognizable, Clemens' 
No. 6 ; alar exp., 15 mm. 

As determined by Stainton, this species is identical with the 
European Tinea fuscipunctella Haworth. I have examined 
the types of CRcophorafrigidella Packard, from Labrador, now 
in the Museum of Comparative Zoology in Cambridge, Mass., 
and concur with Lord Walsingham's opinion that they represent 

*Tin. N. Am., p. 51, 1872. 



186 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

the same species.* A large series compared with Clemens' type 
is in the U. S. National Museum. 

The writer has bred this species repeatedly from the nests of 
tame pigeons at Washington, D. C. 

Tinea variatella Clemens. 

One type in poor condition, with head and left fore wing miss 
ing. Clemens' No. 7; alar exp., 12.5 mm. 

Probably the same as the European Tinea granella Linn, as 
suggested by Stainton. 

Xylesthia pruniramiella Clemens. 

Two types, with head missing in both ; otherwise in good 
condition. Clemens' No. 8; alar exp., 12 and 14.5 mm. I 
have examined Chambers' type of Xylesthia clem ens ell a-\ in 
the Museum of Comparative Zoology in Cambridge, and 
Zeller's specimen of Xylesthia congeminatella,\ and I am con 
vinced that these species are identical and the same as Clemens' 
species. I have collected a large series around Washington, and 
in Kentucky and Missouri. The differences which Zeller and 
Chambers found in comparison with Clemens' description are 
simply due to the different state of preservation of their speci 
mens. The delicately loose-scaled fore wings of this species are 
exceedingly easily injured by handling and then present quite a 
changed appearance. 

Compared specimens are in U. S. National Museum. 

Amydria effrenatella Clemens. 

One type, the abdomen missing, otherwise perfect. Clemens' 
No. 9; alar exp., 27 mm. 

This type agrees with our preconceived conception of the spe 
cies derived from Clemens' description. Compared specimens 
are in U. S. National Museum from the Atlantic Coast region. 
Stainton, who had a specimen of this species from Clemens, sug 
gested that the genus was the same as Euplocamus, Latreille ; 
but, as pointed out by Clemens himself, it differs in possessing 
well developed maxillary palpi. 

Anaphora plumifrontella Clemens. 

One somewhat rubbed type, Clemens' No. 10; alar exp., 33 
mm. 

This type verifies the present conception of the species, as de 
fined by Walsingham, with bombycina Zeller as synonym. It be 
longs to the genus Acrolophus Poey. A large series, collected

Clemens' type, is in the U. S. National Museum. 

Anaphora popeanella Clemens. 

Two types, both rubbed, one unspread and without abdomen ; 
the other spread, and lacking the head and left wings. Clemens' 
No. ii ; alar exp., 28 mm. 

Like the present conception of Anaphora popeanella^ as de 
termined by Walsingham and synonymous with scardinaZe\\er, 
and with agrotipennella Grote. A specimen compared with the 
type is in the U. S. National Museum. 
" Habitat: Eastern United States. 

Anaphora arcanella Clemens. 

One type, without abdomen but otherwise in good condition, 
Clemens' No. 12 ; alar exp., 29 mm. 

This species was transferred to the new genus Pseudoanaphora 
by Lord Walsingham. A specimen compared with the type is 
in the U. S. National Museum. 

Habitat : Eastern United States. 

Lithocolletis lucidicostella Clemens. 

Two types, one perfect, the other without abdomen and hind 
wings. Clemens' No. 13, alar exp.. 7.5 mm. 

Specimens bred from the underside of leaf of sugar maple and 
agreeing with the type are in the U. S. National Museum. 

In Riley's List this species is by mistake printed ludicostella. 

Lithocolletis robiniella Clemens. 

One type, right fore wing missing, Clemens' No. 14 ; alar 
exp., 6 mm. 

This type is not in very good condition, but is easily recognized 
as the well known Robinia feeder, common in the eastern States, 
and synonymous with the earlier described Argyromiges psuedo- 
acaciella Fitch, but supplanting this preoccupied name. 

The similar species which Clemens bred from Amphicarpcza 
monoica and which he believed to be robiniella is Lithocolletis 
morrisella Fitch. 

Lithocolletis desmodiella Clemens. 

Three types, Clemens' No. 15 ; alar exp., 4.5 mm. 

These types represent our common smallest species of Litho 
colletis, which is the same as that subsequently described by Miss 
Murtfeldt as gregariella, as shown by Lord Walsingham. 

Habitat: Eastern United States. 

Lithocolletis seriferella Clemens. 

One perfect type, Clemens' No. 16 ; alar exp., 7.5 mm.

pared with Clemens' type are in the U. S. National Museum.

Lithocolletis basistrigella Clemens. 

One type in good condition, Clemens' No. 17; alar exp., 
8 mm. 

Bred specimens of this well marked species, compared with 
the type, are in the U. S. National Museum. The larva makes 
a mine on the underside of oak leaves. The species is synony 
mous with the later described Lithocolletis intermedia Freyand 
Boll. 

Lithocolletis argentifimbriella Clemens. 

One perfect type, Clemens' No. 18 ; alar exp., 7.5 mm. 

Bred specimens, compared with the type of this well known 
species, are in U. S. National Museum. Lord Walsingham has 
shown the synonymy with Chambers' Lithocolletis fuscocostella. 

Lithocolletis obscuricostella Clemens. 

One type, with right fore wing missing, otherwise in good 
condition. Clemens' No. 19 ; alar exp., 6 mm. 

Clemens rightly gave weight (by italicising) to the peculiar colo 
ration of the abdomen; but his description, " Black, tipped 
freely with yellow," is unfortunate. He meant that the base of 
the abdomen is black and the larger posterior portion is yellow. 
The underside is silvery. I have seen no specimen exactly like 
this type, but the species should be easiiy rediscovered through 
knowledge of the food-plant Ostrya virginica. 

Chambers has himself* established the synonymy with his 
L ith o collet is virgin iella . 

Lithocolletis ostryaefoliella Clemens. 

One type, with left fore wing missing and the other fore wing 
somewhat crippled, is still recognizable and agrees with the 
description. Clemens' No. 20; alar exp., 6 mm. I have no 
specimen exactly like this type. The species is exceedingly near 
to the foregoing species, which was bred from the same food- 
plant, but the minute differences in the wing markings and the 
color of the abdomen, pointed out by Clemens, are well substan 
tiated by the types. 

Chambers suggested and Walsingham confirmed the synonymy 
with Lithocolletis mirifica Frey and Boll. 

Lithocolletis lucetiella Clemens. 

One perfect type, Clemens' No. 21 ; alar exp., 7 mm.

has established the synonymy with Lithocolletis cenigmatella 
Frey and Boll.

Lithocolletis obstrictella Clemens. 

One type, right fore wing and abdomen missing. Clemens' 
No. 22 ; alar exp., 7.5 mm. 

I have no specimen like this type, which was bred, according 
to Clemens, from the underside of leaves of oak. The know 
ledge of the mine ought to insure its rediscovery. 

Lithocolletis caryaefoliella Clemens. 

Two types, one perfect, the other consisting only of head and 
left fore wing. Clemens' No. 23 ; alar exp., 6.5 mm. 

Bred specimens compared with the type are in the U. S. Na 
tional Museum. The generally accepted synonymy, suggested 
by Clemens himself, with Lithocolletis juglandiella Clemens, is 
probably correct. This latter species was named from the larva 
and mine only. 

Lithocolletis aceriella Clemens. 

One type, almost totally destroyed, only the head left on the 
pin, Clemens' No. 24. 

In the U. S. National Museum are specimens bred from upper 
surface mines on maple which agree with Clemens' description 
and with what is left of his type. They undoubtedly represent 
this species. Alar exp., 6.5 mm. 

Clemens states that the larva is found also in the leaf of Hama- 
melis virginica, but I am inclined to believe that he was mis 
taken and that the exceedingly similar but slightly larger species, 
which I have repeatedly bred from witch hazel, is a distinct spe 
cies. It differs from aceriella in the more reddish tuft, in the 
somewhat darker ground color and in the dorsal silvery streak 
above the cilia, which is more oblique, nearly parallel with the 
edge, while in aceriella it is more erect. Further, the two silvery 
fasciae are, in the Hamamelis feeder, absolutely parallel, while 
they are slightly diverging in aceriella. The Hamamelis feeder 
may be known as Lithocolletis hamameliella. 

Alar exp., 7 mm. 

Type. No. 6772, U. S. National Museum. 

Lithocolletis guttifinitella Clemens. 

One type, right fore wing missing, otherwise in perfect condi 
tion, Clemens' No. 25 ; alar exp., 7 mm. 

Clemens describes the antennae as blackish brown, omitting the 
silvery annulations, which are shown on type. Otherwise, it is 
a good description of the type, which represents the one extreme 
variety of our common u poison ivy" Lithocolletis, which has 
the two transverse fasciae nearly straight and diverging, the outer 
one being nearly perpendicular on the edge of the wing, while 
the inner one is oblique, nearer base on the dorsal side. 

The other extreme of this variable species is described by Frey 
and Boll as Lithocolletis toxicodendi.* This has the two fasciae 



* Stett. ent. Zeit., xxxix, p. 273, 1878. 



190 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

parallel, both being oblique, with dorsal ends nearer the base of 
the wing than the costal. These fasciae are besides in this variety 
slightly angulated outwardly at their upper third, especially the 
one nearest the base of the wing. I have bred unlimited numbers 
of this species from poison ivy around Washington, D. C., and 
have every intermediate form between the two extremes, and 
there is no doubt that the two names stand for the same species. 
Clemens' name will hold. 

Chambers made his Lithocolletis cesculisella* a synonym of 
guttifinitella, but Lord Walsingham doubted this, considering it 
exceedingly improbable. The name should be retained as a sepa 
rate species. 

Lithocolletis crataegella Clemens. 

One type, unspread, but perfect, Clemens' No. 26, ; alar exp., 
6.5 mm. 

This type proves Lord Walsingham's assertionf that Clemens' 
species is the same as the common European apple-feeder, Litho 
colletis pomifoliella Zeller, now known under the name Litho 
colletis blancardella Fabricius. Lord Walsingham placed Lith 
ocolletis deceptusella Chambers as a synonym of this species.J 

Lithocolletis hamadryadella Clemens. 

One perfect type, Clemens' No. 27; alar exp., 6.5 mm. A 
pin with the number 2J-F has evidently borne his variation F, 
but the specimen is destroyed. 

This type represents our well known, most common Litho 
colletis on oak, described later by Zeller as alternatella.^ A 
bred series compared with Clemens' type is in the U. S. National 
Museum.

complanoides Frey and Boll, and with latipennella Chambers.

Tisheria citrinipennella Clemens. 

One type, right hind wing and abdomen missing, otherwise 
in good condition ; Clemens' No. 31 ; alar exp., 8 mm. 

Lord Walsingham:}: has declared this species the same as the 
other oak-feeding Tisheria subsequently described by Clemens 
{quercitella}. lam unnble to concur in this view. While the 
present species may be the same as Tisheria quercivorella Cham 
bers, as determined by Walsingham. Clemens' Tisheria querci- 
tella is undoubtedly tinctoriclla Chambers, and will have to 
supplant that name. It is the only oak-feeding Tisheria which 
makes the circular silk-lined nidus for pupation, as described by 
Clemens and Chambers. The color of this nidus varies accord 
ing to the species of oak, and is on white oak, as Clemens de 
scribes it, whiter than the rest of the mine, and it is not always 
dark-veined as described by Chambers, and as is usually the 
rule. 

Clemens' types of the two species, though both are in poor 
condition, substantiate fully this view.f Series of both species 
from Washington, D. C., and from W T est Virginia, bred by the 
author, are in U. S. National Museum.

Coleophora coruscipennella Clemens. 

One perfect type, Clemens' No. 34, alar exp., 12 mm. 

Zeller made this common American species a synonym of the 
European Coleophora fabriciella Villers, which is now known 
under the name spissicornis Haworth, and it certainly would be 
exceedingly diffcult to distinguish between them. Still, as long 
as the life history and early stages of the American species is 
unknown, there is a possibility that it may be distinct, and I 
should have favored retaining it as such. A large series, collected 
at light around Washington, D. C., and compared with Clemens' 
type, is in the U. S. National Museum. 

Coleophora laticornella Clemens. 

One good type, Clemens' No. 35 ; alar exp., n mm. 

This proves to be the elm-feeding Coleophora, which has been 
of some economic importance of late years through its occurrence 
in large numbers in the parks of Brooklyn, N. Y. I have bred 
a large series of this species and am unable to distinguish it from 
authentic specimens (adults and cases) of the European Coleo 
phora limosipennella Duponchel, which feeds on elm in Europe. 

Our present knowledge of the genus Coleophora in this 
country is in such a hopeless state that I cannot indicate other 
synonyms of this species, though they doubtless exist among the 
67 described species. Our names have been given mostly 
without knowledge of the food plants and without any com 
parisons with previously described species. The present species 
will probably be found among them under another name. 
This, however, will not interfere with the much older European 
name. 

A bred series, compared with Clemens' type, is in the U. S.

OF WASHINGTON. 193 

Lord Walsingham examined this type in 1872, and from his 
recollection and notes on it, concluded that his Lampronia 
tripunctella was a synonym. He has also made Eudarcia 
simulatricella Clemens synonymous with Tinea ccemitariella 
Chambers. I have examined types of both these latter species 
and they are undoubtedly congeneric, but just as surely specifi 
cally distinct. The former is evidently Walsingham's Lam 
pronia tripunctella , agreeing in all particulars with his descrip 
tion and figure. The latter agrees well with Clemens' decription 
of russatella, but could not be Walsingham's species, lacking as 
it does the white apical cilia found in tripunctella and also in 
Clemens' type of simulatricella^ though not mentioned by 
Clemens. t\ russatella should then be known as Eudarcia 
russatella Clemens 

A specimen collected by the writer in Kentucky, and Cham 
bers' type of ccemitariella [No. 412] are in the U. S. National 
Museum. 

Incurvaria (Ornix) acerifoliella Fitch. 

The specimen of this species received by Clemens from Fitch 
is found under Clemens' No. 40. The right wings are missing ; 
alar exp., 1 1.5 mm. 

This agrees with our present conception of the species, speci 
mens of which are in the U. S. National Museum. Lord Wal 
singham has shown the synonymy of Tinea iridella Chambers 
with this species. The species falls, according to the venation, 
intermediate between the genera Incurvaria and Eudarcia, 
though it cannot rightfully be placed in either genus, as already 
shown by Clemens. 

I propose the name Brackenridgia, for the genus of which 
acerifoliella is type and which has the following very distinct 
venation : 

Fore wings n veins, vein 4 absent, all separate, 7 to costa, \b furcate at 
base. Hind wings as broad as fore wings, 8 veins, veins 5 and 6 stalked, 
rest separate, vein 6 to apex. The oral characters are as in Incurvaria. 

No other species is at present known to the writer. 

It is in this connection well to draw attention to the fact that 
probably only two out of the ten American species hitherto placed 
in Incurvaria truly belong in this genus, namely Incurvaria. 
cenescens Walsingham and Incurvaria politella Walsingham. 
Besides these, labradoriella Clemens* may profitably be left in 
the genus for the present until more material is obtained, though 
the appearance of the incomplete type, Clemens' No. 215,* does 
not suggest that genus as Clemens also noted. 

The same is the case with mediostriatella Clemens,* which 

* See post, under this species. 



194 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

only differs from the genus in having veins 7 and S in the fore 
wings stalked. It is also true of oregonella Walsingham, of 
which only the single type in Lord Walsingham's possession is 
known, but which will probably be found not to belong to In- 
curvaria when additional material is at hand. 

Of the other species hitherto placed in Incurvaria, two have 
now been disposed of, namely, Eudarcia russatella and Brack- 
enridgia acerifoliella. The remaining three species form a' 
separate genus, which may appropriately be known as Greya in 
honor of Lord T. de Grey Walsingham, who has added so mate 
rially to our knowledge of American Tineina, and who has de 
scribed all the three species included in the genus, namely, humi- 
lis,* punctiferella, and solenobiella.^ Greya is at once distin 
guished from the nearly related Incurvana by the absence of 
vein 10 in the fore wings. 

It has the following venation : 

Fore wings n veins, vein 10 absent, all separate; hind wings as broad 
as fore wings, 8 veins, all separate. Other characters as in Incurvaria. 

Authentic representatives of all of the foregoing species except 
labradoriella are in the U. S. National Museum. 

Plutella vigilaciella Clemens. 

One type in good condition, Clemens' No. 41 ; alar exp.,

This is, as determined by Stainton,a synonym of the European 
Plutella porrectella Linna3us. Specimens compared with 
Clemens' type are in the U. S. National Museum. 

Plutella limbipennella Clemens. 

One type, Clemens' No. 42 ; alar exp., 13.5 mm. 

This is, as determined by Stainton, a synonym of the cosmo 
politan Plutella cruciferarum Zeller, now known as Plutella 
maculipennis Curtis. 

Plutella mollipedella Clemens. 

One type, Clemens' No. 43 ; alar exp., 14 mm. 

This is, as shown by Stainton, the female of the foregoing 
species. 

Gracilaria superbifrontella Clemens. 

One type in fine condition, but lacking the left wings, Clemens' 
No. 44 ; alar exp., 14 mm. 

In spite of Clemens' definite statement that his species feeds

alchimiella Scopoli. He also makes it synonymous with the 
American maple-feeding Gracilaria packardella Chambers, 
and with the American oak-feeding species of Frey. 

This is not the case ; szipcrbifrontella Clemens must be re 
tained as a good species attached to Hamamelis. So must pack 
ardella Chambers (= elegantella Frey, Stett. ent. Zeit., xxxiv, 
p. 202, 1873), attached to Acer, while the American oak-feeding 
species, determined by Frey as supcrbifrontella, may or may 
not be the same as the European alchimiella Scopoli. I have 
not sufficient bred material to settle this last point with cer 
tainty. All of these species are very close and somewhat vari 
able. Bred specimens, compared with Clemens' type, are in the 
U. S. National Museum. 

Gracilaria fulgidella Clemens. 

One type, lacking the right fore wing, Clemens' No. 45 ; alar 
exp., 7.5 mm. 

This is different from any other described American Graci 
laria, and I have no specimen like it. Clemens' description is 
very accurate, though it would seem more natural to regard the 
dark color as the ground color, marked with white, dark- 
margined fascia?. The species is nearest to Gracilaria asteri- 
cola Frey and Boll. 

Gracilaria venustella Clemens. 

One type, lacking abdomen and left wing, Clemens' No. 46; 
alar exp , 6.5 mm. 

There is anotherof Clemens' specimens, labeled 197, the same 
as this type, and also lacking the left wings. This is evidently 
the specimen from which Clemens redescribed the species.* 

This is, as determined by Chambers himself,f the same as 
Gracilaria eupatoriella Chambers. Specimens collected at 
light in Kentucky and at Washington, D. C., by the writer, and 
compared both with Chambers' type in the Cambridge Museum 
of Comparative Zoology and with Clemens' type, are in the U. S. 
National Museum. The species belongs in Walsingham's genus 
Dialectica,\ but may remain in Gracilaria Ha worth until the 
group is worked up. 

Gracilaria strigifmitella Clemens. 

One type, left fore wing missing. Clemens' No. 47 ; alar exp., 
8.5 mm. 

This is the same species described by Chambers as Gracilaria 
duodecemliniella and also the same as his Ornix quercifoliella.

The types of both these species are in the Cambridge Museum of 
Comparative Zoology, and agree with the present type, as the 
descriptions would indicate. In Professor C. H. Fernald's col 
lection are two specimens of this species bearing Lord Walsing- 
ham's blue labels 722 and 723, and determined in his note-book as 
Ornix quercifoliella Cham. = Gracilaria duodecemliniella 
Chambers ( ?) and with the note : ' The description is not satisfac 
tory ; it needs redescription, and evidently belongs in the genus 
Gracilaria. Closely allied to Coriscium brogniardellum Fa- 
bricius in color and markings, but having the palpi of a Graci 
laria" (Walsingham). 

One perfect specimen, bred by the writer from oak at Wash 
ington, D. C., and compared with all three types of this species, 
is in the U. S. National Museum, besides several collected speci 
mens. 

The species belongs in the genus Dialectica Walsingham, 
which is separated from Gracilaria Haworth mainly by the 
pectinated posterior tibire ; it may, however, like the foregoing 
species, remain in Gracilaria for the present. 

Gracilaria violacella Clemens. 

One type, Clemens' No. 48 ; alar exp., 9 mm. 

There is another specimen of this species, namely, the bred 
specimen described later by Clemens as desmodifoliella. This 
specimen has Clemens' No. 41 2. These specimens represent our 
well known Desmodium feeder. Bred specimens compared with 
the type are in the U. S. National Museum. 

The name violacella must be retained for this species. 

Argyresthia oreasella Clemens. 

Two types, one without the left wings, the other consisting 
only of the left wings ; both are now pinned together on the same 
cork ; Clemens' No. 49 ; alar exp., 10 mm. 

This is, as determined by Stainton, the same as the European 
Argyresthia andereggiella Duponchel. Specimens compared 
with Clemens' types are in the U. S. National Museum. 

Ornix trepidella Clemens. 

The type of this species, Clemens' No. 50, is lost. 

Ornix festinella Clemens. 

One type, badly rubbed, Clemens' No. 51 ; alar exp. ,7. 5 mm. 
I am at present unable to give any opinion on the distinctions 
between this species and the others described by Clemens, owing 
to the condition of the types and the lack of bred material.

This is a male of the well known species as determined by Dr. 
H. G. Dyar.* 
Bedellia staintoniella Clemens. 

One type, Clemens' No. 54; alar exp., 10 mm. 

This is, as determined by Stainton, and subsequently by 
Clemens himself, the cosmopolitan Bedellia somnulentellaZ,^^. 

Cosmiotes illectella Clemens. 

The type of this species, Clemens' No. 55, is lost. 

I have not recognized the species, which Riley by mistake 
called illicit ell a.} 

The genus Cosmiotes was afterwards recognized by Clemens 
as synonymous with Elachista Treitsche. 

Cosmiotes maculoscella Clemens. 

One type without left wings, Clemens' No. 56; alar exp.,

I have no specimen like this type, which is somewhat rubbed, 
although easily recognized from Clemens' description. 

Cosmiotes madarella Clemens. 

One type without the right wings, Clemens' No. 57 ; alar exp.,

in coloration the American species of the genus Antispila 
Hiibner. 

Cosmopteryx gemmiferella Clemens. 

One type, left wing missing, Clemens' No. 58 ; alar exp., 11.5

As shown by Stainton, Clemens had two species mixed, the 
present and the one subsequently described by Stainton as clem- 
ensella. The type in Philadelphia represents Clemens' own 
species. Specimens compared with the type are in the U. S.

In spite of the additional evidence of these types, there is still, 
as I have shown, \ some uncertainty about the identity of this

I have long been acquainted with this fine species, which I 
have determined correctly from Clemens' description. The laVva 
feeds on hog peanut (A?nphicarpcea monoicd}, near Washington, 
D. C., spinning the leaflets together. It is a prettily marked 
and very striking larva : 

Head light yellow; eye spots black; body yellowish white, with 
thoracic shield, anal plate, thoracic feet, and all tubercles, blackish brown. 
Length of full-grown larva, 8.5 mm. ; width of head 0.6 mm.

type of this striking species. Lord Walsinghamt has made

but this is not correct. I fail to see how a careful perusal of the 
two descriptions could allow the conclusion. In the U. S.

Parectopa lespedezaefoliella Clemens. 

One type, without wings on the right side, Clemens' No. 106 ; 
alar exp., 7 mm. 

Lord Walsingham has made* Clemens' Parectopa robiniella 
a synonym of this species as well as Gracilaria mirabilis 
Frey and Boll. My examination of Clemens' types of these two 
species does not tend to confirm this conclusion. In fact I think 
the differences pointed out in Clemens 1 description fully borne 
out by his types. However, not having any bred specimens of 
lespedezcefoliella^ I prefer to leave the synonymy as it is. The 
genus Parectopa may yet be adopted ; but in the meanwhile 
the species may be known as Gracilaria Icspcdezcefoliella 
Clemens. 
Bucculatrix pomifoliella Clemens.

Machimia tentoriferella Clemens. 

One type, lacking left wings, Clemens' No. 109 ; alar exp., 25 
mm. 

This is our well-known species, described later by Chambers 
as Depressaria fernaldella.\ Lord Walsingham has madej 
Depressaria confertella Walker a synonym of this species. 
During a visit at the home of Prof. C. H. Fernald, I saw two 
specimens in his collection, not of this species, which Prof. Fer 
nald had compared with Walker's tvpe in the British Museum 
and which he has identified as confertella Walker. They cer 
tainly agree better with Walker's description than does Machi 
mia tentoriferella Clemens. They agree well with Zeller's de 
scription of Cryptolechia ferruginosa, and I believe they are 
that species, in which case the name ferruginosa would fall for 
the older name confertella Walker. At present, however, before 
Walker's type has been re-examined to find which of the two 
gentlemen was right in his determination, it is proper to leave 
the synonymy as first determined. A large series, identical with 
Clemens' type of Machimia tentoriferella, is in the U. S. Na 
tional Museum.

Psilocorsis quercicella Clemens. 

X)ne type, Clemens' No. no; alar exp., 13 mm. 

I have bred a very large series, at different times, of what is 
indisputablv this species, from larvae on oak. These specimens 
agree with Clemens' description and also with his type. 

There is another very similar and equally common species, the 
larva of which also feeds on oak and occurs at the same time and 
same localities as quercicella. The imagoes of this species are 
exceedingly difficult to separate from quercicella. They are gen 
erally slightly larger (i to 2 mm. additional expanse) and have 
the short black transverse lines less pronounced than in this species. 
They have the apical edge of the fore wing generally more dis 
tinctly blackish than it is in quercicella. The larvae are quite 
different from the easily recognized larvae of quercicella , with 
which they are often found, even between the same two leaves. 
These larvae are white, with blackish brown head and slightly 
lighter brown thoracic shield, divided in the center by a straight 
longitudinal white line ; the second thoracic segment is somewhat 
reddish laterally ; the rest of the body is white, turning slightly 
rose-colored at maturity. In the larvae of quercicella the three 
thoracic segments are black. This species, I am inclined to be 
lieve, is Zeller's Cryptolcchia obsoletella* with the description 
of which it agrees well. 

Lord Walsingham made the following species synonymous 
with quercicella Clemens: (i) Depressaria, cryptolechiella 
Chambers, f the food plant of which according to Chambers is 
holly; (2) Hagno faginella Chambers, \ the larva of which 
feeds on beech : (3) Cryptolechia cressonella Chambers, which 
I believe with Chambers is the same as Zeller's erroneous con 
ception of quercicella; (4) Psilocorsis dubitatella Zeller.|| 
Finally Lord Walsingham identified^" a species bred from Am 
brosia as this same species. It is evident, as Lord Walsingham 
himself conceded,** that there is some mistake here. Zeller's 
conception of Psilocorsis quercicella Clemens, was clearly 
erroneous, as is shown by the measurement he gives of his speci 
men (length of fore wing 4'") , which would give an alar expanse 
of 19 mm. Psilocorsis quercicella varies only slightly in size, 
and the very largest specimen in a series of more than fifty has 
an expanse of only 15 mm., while the average size is a little 
more than 13 mm. 

Zeller, probably, had before him the very similar but larger

Psilocorsis reflexella Clemens. The same reason suffices to 
disprove the synonymy of fagineUa Chambers, which has an 
expanse of j-inch= 19 mm.* and of any of those species treated 
by Chambers under that name.f Moreover, Chambers described 
the larva of faginella, and his description could not apply to 
quercicella. The size also eliminates Zeller's Psilocorsis 
dubitclla, which, according to Zeller, has a wing length of 3-75. 
lines. Having not bred faginella nor cryptolechiella I am un 
able to pronounce on the synonymy of these species otherwise 
than that they are not the same as quercicella Clemens. I have 
bred, besides the two oak feeding species, two other extremely 
similar, but equally distinct, species of this group, one from 
Amelanchier and one from Carpinus, both with larvae different 
from the oak feeding species. I venture to suggest the propriety of 
leaving all the species separate for the present. 

Zeller at first included]: both Clemens' genera Psilocorsis and 
Machimia in his Cryptolechia, but afterwards recognized them as 
valid genera but included the type of Cryptolechia, the African 
straminella Zeller, || in Machimia. Lord Walsingham showed^f 
that straminella could not properly be included in Machimia, 
and placed it in Psilocorsis* dropping that genus as a synonym < 
of Cryptolechia. This, however, seems unwarranted, consider 
ing the different palpi of this genus. Psilocorsis must stand, in 
cluding the above-mentioned species and ferruginella Zeller 
(confer tella Walker ?). 

Psilocorsis reflexella Clemens. 

Two types, both unspread, one without the wing on the right 
side, Clemens' No. 112 ; alar exp., 22 mm. 

A specimen compared with the types is in the U. S. National 
Museum. According to the conclusions expressed under the 
foregoing species, Psilocorsis quercicella Zeller (nee Clemens) 
and cressonclla Chambers would be synonymous with the present 
species. 

Menesta tortriciformella Clemens. 

One type without abdomen and wings on the right side, Clem 
ens' No. 100; alar exp., 9.5 mm.

with Gelechia liturclla Walker,* and with Hyale coryliella 
Chambers. f 

The National Museum possesses a specimen which has been 
compared with Clemens' type. 

Nepticula rubifoliella Clemens. 

One type, lacking the right fore wing, Clemens' No. 113 ; alar 
exp., 4 mm. 

I have not bred this species and am at present unable to give 
an opinion on the synonymy with the European Nepticula an- 
gulifasciella, which Clemens suggested. 

Opostega albogaleriella Clemens. 

One type, Clemens' No. 120; alar exp., 5.7 mm. 

I have collected this species repeatedly at light in the District 
of Columbia. Clemens' description does not mention the apical 
costal and dorsal streaks, but they are present in his type, though 
very faint, because the specimen is rubbed. Nevertheless, Frey 
was fully justified in separating his Opostega accessoriella\ from 
Clemens' species, from which it differs by the dark dorsal spot ; 
but Frey evidently did not know of Chambers' Opostega quad- 
ristrigella. It is the same as Frey's species, as the description 
shows. 

Of the two remaining American species placed in Opostega, 
nonstrigella Chambers is the only one that truly belongs to this 
genus. It differs from Clemens' species by the dark dorsal patch, 
and from quadristrigella by the absence of apical markings. 
fiosquella Chambers is, as originally described by Chambers, || 
a Nepticula and is the same as that previously described by Zel- 
ler as Trifurcula obrutclla^ as the type of this species in the 
Cambridge Museum proves. 

Representatives of all these species, collected by the writer in 
the District of Columbia and in Kentucky, are in the U. S. National 
Museum. 

Trichotaphe alacella Clemens. 

One type, Clemens' No. 115 ; alar exp., 13.5 mm. 

This type confirms the present conception of this well known 
species. Specimens compared with it are in the U. S. National 
Museum. Gelechia ochripalpella Zeller,** a.\\d Gelechia good- 
elliella Chambers, f| are synonyms of this species.

Solenobia walshella Clemens. 

One type, of little value, both fore wings and right hind wing 
missing, the specimen glued on a triangle; Clemens' No. 121. 
The case of this species and pupa skin in good condition are 
found separate under Clemens' No. 122. 

Though the type is of little use for identification, there is no 
doubt about this well known species. The genus Solenobia* is 
now included in the Psychidae. 

Nepticula fuscotibiella Clemens. 

One type, right fore wing missing, Clemens' No. 123; alar 
exp., 4 mm. 

This is a true Nepticula, of which I have at present no other 
representative. 

Nepticula bifasciella Clemens. 

One type without right fore wing, Clemens' No. 124 ; alar exp., 
4.5 mm. 

I have no specimen of this species at present, but I have kept 
sketches and descriptions in my notebook, as well as of all others 
not represented in the U. S. National Museum. 

Nepticula platanella Clemens. 

One perfect type, Clemens' No. 118 ; alar exp., 7 mm. 

I have bred this common species repeatedly from the large, 
nearly circular, upper surface, blotch mines on sycamore, near 
Washington. Bred specimens compared with the type are in the 
U. S. National Museum. 

Lyonetia speculella Clemens. 

One type, without wings on left side, Clemens' No. 119 ; alar 
exp., 10 mm. 

This is clearly the same species subsequently described by 
Packard as Lithocolletis nidificansella* and this is, as suggested 
by Chambers, also synonymous with his Lyonetia gracilella; 
Lyoiietia apicistrigella Chambers, the type of which I have 
examined in the Cambridge Museum of Comparative Zoology, 
is another synonym. This reduces the six species recorded in 
Dyar's List of North American Lepidoptera, 1903, p. 563, to 
three, viz., Lyonetia speculella Clemens, Lyonetia alniella 
Chambers, t and Lyonetia latistrigella Walsingham.J

I had never seen an example of this striking species. It is well 
described by Clemens. The genus belongs among the narrow 
winged genera near Tinea. 
Hybroma servulella Clemens. 

One type, badly broken, Clemens' No. 116; alarexp., n mm. 

Specimens of this easily recognized species, compared with 
Clemens' type, are in the U. S. National Museum. 
Strobisia levipedella Clemens. 

One perfect type. Clemens' No. 182 ; alar exp., n mm. 

This confirms our present conception of the species, which, as 
determined by the writer,* belongs to the genus Anacampsis 
Curtis. 
Parectopa robiniella Clemens. 

Two good types, Clemens' No. 183 ; alar exp., 6.5 mm. 

See preceding note under Parectopa lespedezcefoliella Clemens. 
Brenthia inflatella Clemens. 

One type without the left wings, Clemens' No. 181 ; alar 
exp., 12 mm. 

This type agrees with the present conception of Choreutis 
inflatella as defined by Mr. W. D. Kearfott,t and is presumably 
only a variety of the more common form, subsequently described 
by Clemens as Brenthia virginiella. 
Coleophora leucochrysella Clemens. 

One type, without right fore wing, Clemens' No. 180; alar 
exp., 14.5 mm. 

I have seen no other specimen of this fine species. As an aid 
to identification it may be added to Clemens' description that the 
underside of the fore wings is dark fuscous, except the apical 
fifth part, which is pure white. 
Coleophora concolorella Clemens. 

One type, left fore wing missing, Clemens' No. 179 ; alar exp., 
10 mm. 

I have no specimen exactly like this small, unicolorous, incon 
spicuous species. 
Marmara salictella Clemens. 

Clemens' type No. 125 of this species is lost, but no difficulty 
is met with in identifying the insect from the careful description 
and from the knowledge of its remarkable life history, so well 
given by Clemens. The writer has bred it for several seasons 
and gave some notes before the Washington Entomological So 
ciety on its unique mode of ornamenting its cocoon, which 
deserves fuller treatment. Such will be given shortly in a sepa 
rate paper.

Glyphipteryx impigritella Clemens.

A specimen determined by Lord Walsingham and agreeing 
with Clemens' type is in the U. S. National Museum. Also 
specimens collected at light, Washington, D. C., by the writer. 
Chambers made* his Glyphipteryx cxoptatella a synonym of 
this species. 
Gelechia nigratomella Clemens. 

One type, Clemens' No. 187 ; alar exp., n mm. 

This type proves the present conception correct, and the species 
should be known as Aprocerema nigratomellct. Specimens com 
pared with Clemens' type are in the U. S. National Museum. 
Gelechia mediofuscella Clemens. 

One type, Clemens' No. iSS ; alar exp., 14 mm. 

This confirms the present conception of the species, and is a 
true Gelechia, the same as the subsequently described Gelechia 
vagella Walker, Depressaria fuscoochrella Chambers and Gele 
chia liturosella Zeller. Specimens compared with Clemens' 
type are in the U. S. National Museum. 
Gelechia fuscopunctella Clemens. 

One type without wings on the left side, Clemens' No. 185 ; 
alar exp., 13 mm. 

This is, as shown elsewhere by the writer, a Telphusa, very 
close to but different from Telphusa quercinigracella Chambers. 
A series, bred from oak in the District of Columbia, and com 
pared with Clemens' type, is in the U. S. National Museum. 
Gelechia gilvomaculella Clemens. 

One type without head or the wings of the left side, Clemens' 
No. 190; alar exp., 14.5 mm. 

This proves the species a true Gelechia and the same as the 
subsequently described Gelechia biminimac.ulella Chambers. 
Specimens compared with both Clemens' and Chambers' types 
are in the U. S. National Museum. 
Gelechia longifasciella Clemens. 

One type without head, otherwise in good condition, Clemens' 
No. 192 ; alar exp., 17 mm. 

This confirms the present conception of the species.t It is the 
same as Telphusa curvistrigella Chambers, and consequently 
type of that genus. Specimens compared with the types of both 
authors are in the U. S. National Museum, collected by Miss 
Mary Murtfeldt,'of Kirkwood, Mo.

Specimens, bred from tulip tree in the District of Columbia and 
compared with- Clemens' type, are in the U. S. National Museum. 
Tisheria quercitella Clemens. 

One type with wings not fully expanded, as described by 
Clemens; his No. 184; alar exp., 7 mm. 

This species has been treated already under Tisheria citri- 
pennella Clemens. It is not synonymous with that species, as 
hitherto considered, but with the subsequently described Tisheria 
tinctoriella Chambers. 
Gelechia angustipennella Clemens. 

One type, left wings missing, Clemens' No. 194; alar exp., 
13 mm. 

This proves to be the species described by the writer as Aristo- 
telia kearfottella,* which name consequently falls as a syn 
onym. The species should be known as Aristotelia angusti 
pennella. Specimens compared with Clemens' type are in the 
U. S. National Museum. 
Gelechia apicilinella Clemens. 

Clemens' type No. 195 is lost, and the species must remain, 
as placed by Riley, a synonym of Aprocerema nigratomella 
Clemens. 
Gelechia pullifimbriella Clemens. 

One type, Clemens' No. 191 ; alar exp., 12 mm. 

This proves the species to be a small, inconspicuous, nearly uni- 
colorous Gelechia, different from any with which I am ac 
quainted. I have no specimens exactly like the type which is 
well described by Clemens. 
Holcocera chalcofrontella Clemens. 

Two types, Clemens' Nos. 201 and 202, the latter marked 
44 light variety "; alar exp., 15 mm. 

Chambers suggested that his species Holcocera clemensella 
might be a variety of chalcofrontella, and he later reasserted this 
opinion. | In Cambridge, Mass., I examined Chambers' type, 
which is in very indifferent condition, but inasmuch as neither 
this type nor Chambers' description disagrees with undoubted 
specimens of chalcofrontella, it seems proper to regard the two 
names as synonyms. Specimens compared with the types of 
both authors are in the U. S. National Museum.

Holcocera purpurocomella Clemens. 

One type without wings on the right side, Clemens' No. 200 ; 
alar exp., 16 mm. 

This type proves the species to be the same as the subsequently 
described Blastobasis quiesquiella Zeller. Specimens compared 
with Clemens' type and previously found identical with Zeller's 
type in the Cambridge Museum, are in the U. S. National 
Museum. 

Holcocera gilbociliella Clemens. 

One perfect type, Clemens' No. 203 ; alar exp., 13.5 mm. 

Zeller rightfully separated his Blastobasis livorella from this 
species, which lacks the two dark dots at the end of the cell and 
which is quite distinct from any other described American species. 
A specimen compared with Clemens' type is in the U. S. National 
Museum. 
Holcocera modestella Clemens. 

One type without wings on left side, Clemens' No. 204 ; alar 
exp., 1 6 mm. 

This proves, as suspected by Zeller, to be the same as his 
Blastobasis nubiiella^ the type of which I have examined in the 
Cambridge Museum. It is also the same as Holcocera glan- 
dulella Riley, as suggested by Lord Walsingham.* A large 
bred series, compared with the types of both authors, is in the 
U. S. National Museum. 

While treating this group I may add that Blastobasis sciaphi- 
lella Zellerf is the same as Holcocera triangular isella Chambers,! 
as types of both species in Cambridge prove. Chambers' sug 
gestion that it is a variety of glandulella Riley (modestella 
Clemens) is not substantiated. All of the species here mentioned 
belong to Holcocera Clemens. 
Ypsolophus punctidiscellus Clemens.

This is, as I had anticipated from Clemens' description, the 
same species described by Zeller as Cryptolechia lithosina, and 
by Chambers as Harpalyce tortrice.Ua. Both of these names, 
as well as the generic name Ide, substituted by Chambers for the 
preoccupied Harpalyce, must be dropped for the earlier one of 
Clemens. The genus belongs to the family Xyloryctidcz Meyrick.

Homosetia tricingulatella Clemens. 

One type, wings on left side lacking, Clemens' No. 198 ; alar 
exp., 1 1 mm. 

This is the same species as described by Chambers subsequently 
as Pitys miscecristatella. Chambers called attention to the simi 
larity of both his genus and species to Clemens' form, but very 
excusably separated his genus, judging as he did only from Clem 
ens' description, which omits any mention of the characteristic 
tufts of raised scales, though they are found in the types. I am 
unable to find any justification for the genus Semele Chambers,* 
which Chambers later confessed! was probably not well separated 
from Pitys. I have examined the type of Semele cristatella 
Chambers, which is the type of the genus. It agrees in every 
respect generically with Pitys. Both of these genera fall before 
Clemens' earlier Homosetia. Specimens collected at Washing 
ton, D. C., and in Kentucky, are in the U. S. National Museum.

Chauliodus (?) canicinctella Clemens. 

One type consisting only of thorax and right fore wing, Clem 
ens' No. 214; alar exp., 10 mm. 

In spite of its poor condition, the type will ultimately enable 
identification, as the coloration of the fore wing is quite striking, 
and well described by Clemens. I have at present no specimen 
like it. and cannot give any definite opinion on its generic posi 
tion. If Clemens' generic description is correct, as is probably 
the case, the species cannot be included in Epermenia Hiibner 
( Chauliodus Treitsche). 

Ornix boreasella Clemens. 

One type, head, abdomen, and right wings missing, Clemens' 
No. 217 ; alar exp., 9 mm. 

I have no specimen like this. The species must be retained 
provisionally in the genus Ornix, though Clemens' description 
and what is left of his type, indicate that it cannot belong there.

Incurvaria labradorella Clemens. 

One type without wings on left side, Clemens' No. 215 ; alar 
exp., 7 mm. 

This species has already been treated. It may at present be 
retained in Incurvaria. It is a striking species, agreeing well 
with Clemens' description. No other specimen of the species is 
known to the writer. 
Gelechia brumella Clemens. 

One type, right fore wing missing, Clemens' No. 196; alar 
exp., 23 mm. 

I have no specimen like this, which proves the species to be a 
true Gelechia, near vernella Murtfeldt. It is, however, a much 
larger and darker species. I know of no other examples. 
Walshia amorphella Clemens. 

Two types, Clemens' No. 225 ; alar exp., 17 mm. 

A bred series of this species, compared with Clemens' type, is 
in the U. S. National Museum. I have examined the types in 
the Cambridge Museum of Laverna miscecolorella Chambers, 
which represent the same species, as shown by Lord Walsing- 
ham.* 
Gelechia (?) ornatifimbriella Clemens. 

One type, Clemens' No. 228 ; alar exp., 17 mm. 

This proves to be the same species described by Zeller as Gele 
chia unctella. A bred series, compared with the types of both 
authors, is in the U. S. National Museum. 
Gelechia gallaegenitella Clemens. 

One type, left wings missing, Clemens' No. 229; alar exp., 
10.5 mm. 

This type confirms my identification of the species. | It should 
be known as Epithectis gallcegenitella Clemens. Bred speci 
mens, compared with the type, are in the U. S. National Museum. 
The specimens subsequently described by Clemens as this species, 
bred from willow galls, presumably do not belong here, and 
Clemens' description should, therefore, be disregarded. These 
specimens are not found now with. Clemens' types. 
Gracilaria coroniella Clemens. 

One type, both fore wings and one hind wing missing, Clemens' 
No. 226. 

Lord Walsingham determined with some doubtj the common 
birch Gracilaria of the Eastern States as Gracilaria coroniella. 
Inasmuch as this agrees with Clemens' description and with what 
is left of his type, this determination is probably correct and 
should be accepted. Bred specimens from Washington, D. C., 
are in the U. S. National Museum.

Depressaria pulvipennella Clemens.

This confirms my present conception of the species. Speci 
mens compared with the type are in the U. S. National Museum. 

Depressaria cinereocostella Clemens. 

One type, Clemens' No. 173 ; alar exp., 17 mm. 

The writer's conception of this species is verified. A bred 
series, compared with type, is in the U. S. National Museum. 

Hamadryas bassettella Clemens. 

Two types, Clemens' No. 221 ; alar exp., 14 mm. 

A bred series of this striking but common species is in the 
U. S. National Museum. It is known now under the generic 
name Euclemensia Grote,* Hamadryas being preoccupied. 

Cycloplasis panicifoliella Clemens. 

Two types with cases, Clemens' No. 219; alar exp., 4.5 mm. 

Specimens bred by the writer at Washington, D. C., and com 
pared with Clemens' types of this remarkable little species, are 
in the U. S. National Museum. 

Elachista brachyelytrifoliella Clemens. 

One type, right wings and abdomen missing, Clemens' No. 
218 ; alar exp., 6 mm. 

I have no specimen of this species, and the type is in rather 
poor condition for identification ; still the recognition of the 
species is assured from the knowledge of its food plant, together 
with Clemens' description. 

Adela ridingsella Clemens. 

One type, Clemens' No. 171 ; alar exp., 15.5 mm. 

Specimens compared with the type are in the U. S. National 
Museum. Lord Walsingham has pointed out| the synonymy or 
Adela schlcegeri Zeller and Dicte coruscifasciella Chambers 
with this species. 

Coleophora rosaefoliella Clemens. 

One type with its case, Clemens' No. 216; alar exp., 12.5 mm. 
I have no specimen of this species. 

Coleophora rosacella Clemens. 

Three types, Clemens' Nos. 166, 168 and 170; also two cases 
numbered 167 and 169. No. 170 represents Clemens' variety : 
alar exp., 12 mm. 

Not having bred material of this species I am at present unable 
to give a final opinion about the supposed variety. It seems to 
be specifically distinct.

Dasycera newmanella Clemens. 

One type, Clemens' No. 172; alar exp., 17.5 mm. 

Specimens compared with the type of this well known species 
are in the U. S. National Museum. The genus Dasycera 
Haworth has been made synonymous with (Ecophora Latreille 
by European authors. The present species should be known 
under that generic name. 

The only other American species described as Dasycera, 
namely nonstrigella Chambers, belongs, as I have shown,* to 
the Gelechiid genus Trichotaphe Clemens. The other American 
species hitherto placed in CEcophora should be placed tempo 
rarily in JBorkhausenia Hiibner, following European micro- 
lepidopterists. Future study will surely cause these species to 
be distributed in more than one genus. I cannot understand how 
European specialists, such as Meyrick and Rebel, have left in 
one genus species so widely separated as pseudospretella Stain- 
ton and borkhausenii Zeller. The former has 12 veins in fore 
wings and veins 3 and 4 in hind wings stalked like the type of 
the genus similella Hiibner, while the latter has only n veins in 
fore wings (vein 8 absent) and veins 3 and 4 in hind wings 
separate. CEcophora boreasella Chambers is, as proven by the 
description and by Chambers' type in Cambridge, the same as 
borkhausenii Zeller. 
Wilsonia brevivittella Clemens. 

Two perfect types, Clemens' No. 175 ; alar exp., 12 mm. 

Bred specimens of this common species compared with the 
types are in the U. S. National Museum. The genus Wilsonia 
can hardly be retained, as it agrees in all essential characters 
with Mompha Hiibner, under which genus the species should be 
placed. Lord Walsingham maclef Laverna another ceseminella 
Chambers and Laverna another cevorella Chambers, synonyms 
of Clemens' species. 
Ypsolophus flavivittellus Clemens. 

No type is found of this species, but there is no doubt about 
its identity with Ypsolophusligulellus Hiibner, under which name 
it should be known. 

Anesychia sparsiciliella Clemens. 

Two types, Clemens' No. 165 ; alar exp., 18 and 20 mm. 

The synonomy with Cryptolechia contrariella Walker and 
with Cryptolechia atropicta Zeller, as pointed out by Lord 
Walsingham,| is evid^rrtly correct^ as well as the generic position 
assigned by him. The species should be known as CryptolecJiia 
contrariella Walker. Specimens, compared with Clemens' type, 
are in the U. S. National Museum.

Elachista (?) orichalcella Clemens. 

One type in poor condition and without wings on left side, 
Clemens' No. 421 ; alar exp., 6 mm. 

Not having any material of this species for structural study, I 
am unable to pronounce on Stainton's opinion that it is probably 
not an Elachista. The type has the general aspect of this genus, 
but is not in sufficiently good condition to furnish information on 
the generic characters. 
Brenthia virginiella Clemens. 

One specimen (type?) with Clemens' label, but without his 
usual number ; in poor condition, left wings missing and right 
wings rubbed ; alar exp., 10 mm. 

This is the same, as far as the condition allows determination, 
as the present conception of the species, namely, a variety of the 
previously described Brenthia injlatella Clemens.* 
Gracilaria blandella Clemens. 

The type of this species is lost. 

The walnut feeder, suggested by Chambers to be this species, 
and redescribed by himf with his provisional name juglandivor- 
ella, agrees well with Clemens' description, and his name should 
stand for the species. Bred specimens are in U. S. National Mu 
seum from Washington, D. C. 
Tinea tapetzella Linnaeus. 

The specimen identified by Clemens as this species, bearing his 
No. 126, is found in good condition and proves it to be the Euro 
pean species, which is now known under the generic name 
Trichophaga Ragonot. The species supposed to be a variety of 
it, Tinea occidentella Chambers, is a quite distinct Tinea, as 
Chambers' type in Cambridge proves. 
Coleophora cratipennella Clemens. 

One perfect specimen, thus labeled by Clemens but without any 
number, is found in the collection. It agrees with Clemens' de 
scription and undoubtedly represents the species, though it may 
not be the original type. Alar, exp., 14 mm. 

Specimens collected by the writer at Washington, D. C., and 
corhpared with Clemens' specimen are in the U. S. National 
Museum. Chambers' type of Coleophora gigantella is there also. 
It proves synonymous with cratipennella as the descriptions would 
indicate. 
Gelechia fungivorella Clemens. 

Four types, Clemens' Nos. 455, 456, 457, and 458 ; alar exp., 
1 2 m m . 

These agree with my conception of Aristotclia fungivorella 
and with my bred specimens, but are very distinct from the fol 
lowing species with which I had associated it.

Gelechia salicifungiella Clemens. 

One perfect type, Clemens' No. 459; alar exp., 12.5 mm. 

In the absence of any specimens, and following Clemens' own 
suggestion, which his description seemed to substantiate, I had 
made this species a variety of the foregoing, Afistotelia fungi- 
vorella Clemens. The type, however, shows this conclusion to 
be entirely wrong ; salicifungiella is a very distinct Aristotelia, 
easily recognized by its showy brick red ground color. A speci

One type without wings on right side, Clemens' No. 418 ; alar 
exp.. 9 mm. 

Though differing slightly in venation, as pointed out by Clem 
ens, this species may, provisionally at least, be retained in Incur 
varia. Tinea auristrigella Chambers and Lecithocera Jiagis- 
trigella Walsingham have been made synonyms of this species. 
The type of the latter is in the collection of the Philadelphia Acad 
emy and agrees with Clemens' type. Identical specimens are 
in the U. S. National Museum. 



Mr. Ashmead exhibited specimens representing nine new 
genera of Cynipoidea and commented upon their peculiarities. 
Descriptions of these genera are contained in the following

SOME NEW GENERA IN THE CYN1POIDEA. 

By WILLIAM H. ASHMEAD. 

Family FIGITID^. 

Subfamily 



Kiefferiella, n. n. (= Kiejferia Ashm., preoc. in Diptera). 

This genus comes next to Figites Latreille, but is quite dis 
tinct in having the head and thorax coarsely rugosely punctate, 
by the antennae being filiform, the joints cylindrical, the third 
shorter than the fourth, and by the abdomen being compressed, 
the second segment being as long as 3 and 4 united. 

Type: K. rugosa Ashm., taken in the Santa Cruz Mts., 
California. 

The genus is dedicated to Abbe J. J. Kieffer, Professor at 
Bitche, Deutsch-Lothringen, who has so ably monographed the 
European Cynipidae. 

Subfamily EUC OILING. 

Zamischus Ashmead. 

The type of this genus, Z. brasiliensis, was taken by Mr. 
Herbert H. Smith in Brazil, and is the most striking form yet 
discovered in this group, being unique and quite unlike any other 
known Eucoiline. The metathorax is produced posteriorly into 
a long neck, the length of the hind coxae, while the abdomen is 
attached to this by an abnormally long, slender and smooth 
petiole the length of the body ; the antennae and the venation of 
the front wings are also peculiar, the former being very long, 
gradually thickened towards apex, while the costal and marginal 
cells are confluent, the marginal cell being only partially formed, 
entirely open all along the front margin, much as in Onychia 
Haliday. It shows some affinity with the Liopterinae. 

Type: Z. brasiliensis Ashm. (Chapada, Brazil.) 

Tropideucoila Ashmead. 

This genus is allied to Disorygma Forster, but is easily separ 
ated by having 5 longitudinal carinae on the mesonotum, and by 
the scutellum being bidentate. The antennae are i3-jointed, 
filiform. 

Type: T. rufipes Ashm. (Chapada, Brazil.) 

Promiomera Ashmead. 

Allied to Miomera Forster but easily separated by the antennae, 
which, in the $, are n-jointed, filiform, tapering off at apex; in 
3% long, i3-jointed, the third joint very much shorter than the 
fourth . 

Type: P. filicornis Ashm. (Chapada, Brazil.) 



222 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

Odonteucoila Ashmead. 

This genus is easily recognized by the scutellum which ends in 
a tooth or spine, and by the antennas which are long, filiform, 
with the third joint much shorter than the fourth. 
Type: O. chapadce Ashm. (Chapada, Brazil.) 

Trissodontaspis Ashmead. 

The scutellum in this genus is unique in the group, the cup 
being modified into a carina which is gradually dilated posteriorly 
and ends in a tooth-like projection, while the scutellum proper 
has a tooth each side posteriorly, the scutellum thus appearing as 
if tridentate, when viewed from above. The antennas are un 
usually long, the joints being long and cylindrical, the third 
joint slightly curved ; the pronotum is elevated into a sharp ridge 
and deeply emarginate medially, while the mesonotum is longer 
than wide. 

Type: T. rufipes Ashm. (Chapada, Brazil.) 

Dieucoila Ashmead. 

This genus differs from all others by having the head and thorax 
finely, opaquely sculptured, by the scutellum, which has two 
large, oblong shallow foveaa at base, and by peculiarities of the 
antennae, which are long, the joints cylindrical, long, but grad 
ually thickened, the third joint a little shorter than the fourth. 

Type: D. subopaca Ashm. (Chapada, Brazil.) 

Zaeucoila Ashmead. 

This genus is easily known by its short, robust form, by the 
short closed marginal cell, which is hardly longer than wide, the 
second abscissa of the radius being rather strongly curved out 
wardly and by the short mesonotum which has a delicate carina 
down the center, the cup of the scutellum being large, almost 
round. 

Type: Z. unicarinata Ashm. (Rio de Janeiro.) 

Pseudeucoila Ashmead. 

This genus is proposed for a number of species placed at present 
in the genus Eucoila Dalla Torre and Kieffer. but not Westwood. 
The type of Eticoila Westwood is E. crassinervis Westw.,and 
Psilodora Forster^is a synonym of it. In Pseudoeucoila the 
wings are pubescent and the marginal cell is closed. 

Type: Eucoila (Cothonaspis} trichopsila Hartig. 



The paper was discussed by Drs. Gill and Howard. Speaking 
of gall-wasps, Mr. Ashmead stated that the so-called "potato 
gall " (Tribal/a batatorum Walsh), which was in reality a root- 
gall on Rubus or Rosa, was described and named by Walsh from 
specimens given him by a farmer who reported that they were 



OF WASHINGTON. 223 

taken on a potato. It really represents a subgenus of Rhodites 
with an open marginal cell. Abbe Kieffer has rechristened this 
subgenus Lytorhodites. 

Dr. Dyar presented the following paper :

only fading on the disk of the thorax. Abdomen gray brown with red 
dish anal tuft. Fore wings with the ordinary spots obsolete ; lines single, 
black, grayish edged, strongly dentate; veins lined in black outwardly; 
a faint pale subterminal line, nearly obsolete. Color of wing dark red

is broader ; but there is obviously no specific difference. 
3800. Alcis haydenata Pack. 
3824. Coenocharis interruptaria Grt. 
Chesiadodes bidisata, n. sp. 

Differs from Hulst's definition of the genus in having the front 
of head flat, but falls here in his synopsis, assuming that the 9 
(which I have not) has developed wings. 

Head and thorax light gray, black sprinkled. Fore wings trigonate, 
light gray, densely sprinkled with black so as to appear dark stone gray. 
T.-a. line distinct, heavy, black, nearly straight, preceded by a broad 
aggregation of the dark scales, an aggregation of scales to form a broad, 
clouded, discal spot; t. p. line heavy, black, bent out far beyond the dis- 
cal spot, curved inward in a low broad arc below the cell, even, not waved ; 
a slight aggregation of black scales subterminally ; a black terminal line 
broken at the veins. Hind wings whitish, sprinkled with gray, most so 
outwardly; a gray rounded discal spot and terminal blackish line. Be 
neath more whitish, the marks of fore wing very faintly reproduced, but 
those of the hind wing more distinct than above. Expanse, 30 mm.

Four examples, July i, 7, and 16. All are a Itttle smaller than 
Lord Walsingham's measurements, c? 26, ? 27-30 mm. ; the 
head is white, not fawn brown, and there is no pink suffusion. 
But the description applies so well otherwise that I cannot think 
them specifically distinct. 

Eucosma gilletteana, n. sp. 

Allied to bolanderana Wals., but the wings more elongate and 
the markings likewise more drawn out and less serpentine. Also 
near agassizii Robs., but the serpentine streak is obliquely 
separated from the basal lanceolate portion. 

Light brown, top of head, ends of patagia and center of thorax white. 
A lanceolate white streak at base of fore wing, not reaching middle; be 
yond it a serpentine bar not touching costa at basal third nor outer margin 
above anal angle, but almost doing so; a slightly oblique costa*! spot at 
outer third and an apical one slightly oblique in the reverse direction; a 
small, irregularly double spot on outer margin and fringe ; a streak along 
interior margin, nearly divided at basal third. Hind wings grayish, fringe 
lighter. Expanse, 16-24 mm -

Eucosma (?) edemoidana, n. sp. 

Resembles Lord Walsingham's figure of Semasia bucepha- 
loides, but it is smaller, the head and thorax marked in yellow 
and brown. 

Palpi ocherous brown; head light ocher, brown at the sides; thorax 
reddish brown, ocherous on the disk before. Fore wing gray, finely 
transversely lined in dark gray; a straight heavier line at basal third de 
fines the darker basal portion, of which the costa at base is ocherous 
brown; middle of wing lighter, still crossed by the fine, strigose, trans 
verse lines; beyond this the transverse lines are again heavier, edged by 
pale scales; terminal fourth of wing reddish and ocher, contrasting, nar 
rowed toward internal margin, bordered basallj' by pale gray scales and 
crossed by a line of the same color with a few blackish scales centrally. 
A dark terminal line; fringe ocherous, mixed with gray. Hind wing 
blackish, fringe pale, interlined with gray. Expanse, 19 mm.

5201. Thiodia obliterana Wals. 

Nine specimens, bred from larvae in the roots of Artemisia. 
The specimens vary in the amount of ocherous shading on the 
costal half of wings. In some this is quite pronounced, in others 
fainter, but never absent as in Lord Walsingham's figure. Ap-

parently they agree with the specimens mentioned as received by 
him after the description had been drawn up. In the hind wings 
vein 4 is absent. 

Thiodia stygiana, n. sp. 

A large species without costal fold in the J\, the outer margin 
very distinctly sinuate ; hind wings with veins 3 and 4 stalked. 
5 arising very near the base of the stalk. 

Fore wings sordid russet brown, in some specimens shading to light 
gray on the costal edge, irrorate with brown; markings obsolete. The 
brown tends to lie in strigse along the costa, and very faintly forms oblique 
lines on wing; it is darker and solid along internal margin. In the place 
of the ocelloid patch are scattering black scales or dots. Fringe pale, 
lustrous shining with a brown subbasal line. Hind wings and abdomen 
brown black, very dark, contrasted; anal tuft light brown; fringe as on 
fore wings. Expanse, 27-31 mm. 

One J from Williams, Arizona, and five other specimens from 
Colorado (Golden, May 29, June 9 and 19, Dyar and Caudell).

I should certainly have supposed this large and conspicuous 
species to have been described before, as it seems not rare in the 
eastern foothills of the Rocky Mountains, but I am unable to find 
a description applicable to it. It resembles Lord Walsingham's 
figures of Pcedlsca irroratana, perdricana andfutminanaibut 
the four males before me show no sign of the costal fold. 

I have a much paler specimen in which the gray occupies nearly 
all the wing and the black dots on ocelloid patch are distinct, from 
Easton, Washington (A. Koebele, through C. V. Riley), which 
suggests Zeller's figure of T. rcessleri, and my stygiana may 
prove to be a form of that species. 
5210. Proteopteryx emarginana Wals. 

One specimen like Lord Walsingham's figure 2. 
5222. Epinotia lagopana Wals. 

One fresh Q specimen, July 23. 
Epinotia favillana, n. sp. 

Male without costal fold, outer margin of fore wings not sin 
uate. Resembles somewhat Lord Walsingham's figure of 
Pcedisca carolinana, but with differently disposed markings. 

Fore wings white with a faint purplish tint, heavily marked with black 
ish brown. A broad, dark basal area with edge indented on costa, cell 
and subrnedian fold, mixed with white scales toward base; a broad 
median band from costa to internal margin, its edge nearly straight, with 
some black and leaden scales toward costa; costal edge with dark strigae ; 
terminal third of wing with white ground prevailing, the margin edged 
with brown black, broadest at apex; a large dark spot subterrninally be 
tween veins 5 and 7, continued as a slightly oblique band to inner margin

and partly overlaid with white scales so as to appear gray ; an obscure 
patch of leaden scales follows this spot in the apical dark band. Fringe 
dark. Hind wings gray. Expanse, 20 mm. 

Three specimens, June, " bred from flower stalk." The name 
of the plant was not determined as only the dead and dried flower 
stalks were observed. 

Epinotia (?) cornutana, n. sp. 

Resembles Enarmonia vitrana Wals. Head pale fuscous. Body and 
wings brownish black, the outer part of fore wings with metallic bluish 
scales. A thick, geminate, oblique white bar on middle of internal mar 
gin, joins a similar one on dorsal margin, forming at the junction a beak- 
like projection of the black dorsal space. Beyond, four pairs of short, 
geminate, white costal streaks, the basal pair more oblique and remote 
than the others. The ocelloid patch consists of four dumbbell-shaped 
black bars on a grayish white ground, edged with scattered metallic 
scales. A white dash in the margin below veins 3 and 7 cuts the narrow 
black marginal line; fringe brown, shining. Expanse, 17 mm.

One female in very bad condition seems probably referable 
here. 
5405. i. Tortrix semicirculana Fern. 

One specimen agreeing with Prof. Fernald's description. I 
have also five others taken at Las Vegas Hot Springs, New 
Mexico (Schwarz and Barber). It greatly resembles quercifoli- 
ana Fitch, but the more pronounced lines of the fore wings run 
in a reversed direction. 

Tortrix dorsalana, n. sp. 

Head and fore wings light straw color; an oblique band of fuscous 
brown from middle of costa to before anal angle, broken across the cell ; 
a small spot on outer third of costa obscurely continued to anal angle by 
a somewhat curved streak; a spot on inner third of dorsal margin, ex 
tending upward in a few small strigse. Markings all pulverulent or 
strigose, more or less reduced, especially on the costal portions so that in 
one specimen the only markings left are a large blotch before tornus and 
a small spot on the inner third of dorsal margin. Hind wings whitish, 
more or less tinged with gray. Expanse, 18-24 mm.

May 5 and June 6 (T. D. A. Cockerell) and Wilgus, Cochise 
Co., Arizona (Dr. Barnes). 

Phalonia unistrigana, n. sp. 

Wings elongate and rounded, palpi short. Ground color white, over- 
washed on the fore wings irregularly with faint ocherous, the white re 
maining in patches in and below cell, on internal margin and in a trans 
verse band at outer third of wing. A narrow, broken, oblique black- 
brown line, directed from middle of inner margin to outer third of costa, 
not reaching inner margin, broken centrally, the lower part forming a 
rounded bar, the upper part more diffuse; a series of diffuse, irregular, 
dark dots in apical portion, in some specimens confined to apical margin, 
in others spread as far as tornus and situated on white ground color. 
Hind wing dark gray, fringe paler except at anal angle. Expanse, 
18-22 mm.

Besides the species listed anove, there are eight other species 
of Pyralids, mostly Phycitinae, and all but one females. Their 
position can therefore not be determined and they will have to 
await mates before being described. One of them is very strik 
ingly marked. 

The paper was discussed by Messrs. Howard and Ashmead. 
Mr. Ashmead mentioned a new and curious Mutillid collected 
by Messrs. Schwarz and Barber in Arizona. He said that 
special efforts should be made to collect wingless females of 
Mutillidae in association with the males, as it was almost im 
possible to determine them when taken singly.

NOTES ON THE NOMENCLATURE OF BLATTID^E. 
By A. N. CAUDEI.L. 

During the past year two attempts have been made to deter 
mine the type species of the Linnaean gecus Blatta. In Ento 
mological News, Volume xiii, page 101, Mr. James A. G. Rehn 
applied the process of elimination to the problem, only non-exotic 
species being considered in accordance with Canon xxiii of the 



OF WASHINGTON. 

A. O. U. Code. He arrived at the conclusion that Blatta orien 
talis Linnaeus is the type of the genus. But unfortunately the 
author gives in his table of elimination the date of the removal of 
orientalis from the genus Blait>t as 1846, when in fact it was 
placed in the genus Steleopyga by Fischer in 1833,* and four 
vears previous to that date into the genus Kakerlac by Latreille.f 
The only other non-exotic species, lapponica, was removed from 
Blatta to Ectobius by Westwood in 1835. { Thus, of the non- 
exotic species, lapponica was last removed and is, therefore, the 
type of Blatta as determined by the method of elimination when 
properly applied to the non-exotic species only. 

Dr. Krauss, in his recent most valuable communication on the 
nomenclature of the Orthoptera, also applies the method of elim 
ination, but, unlike Rehn, considers all the species originally in 
cluded under the genus, both exotic and non-exotic. By this 
means he shows surinamensis to be the last removed, except 
nivea, which was simultaneously removed, both being included in 
Burmeister's genus Panchlora. Later, 1865,1 Brunner removed 
surinamensis to his new subgenus Lettcophcea. This, reasons 
Dr. Krauss, makes Leucophcea and Blatta synonymous, each 
having surinamensis as the type species. 

Both of the above attempts at fixing the type of this genus, no 
matter how well done or how satisfactory the results may be to 
the respective authors, are, in the writer's opinion, wholly unnec 
essary and fruitless. As a matter of fact the type of Blatta was 
clearly designated many years ago. In 1807^" Latreille included 
orientalis alone under the genus, and on this fact Dr. Krauss 
bases the statement that orientalis was described as typical at 
that date. But five years prior to that date** Latreille specified 
orientalis as the example (example here obviously used in the 
sense of type) of the genus Blatta. Then, in iSioft the same 
author definitely designates orientalis as the type of Blatta, here 
using the word type. Now this author, writing as he did at a 
time before any of the original species had been removed from 
the genus, certainly had the right to designate which of them 
should constitute the generic type. A valid, non-exotic species, 
and one originally placed in the genus, having been specifically 
designated as the type, should never be changed, even by the one 
so designating it. Otherwise there can obviously never be a sta-

ble nomenclature. Thus orientalis is the type of the genus 
Blatta. 

Mr. D. W. Coquillett has recently called my attention to the 
fact that the dipterous genus Phyllodrotnia of Zetterstedt was 
described in 1837,* and not, as recorded by Agassiz and Scudder, 
in 1842. The orthopterous genus Phyllodroinia, being thus pre 
occupied in the Diptera, must necessarily fall. Being a valid 
genus, of which Blaita germanica Linnaeus is the type and hav 
ing no synonyms, a new name is unavoidable. The generic name 
Blattella is here proposed for it. 



Dr. Gill said that he upheld the conclusions Mr. Caudell had 
drawn in his paper. 

Dr. Howard said that in his opinion there is a distinct ethical 
question involved in the proposal of new generic names to take 
the place of those preoccupied. While it is true that any one 
who makes the discovery of preoccupation has a right to propose 
a new name, and probably a moral right, he considers such action 
discourteous to the author if the author be still living and engaged 
in active work, and also discourteous to specialists in the group 
involved if the person making the change is not himself a spe 
cialist in the same group. As an example., he would not himself 
think of proposing a new name in the Lepidoptera unless he had 
previously notified the author of the name of the fact of preoccu 
pation, and had indicated to him the desirability that he should 
himself propose a new name. Failing that, he would not pro 
pose a new name unless he had notified some other well-known 
worker in Lepidoptera of the preoccupation and had suggested 
that he propose a new name. In other words, in his opinion it 
is bad form for a man who is not a specialist in a group to pro 
pose a generic name in that group. 

Mr. Ashmead agreed with Dr. Howard's views and spoke 
further in criticism of the extensive proposing of new specific 
names, as in Dalla Torre's Catalogue, in consequence of 
homonymy within the genus. He thought the uniting of so 
many genera not justified and that the new names would have to 
be rejected. 

Dr. Dyar thought that personal considerations should not 

* Isis, p. 31. 



OF WASHINGTON. 235 

enter into the question of scientific nomenclature. He thought 
that any one discovering a preoccupied name not only had a 
right to propose a new one, but it was his duty to do so, without 
waiting to see if he was trespassing on any one's preserves. He 
deprecated the practice of waiting for some one else to correct a 
homonym, for the chances were that this might not be done for a 
long time, and the error thus lost sight of and perpetuated. 
Provided the proposer of new names had enough knowledge of 
the group not to make matters worse by proposing a new name 
when there was an old synonym that could be resurrected, he 
thought such persons were conferring a favor on science and should 
not be discouraged by disparaging comment. In reply to Mr. 
Ashmead's remarks he pointed out that the changes in names in 
Dalla Torre's Catalogue were unavoidable and perfectly proper, 
after the several genera had been united, and that such a union 
of genera was well within the right of the cataloguer. 

Dr. Gill said that his views coincided with those of Dr. Dyar, 
and Mr. Pollard stated that in proposing new names in botany 
the personal element was eliminated. 



Mr. Busck has submitted the following paper for publication : 

DIMORPHISM IN THE CODLING MOTH. 

(Cydia simpsonii, n. var.) 

By AUGUST BUSCK. 

In his bulletin on the Codling moth,* Mr. C. B. Simpson men 
tions a moth " Found on the trunk of an apple tree that had all 
the appearance of a codling moth, except the color, which was 
buff and gold throughout, the bronze spot being much the same 
as in the codling moth. During the summer of 1901,4 well- 
preserved and 8 badly worn specimens, having the same color, 
were bred among the common codling moth from apple, and 2 
others were observed in the field. Mr. Hitt, of Weiser, Idaho, 
found 7 of these moths among 50 moths bred in 1896. Whether 
this is a variety of Carpocapsa pomonella or another species, 
has not yet been determined." [Simpson.] 

During last summer, Mr. Simpson bred 6 more of these light-

colored moths among 182 of the normal codling moth from apple, 
at Boise, Idaho. These specimens were submitted to the writer 
for determination, and I have carefully examined them structu 
rally in comparison with the common form of Cydia pomonella 
Linne. I do not think there can be any doubt about their being 
this species ; the oral parts, the venation, the secondary male sexual 
character of the hind wing and the external sexual organs of both 
sexes are identically as found in the common dark form of the 
codling moth. The general pattern of ornamentation is also the 
same, but the coloration is so strikingly different that the variety 
deserves a special name, the more so as no intermediate forms 
seem to occur. I propose that it be known as Cydia pomoneUa 
Linne, var. simpsonii. 

Instead of the dark fuscous color of the common form, the variety is 
light buff with slightly darker buff transverse striation. In the common 
form the fore wings are finely irrorated with white, each scale being slightly 
white tipped ; in simpsonii the scales are not white tipped. The terminal 
patch, which in the common form is dark coppery brown, nearly black, 
and with dark violaceous metallic streaks, is in stmfisonii light fawn brown 
with pure golden metallic streaks. The extreme apical edge before the 
cilia is in the common form black, in the variety reddish brown, and the 
cilia in simpsonii are light golden ochreous instead of the dark fuscous of 
the common form. The head, palpi, body, legs, and the tuft of hairs on 
the hind wings of the male are correspondingly light buff-colored in the 
variety instead of dark fuscous as in the common form. 

Besides Mr. Simpson's specimens, in which both sexes are 
equally represented, there is in the U.S. National Museum a 
single female labeled Cook, California, July 30, 1883.

The three following papers were read by title : 

NEUROPTEROID INSECTS FROM ARIZONA. 
By NATHAN BANKS. 

The following species of Neuropteroid insects were captured 
bv Messrs. E. A. Schwarz and H. S. Barber in Arizona in 1901. 
I have included some taken by Mr. E. J. Oslar during the season 
of 1902, by Mr. H. G. Hubbard in the year 1897, by Messrs. 
Hubbard and Schwarz in 1898, by Mr. R. E. Kunze in 1897 and 
1898, and a few by Cockerell and by Morse. The dragon-flies 
and ant-lion flies are not included. The total number is about 
40 species ; especially complete is the series of Chrysopidae and 
Hemerobiidae. The other groups are poorly represented. 

Most of the species from Williams show close affinity to the 
Colorado fauna, but there are distinct indications of relation to 
the fauna of Southern California. A number of species are known 
to occur in Mexico, and one of these was not previously known 
from the United States. Two species have not been determined 
specifically. 

The species most abundantly represented, and therefore proba 
bly the most common, are Callib&tis undata, Chrysopa calif or- 
Jiica, Eremochrysa punctinervis, Micromus variolosus, and 
Hemerobiusperparvus. These are typical southwestern species, 
none of them being known from the eastern States. 

Order ARCHIPTERA.

in middle of wing; elsewhere the wing is sprinkled with minute dark dots, 
none, however, very close to the margin ; hind wings unmarked, venation 
brown. Antenna? quite long and slender, front of head swollen. Wings 
moderately long; pterostigma rather large, rounded behind; the closed 
cell quadrangular, as wide at base as at the tip, nearly twice as long as

pale yellow. Fore wings uniformly dark brown; hind wings nearly hya 
line, except the brown costal streak; all venation brown, unmarked. In 
structure similar to H. occidentalis Fitch; the first sector of radius con 
nected to lower fork of the second sector, the first sector not being forked 
till near tip of wing. The costal area is quite broad at base. 

Length of body, 3.5 mm. ; expanse, 10 mm. 

One specimen from W r illiams, June 10.

Polycentropus, sp. 

Four specimens from Santa Rita Mountains, May and 
(Schwarz). 

It is probably a new species. 
Hydropsyche divisa, n. sp. 

Head black ; face with silvery hair ; vertex with erect black hair ; behind 
with white hair; antennae brown, ringed with white; thorax black, with 
appressed white hair in the middle ; abdomen brown ; legs pale yellowish, 
darker above at tips of tibiae, and the tarsi often marked with brown ; 
spurs yellow. Wings brown, marked with some small white patches; just 
before the pterostigma is a white band extending back to the median vein, 
broadest on the costa ; and from the arculus there extends forward a nar 
row curved white band, nearly touching the other one, so that the wing 
is nearly divided by a white band bej r ond the middle. Sometimes there 
are indications of another white band halfway from this one to the base. 
Beyond the band the wing is paler than before, with more pale hairs. 
The fringe around the tip is blackish at tips of veins and yellowish be 
tween. Hind wings are fumose, with blackish fringe and venation. 

Structure similar to other small species; the hind tibia; are sparsely 
fringed on the posterior side. 

Lenigth, 7 mm. 

Several specimens from Salt river, April 10 (Oslar). 
Type. In the author's collection. 

Family LIMNEPHILID^. 
Anabolina, n. gen. 

A Limnephilid; peculiar in that the female has but three spurs on the 
hind tibiae, while the male has four; a condition unknown so far in this 
family. Three spurs on middle tibine. Anterior wings rather slender, 
lightly rounded at tip; in hind wings the fourth apical cell is narrow at 
base, the fifth quite broad; the discal cell rather longer than apicals. In 
fore wing the discal cell is very long; the pterostigma is quite distinct, 
and the radial vein is bent close by. Ocelli moderately large; two trans 
verse warts on vertex; basal joint of antennae rather short; prothorax 
extremely short; anterior tarsi of male not elongated. 

Type: A. diver sa Banks. 

In the present condition of the classification of the Limnephili- 
daB this must be a separate genus ; but the spur formula is not a 
sure criterion and I hope it may soon be displaced by some better 
character, drawn perhaps from the chaetotaxy of the head and 
thorax. 

Anabolina diversa, n. sp. 

Face pale, with golden hair, and black bristles on the sides; vertex 
brownish, with some short white hairs, a few black bristles behind each

antenna and a wart on each side of vertex bearing a row of black 
bristles. Thorax with a broad white stripe in middle, dark brown on the 
sides ; pleurae yellowish ; abdomen brown above, paler beneath. Antennae 
pale yellowish brown ; legs rather paler, with manj- black spines; spurs 
yellowish. Wings hyaline, with gray hairs; venation pale, irregularly 
marked with brown, the cubitus and anal more heavily marked; ptero- 
stigma rather distinct. Hind wings gray hyaline, venation brownish, a 
brown dot in base of third apical cell; fringe, short and brown in both 
pairs.

THE GENERA OF THE DIPTEROUS FAMILY EMPIDID^, 
WITH NOTES AND NEW SPECIES. 

By D. W. CoQUlLLETT. 

The present paper is an attempt to settle the type species of 
each North American and European genus of Empididas, and to 
bring some kind of system out of the present confused condition 
into which the genera of this family have fallen. Our own fauna 
is so similar to that of Europe that our students cannot well afford 
to ignore the latter when working with specimens from this coun 
try. Of the generic names adopted in the synoptic table given in 
my Revision of the North American Empidas, comparatively few 
changes are necessary ; thus Hemcrodromia includes more than 
one genus, and this is also true of Tachydromia; Mantipeza 
gives way to Chelifera* a much older name ; Rhamphomyia 
gives place to the much earlier Macrostomus, as Sciodromia 
does to the earlier Helcodromia j Syneches is replaced by the 
much earlier Acromyia, as Cyrtoma is by the earlier Bicellaria. 

In regard to the earliest date of each genus, the rule has been 



246 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

adopted that the name dates from its earliest appearance in print 
if accompanied by a description or by the name of a described 
species ; on the other hand, when both the name of the genus and 
of the species listed under it are simply manuscript names, it is 
evident that as yet ihe genus can have no standing. 

HISTORICAL. 

In the following list all generic names are given in regular 
alphabetical order, valid genera in bold-faced type, synonyms in 
italics. 

Acromyia Latreille, Gen. Crust. Ins., iv, 305, 1809. (Syneches 
Walker, 1852; Pterospilus Rondani, 1856.) 

Type : Asilus muscarius Fabricius. 

Latreille placed Acromyia Bonelli (evidently a MS. name) as a synonym 
of Hybos Meigen, gave a brief description of the genus, and mentioned 
Acromyia asiliformis Bonelli, Stomoxys asiliformis Fabricius (Asilus 
muscarius Fabricius, according to Meigen,* repeated by SchinertX 

Anthalia Zetterstedt, Ins. Lappon., 538, 1838.

Type : Synam phot era bicolor Loew. 

Brachystoma Meigen, Syst. Besch., in, 12, 1822. 
Type : Syrphus vesiculosus Fabricius. 

Meigen described two species, B. longicornis, new species, and Syrphus 
vesiculosus Fabricius. Westwood* designated longicornis as the type, but 
referred to the figure of vesiculosus as a typical figure. Rondanif selected 
longicornis as the type of his new genus Trichopeza, and designated vesi- 
cnlosus as the type of Brachystoma. 

Chamadipsia Mik, Verb. k. k. Ges. Wien 1881,326, 1882. 
Type : Clinocera hastata Mik. 
Mik mentioned only one species, Clinocera hastata Mik.

150, 1823. (Mantipeza Rondani, 18^6; Polydromya Bigot, 

18570 

Type: Tachydromia prcecatorta Fallen. 

Macquart described one species as new, C. raptor, but on page 165 
he states that it is identical with Hemerodromia monostignm Meigen 
( Tachydromia prcecatoria Fallen, according to Schiner,J and Loew). 

Chelipoda Macquart, Recueil Trav. Soc. Sci. Agr. Arts Lille, 
148, 1823. (Lepidomya Bigot, 1857.) 
Type : Empis melanocephala Fabricius. 

Macquart described two species, 7\ichydromia mantispa Panzer (an 
erroneous identification, a$ the species is credited with a discal cell), and 
C. minor, new species, but on page 165 he states that the latter is identi 
cal with Hemerodromia mantispa Meigen (.---- Tachydromia mantispa 
Panzer = Empis melanocephala Fabricius, according to Meigen. || and 
Schinerf). 

Chersodromia Walker, List Dipt. Ins. Brit. Mus., iv, 1157, 
1849. 

Type : Tachypeza arenaria Haliday.

Mici<ophorus Jlavipilosus Coq., M. crocatus Coq., and M. 
ravidus Coq., all belong to Microphorus*&$> originally referred, 
while M. atratus Coq. belongs more properly to Anthalia. 

The genera Holoclera and Euthvneura do not occur in this 
country, so far as I am aware. Holoclera bilineata Melander 
belongs to Microphorus, while H. sycophantor Melander be 
longs to Anthalia. Euthyneura aperta Melander, E. stentor 
Melander, and E. atripes Melander, are all referable to Micro- 
phorus ; while E. nura Melander and E. bulbosa Melander 



264 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

belong to Anthalia. Euthyneura bucinator Melander was 
founded on a single specimen without antennae, and its generic 
position cannot be given. 

Sciodromia palliata Coquillett belongs to Microphorus. 

Empis conjuncta Coquillett has more affinity with typical 
species of Empis than with those of any other genus ; from 
Ragas it differs widely, especially in the strongly projecting 
axillary angle, in the venation, mouth parts, etc. 

Hilara viridis Coq. belongs to the subsequently erected genus 
Lamprempis, as suspected by Prof. T. D. A. Cockerell in a 
recent letter to the writer. 

Synamphotera bicolor Loew is given above as the type of the 
new genus Boreomyia. 

Our species originally described under the old genera Hemcro- 
dromia and Mantipeza may be listed as follows : 

Chelifera : albipes Walker, notala Loew, obsoleta Loew, palloris Co 
quillett and valida Loew. 

Hemerodromia : caplus Coquillett, defessa Williston, cmpiformt's Say, 
rogatoris Coquillett and superstttiosa Say. 

Neoplasta : mexicana Melander and scapttlarts Loew. 

Metachela : collusor Melander and defecta Loew. 

Hydrodromia stagnalis Haliday has been recorded from 
Greenland by Lundbeck.* 

I am unable at present to assign to their proper genera our 
species described under the old genera Hybos and Clinocera, 
owing to the insufficiency of the descriptions and the lack of 
specimens. 

Wheeler and Melanderf state that Hybos triplex Walker, 
H. purpureus Walker, H. duplex Walker, and H. subjectus 
Walker comprise only one species, and this is repeated by Mr. 
Melander.]: When preparing my Revision of the Empidae I 
constructed the following table, but omitted its publication. 
While the names assigned to the species may not be correct in 
every instance, owing to Walker's superficial descriptions, yet 
every conscientious student must admit that there are three valid 
species : 

1. Hind tarsi of male bearing a row of stout black spines on the outer side 

of the first joint, femora without tubercles, 

Euhybus subjectus Walk. 
Hind tarsi without black spines 2 

2. Hind femora of male bearing on the outer third of the under side 

several elongated tubercles, each tipped with a short spine, the 
greatly curved hind tibiae with a corresponding cavity, 

E. purpureus Walk. 
Hind legs without tubercles and cavities ... R. triplex Walk.

In my Revision of the Empidce, page 397, attention was called 
to the fact that Enoplempis cincrea Bigot belongs to the 
genus Empis, and that as the name Empls cinerea is preoccu 
pied, Bigot's insufficient description had better be cancelled. 
Mr. Melander. however,* takes the opposite course, anpl pro 
poses the name Empis bigoti for the above species, thus adding 
another synonym to our already long list, since what is almost 
certainly the same species was described by the writer in his 
Revision, under the name of Empis manca, new species. The 
giving of new names to very imperfectly described species will 
hardly commend itself to students except in case that a more 
perfect description is added from the type or other authentic 
specimen. 

Mr. Melander's statementf that my original description of 
Empis pellucida depends on that of E. virgata is erroneous, as 
any student can ascertain by turning to that description. J The 
latter is complete in itself, and contains no reference to the de 
scription of virgiita* or any other species. 

Platypalpus trivialis Loevv has wholly yellow femora and 
tibiae in both sexes ; the U. S. National Museum possesses a series 
of specimens of both sexes from each of the following localities: 
White Mountains, New Hampshire; Beverly, Massachusetts; 
Las Vegas Hot Springs, New Mexico, and Colorado. 

Tachydromia inusta Melander, T. corticalis Melander and 7. 
brachialis Melander belong to Tachypeza. On the other hand, 
Tachypeza pusilla Loew belongs to Tachydromia. Tachypeza 
cluvipes Loew, T. rapax Loew, T. rostrata Loew and T. 
ivinthemi Zetterstedt, all belong to Tachypeza, as originally 
referred. Tachypeza rapax Loew is evidently a synonym of 
Sicus fenestratus Say ; I know of no other species in this group 
which has the front coxae marked with black, as mentioned by 
Say, a character peculiar to the male, the female having the front 
coxae and femora unspotted, and closely resembling rostrata, 
from which it may easily be distinguished by the yellow hind 
tibiae with only their apices brown or black. 

Drapctis medetera Melander belongs to Elaphropeza, as is 
evident from the greatly elongated third antennal joint. Drapetis 
ftavida Williston belongs to Tachvdromia, as already stated in 
my paper on the Diptera of Porto Rico ; not only are the front 
femora considerably thickened, but those of the male bear several 
spinous bristles on the under side. 

Tachydromia nubifera Coquillett belongs to the recently 
erected genus Coloboneura.

Phoneutisca bimaculata Loew is evidently a synonym of 
Tachvdromia maculipennis Walker ; both were founded on speci 
mens from the far North, and no other known species in this 
group has the wings marked " with a large brown spot on the 
fore border at two-thirds of the length from the base," as described 
by Walker.

MYRMELEONID^E FROM ARIZONA. 
By ROLLA P. CURRIE. 

As first contemplated, this paper was to be simply a report 
upon the ant-lion flies collected in Arizona by Messrs. E. A. 
Schwarz and H. S. Barber during the summer of 1901. After 
wards the writer decided to enlarge its scope and, following the 
example of Mr. Nathan Banks in his recently published paper, 
"Neuropteroid Insects from Arizona,"* make it as complete a list 
as possible of the Arizona species. 

Up to the year 1897 b ut l^ 6 was known concerning the 
Myrmeleonidae of Arizona. Hagen's " Synopsis of the Neurop- 
tera of North America " contains no Arizona records in this 
group of insects, and there are but two in his " Stray Notes on 
Myrmeleonidae. "f Much of our present knowledge concerning 
the ant-lion flies of this Territory is due to the efforts of Dr. R. 

*Proc. Ent. Soc. Wash., v, No. 4, pp. 237-245 (author's extras published 
April 29, 1903). 

t These are : BracJiynemums carrizonus Hagen, Can. Ent., xx. No. 5, 
p. 94, May, iSSS, and B. sackent Hagen, loc, cit., p. 95. Both are from

E. Kunze, who, during the years 1896 to 1898, made quite ex 
tensive collections, principally at Phoenix and Prescott, though 
he also obtained specimens at Bowie, Camp Creek, Goldfield, 
Huachuca, Nogales, Tucson, vSenator and Wickenburg. His 
material is now contained in the collection of Mr. Charles C. 
Adams, in that of Mr. Nathan Banks, and in the U. S. National 
Museum. In 1897 Mr. H. G. Hubbard collected a few speci 
mens in the Chiricahua Mountains, and at Fort Grant, Tucson, 
San Simon, Willcox and Fort Yuma. In 1898 Mr. E. A. Schwarz, 
in company with Mr. Hubbard, secured several species in the 
Santa Rita Mountains, at Catalina Springs, near the old Camp 
Lowell, at Oracle, and at Tucson. The Barber and Schwarz 
collection was made at Bright Arigel (Grand Canyon of the 
Colorado River), Flagstaff, Prescott, Williams, Winslow, and at 
Hot Springs, in Yavapai County. Finally, Mr. E. J. Oslar made 
collections at the following localities: Congress, Hot Springs, 
Jerome, Prescott, Rio Verde and Thumb Butte. The Hubbard, 
Schwarz and Barber specimens are in the National Museum, and 
the specimens from Oslar in the collection of Mr. Nathan Banks. 
A few individuals labeled "Ariz.," from the American Entomo 
logical Society collection, and two in the National Museum from 
" So. Arizona " (O. C, Poling), are also included. 

The following list embraces thirty species and two varieties, 
including the nine forms seven species and two varieties here 
considered as new and so described. These figures will be appre 
ciated when we remember that, including these new forms, hardly 
more than fifty recognized species are now known from the entire 
United States, and of this number eleven species and one variety 
are not yet known outside of Arizona and have been described 
during the last six years. 

The ranges of certain species in Arizona accord well with 
what is known concerning geographical distribution. For ex 
ample, the Lower Sonoran fauna of Phoenix includes such forms 
as Brachyneinurus carrizonus, B. quadripunctatus,\\\e species 
of Acanthaclisis and Maracandula pygmaea, while in the 
Transition zone (Prescott, etc.) occur more northern forms, 
such as Brachynemurus nigrilabris, B. brunncus and Myr- 
meleon immaculatus, variety occidcntalis. Species of wide dis 
tribution B. ferox (peregrinus} , B. sackcni, Dendroleon 
obsolctus, etc. seem to occur quite generally throughout the 
Territory. 

I wish to express my thanks to Mr. Charles C. Adams for the 
use of his large and valuable collection. It gives me pleasure 
also to acknowledge the important assistance rendered by Mr. 
Nathan Banks in furnishing locality records from his duplicate 
and other material, and in giving me the opportunity of studying 
his collection, including the types of all his species.

Mr. Banks* has made this species a synonym of Hagen's 
blandus^ but this is certainly a mistake. I have recently seen 
specimens quite distinct from coquilletti which correspond per-

fectly with Hagen's description.* In these specimens the cT 
appendages are much longer and more slender than in coquilletti, 
at least half as long as the last abdominal segment; the tibial 
spurs are not longer than the two basal joints of the tarsi, while in 
coquilletti they are as long as the four basal joints. There are 
also other differences. 

Brachynemurus hubbardii Currie. 

B. cockerelli Banks. 

I have examined the type of cockerelli and can find no differ 
ence between it and this species. Mr. Banks, in the remarks 
following his description,! says : " From J3. htibbardi it is dis 
tinct by the yellow color, markings of head, etc." But typical hub 
bardii is yellow or yellowish, and the markings of the head are 
not, in my opinion, essentially different; in some examples of 
the new variety nubcculipennis the longitudinal median line on 
the face is not apparent, showing that these head markings are 
subject to variation. The confusion as to color maybe explained 
by the fact that, at the time cockerelli was described, Mr. Banks 
did not possess true hubbardii, all his specimens belonging to 
nubeculipennis.

stead of yellowish, rather densely hirsute, the fore wings narrower, quite 
extensively and evenly sprinkled with fine fuscous cloudings principally 
on the smaller forks and the extremities of the transverse veins; the hind 
wings also sometimes have similar, but fainter, cloudings, or at least 
have one at tip of median vein.

I can find no other differences between this and typical hub 
bardii, yet the two forms are readily distinguished in nearly 
every case. One specimen cited above, " So. Arizona, Poling," 
is similar in color to the variety nubeculipennis, but the wings 
are not more spotted than in the typical form and the wing- 
veins are yellowish instead of luteous. It is somewhat uncertain 
to which form it should be assigned and it may be best to class it 
as an intermediate. Two other luteous specimens, broken, from 
Columbus, Texas, July, 1879 (E. A. Schwarz), and Carrizo 
Springs, Texas, August 25, 1885 (Dr. A. Wadgymar), probably 
belong to the variety, though the latter specimen has small, al-

the superior dark line on middle and posterior femora merely

band, interrupted in the middle, on the elevated portion, appearing as two 
large, approximate spots which are broadest within. Pronotal stripes 
heavier and longer, sometimes almost coalescentat transverse furrow and 
anterior margin, making the pronotal pattern much as in B.ferox, the 
outer as well as the inner pair surpassing the transverse furrow and barely 
interrupted. It lacks the pair of spots near hind margin of the posterior 
lobe of mesono'.um and the dot on each lateral lobe of metanotum. Ap

It was for a long time a problem where to place this specimen. 
The identity of the appendages with those of B. carrizonus nat

the great differences in the markings and the many resemblances 
to B. quadripunctatus seemed to forbid this solution of the dif

either species.

Lower Siam, collected by Dr. W. L. Abbott. The first of these 
was Vespa doryloidcs Saussure, a curious species bearing a super 
ficial resemblance to male ants of the genus Dorylus as well as 
to species of the genera Eciton and Labidus. They repre 
sent a distinct genus for which Mr. Ash me ad proposed the name 
Provcspa. The other species was a single specimen belonging 
to the genus Ischnogaster. This genus is found only in the 
tropics, and is most numerously represented in India. The spe 
cies of the genus have, until recently, been classified with the 
social wasps Polistes and Vespa, but in reality belong in the 
family Eumenidae. Although the Eumenidae belong with the 
solitary wasps, yet some Indian species of Eumenes, as well as 
certain species of 'Ischnogaster, are said to be social.

Vcspa mandarina Smith, from Japan. It belongs in the genus

Dr. Dyar presented the following note for publication : 

NOTE ON CRAMBUS OFFECTALIS HULST AND ALLIED 

FORMS. 

(Evetria neomexicana^ n. sp.) 
By HARRISON G. DYAR. 

Hulst described " Crawbus offectalis" in 1886, saying it 
" Takes a place best in the exciccatus group." The species is, 
however, really a Tortricid, and was rescued from its erroneous 
position by Prof. Fernald, who placed it in Pcedisca (g with 
costal fold) in Smith's list of 1891. Since then Prof. Fernald 
has obviously received males, since in Bulletin 52, U. S. National 
Museum, he removes it to Thiodia {Semasia}, which has no 
costal fold in the male, and he makes bucephaloides Walsingham 
a synonym of it. Prof. Fernald has kindly identified a specimen 
of T. offectalis for me, and I have six others, all collected in Col 
orado. This identification is, I believe, correct, for Hulst's 
description applies to my specimens. The species has a structu 
ral peculiarity in that vein 4 of hind wings is coincident with 3, 
appearing absent. The same structure appears in oblitcrana 
VVals., and, according to Walsinghem,* in elongana Wals. and 
in the European pupillana Linn, and wimmerana Treit. I think 
that these species ought to be separated generically from. Thiodia 
on this character, but I am not prepared to say what generic name 
should be used. Now, bucephaloides VVals. does not look to me 
anything like offectalis Hulst ; besides which it has veins 3 and 4

of hind wings stalked, not coincident* Therefore the synonymy 
given in Bulletin 52 must be erroneous. 

Lately Cockerell describedf a Tortricid larva injuring pine in 
New Mexico, and identified the adult as Semasia offectalis Hulst, 
on Prof. Fernald's authority. I do not know the conditions affect 
ing this determination, but it is certainly erroneous as applied to 
the species about which Prof. Cockerell intended to write. Prof. 
.Cockerell has just sent me a specimen with a pupa skin accom 
panying it, and labelled " Las Vegas, N. M. (Ckll.) Semasia 
offectalis (Hulst)." It is certainly not the species so named for 
me by Prof. Fernald, but appears to be a true Rctinia (Evetria).

Mr. Barber read the following letter, written from Cuba, by 

Mr. Schwarz : 

A LETTER FROM CUBA. 

CAYAMAS, CUBA, March 3, 1903. 

During a brief stay at Havana I looked over the Gundlach 
collection, which is now preserved in a large room in the Second 
High School building on Obispo street. The collection illus 
trates the whole domain of zoology of Cuba, including the birds 
and some insects of Porto Rico. It is in excellent state of preser 
vation, but the smaller species of insects cannot be examined 
closely because they are in rather high and hermetically sealed 
glass boxes. The collection does not contain any types, but is 
manifestly of considerable value to the student of Cuban ento 
mology. 

On February I9th I set out for my destination, but not being

acquainted with the exact location of Cayamas I had of course 
some trouble in getting there. However, after spending an entire 
day on the railroad and changing cars twice, I finally reached 
Campinas, from which place a two hours' ride in a Cuban volanta 
brought me and my baggage safely to Cayamas, where I was most 
hospitably received by Mr. Eduardo Ferrer. 

Cayamas is in the southwestern part of the province of Santa 
Clara, about 5 miles northwest of Yaguaramas, and only about 8 
miles distant from the south coast. The country hereabout is 
almost flat, or rather very gently rolling, the more elevated parts 
being dry and rather sandy, the soil of the lower portions con 
sisting of a red loam. 

This being the dry season here, which corresponds with our 
northern winter, flora and insect fauna are more or less dormant 
in spite of the warm weather, and vegetables can only be raised 
by means of constant irrigation. Hardly any flowers are to be 
seen anywhere ; a few common looking butterflies are flying 
about ; also three or four species of dragon flies ; a large Anthrax 
and a large syrphid fly are common enough on the paths; mos 
quitoes and Hippelates flies are locally quite abundant, but other 
Diptera are not obvious at this season. Hymenoptera are still 
scarcer ; a gigantic Scoliid and a jet black carpenter bee are fly 
ing about, and the few flowers are visited by a multitude of wild 
honey bees. 

There are only two small fields of cultivated cotton here be 
sides a number of scattered wild cotton plants, all of which have 
been examined by me with great care. About the original food 
plant of Anthonomus grandis I have reported my observations 
to Dr. Howard. The few other species of insects that can be 
found feeding on cotton have but little economic importance ex 
cept the cotton stainer, Dysdercus suturellus, and the "bibija- 
gua " (Atta cephalotes}. 

In my search for any other possible food plant of Anthonomus 
grandis I have of course examined every malvaceous plant I 
could discover, and I am also vigorously using my beating net 
and umbrella in the hope of finding this weevil upon some other 
plant. In doing so I am gradually accumulating quite a collec 
tion of the insects that can be found here at this early season, 
mostly Coleoptera. The dry sandy ridges are partly covered 
with dense tall grass, which is now dead, and which furnishes but 
a few species of insects, and partly with a sort of dry hammock 
resembling in general appearance the dry palmetto hammocks of 
central Florida, and having also a very scant insect fauna at this 
season. 

The loamy lowlands of this region were originally covered 
with one mighty forest, but this has long since disappeared and 
is now replaced by monotonous sugar-cane fields. The insect 
fauna within these fields and along their edges is also monoto- 



288 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

nous and not rich in species. In many places the soil has become 
completely exhausted by constant cultivation of the sugar-cane, 
and the fields are now overgrown by a perfect wilderness of tall 
weeds. One of these, a gigantic Solanum, has a little insect 
fauna of its own, which is of interest because the same species 
{Anthonomusvaripes^ Baridius 4-maculatus, Epitrix pat"vula, 
a sphinx larva and an aphis, with its attending Coccinellidsj are 
to be found on the cultivated egg-plant. 

A few hundred yards distant from the settlement is the only 
remnant of what was once an extended tropical forest about 50 
acres being still covered with mighty trees, of which I recognize 
only a few species. There is a delightfully dense undergrowth 
of smaller bushes and vines, so that locomotion is quite difficult. 
At the first sight this timberland seems to be occupied by only 
a few species of insects, viz., Eukcrmes morio, two species of 
Pseudomyrma (P. pallida and another brown species), and two 
species of mosquitoes. However, a little more careful investiga 
tion reveals an astonishing richness of insect life, chiefly Cole- 
optera. On the living vegetation very little can be seen : a few 
Chrysomelidas, chiefly Halticids ; a few Elateridas, a Lampyrid, 
some Curculionidae, a peculiar genus of AleocharidaB, etc. ; but 
on or in the dead vines and branches insects of all sorts abound 
in specimens and species, so that I cannot possibly enumerate 
them here. Among the Coleoptera the most characteristic forms 
areas follows: numerous species of Cryptorhynchid Rhyncho- 
phora of the genera Acalles, Cryptorhynchus. Pseudomus, etc. ; 
numerous species of Anthribidas, a host of small Lamiid Ceram- 
bycidaB of the genera Leptostylus, Lepturges, Hyperplatys, etc. ; 
abundance of species and specimens of Elaphidion, a host of 
little Clavicorn beetles of various families, and finally a good 
number of small Heteromerous species. 

As a whole I find the Coleopterous fauna here more different 
from that of semi-tropical Florida than I expected, but among 
the species common to both countries I notice several the occur 
rence of which in Cuba has not yet been recorded, e. g., Eustil- 
bus princeps, Moncedus guttatus, Aspathines ovatus and 
Eiixenus piceus. 

A good-sized creek meanders through this forest, but its bed 
is now r dry as tinder, and the hygrophilous insect fauna has 
retired into cracks in the soil. I noticed, however, that at sunset 
at least a portion of this fauna comes out of the ground to enjoy 
flying about, and by spreading a white cloth many, mostly very 
minute, species can thus be found. Others come to light later in 
the evening. 

A couple of miles farther out is another creek which contains 
a few water holes with a rather uninteresting insect fauna con 
sisting of a few Dytiscids and Hydrophilids, with many Clivina, 
Falagria, Trogophlreus, etc., running about on the wet ground.

They use acetylene gas in the dwelling house, and a number of 
Noctuids and Microlepidoptera, all species differing from those 
known to me from Florida, are attracted by the light; also large 
and small Blattidaa and quite a number of Coleoptera, which I 
fail to find during daytime, the most interesting of them being a 
Dacoderus, which may be different from the species described 
by Dr. Horn from Santo Domingo. 

E. A. SCHWARZ. 



Dr. Howard said that Mr. Schwarz had found what may prove 
to be the original food plant of the Cotton-boll Weevil (Ant/ion- 
omus grandis Boheman), namely, the wild "kidney cotton" 
( Gossypium brasiliense?}. 

Dr. Hopkins read extracts from two letters from Mr. D. 
Cappelen, Sandviken, Hovin P. O., Thelemarken, Norway, 
concerning a recent destructive outbreak of the "'Pine Bombyx" 
(Dendrolimus pini Linnaeus). Since the .outbreak of 1812 tq 
1816, the writer states, this moth has not occurred in sufficient 
numbers to cause serious damage, but last year one urea of 1,000 
acres of redwood forest (Plnus sylvatica) was destroyed, as well 
as other areas of from 50 to roo acres, while some 25,000 acres 
were infested with larva?, and their destruction threatened the 
coming season. The area of infestation was practically the same 
as in 1812 to the east and northeast of Lake Mjosen. The cor 
respondent stated also that at the time his first letter was written 
(October 22. 1902), the larvae were to be found under the rein 
deer moss (Cladonia rhangifcria}, which was covered with 
three inches of snow. They seemed to be healthy specimens'and 
practically free from fungus diseases. Mr. Cappelen was in 
clined to attribute the enormous increase of the moth to the past 
three or four very dry seasons. He hoped that steps would be 
taken to test the value of different parasitic fungi, such as the 
muscardine ( Cordyceps militaris) and Cordyceps melolonthce^ 
in fighting the pest. The remedy most in vogue in preventing 
the spread of the larva? was to apply a belt of German glue to the 
trunks of the trees. Dr. Hopkins thought that it would be well 
to guard against a possible introduction of the bombyx into North 
America. 

Dr. Howard asked Dr. Hopkins what theory was put forth to 
explain why there had been no outbreak between 1812 and the 
present time in that locality. Dr. Hopkins replied that in 1812 



290 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

the outbreak followed a series of dry seasons, as was the case now. 
He thought that such a series of dry seasons was necessary for so 
extraordinary an increase of the species, and that there had prob 
ably been no such conditions prevailing during the interval be 
tween the two outbreaks. When the season was dry the larvas 
were much more free from fungi, of course. 

Dr. Howard stated that the Norwegian officials had sent to the 
Division of Entomology, U. S. Department of Agriculture, for 
the locust SporotricJnim, as they wished to see if it could be used 
against the pine bombyx. 

Dr. Dyar reported some early dates for the hatching of mos 
quito eggs. Eggs of Culex canadcnsis, laid at Center Harbor, 
New Hampshire, last August, and kept by him over winter at 
Washington, had hatched on the 9th of March. Mr. J. Turner 
Brakeley, at Lahaway, New Jersey, had found larvae of the same 
species, under the ice, some time in February. 

Speaking of mosquitoes, Mr. Banks reported that he had 
taken Megarhinus portoricensis at Washington last August, and 
Mr. Kotinsky reported having collected M. rutilus along Rock 
Creek, in the District of Columbia, during the past summer. 

Mr. Banks exhibited a nest of the purse-web spider (Atypus 
abboti Hentz) which he had found at Falls Church. The species 
is rare here, though known as far north as Massachusetts. 

Upon invitation, Dr. Holland gave an account of the insect 
collections in the Carnegie Museum in Pittsburg, and told of the 
work which was being done-there and of that which was contem 
plated. In reply to a query he stated that the "Moth Book" 
which he was preparing would be published soon, and would 
contain illustrations of 1,800 different moths. 

Dr. Dyar then presented the following paper :

Platyptilia marmarodactyla, n. sp. 

Stone gray, with a bright pinkish ochraceous mark at base of first 
feather. Fore wing gray, shading to reddish along inner margin, with 
irregular tufts of black scales along the edge; a rounded triangular, pink 
ish ocherous patch, resting on the fissure at base of first feather and nar 
rowly touching costa, preceded by a transverse black.bar before the fissure ; 
a subterminal white line on both feathers. Hind wing gray, with an 
irregular row of spathulate scales on the margin of third feather. Ex 
panse. 15.5 to 17 mm. 

Seven specimens: Los Angeles Co., California, April (A. 
Koebele) ; Las Vegas Hot Springs, New Mexico, August S, i^ 
and 18 (Schwarz and Barber) ; Santa Rita Mountains, Arizona 
(E. A. Schwarz).

The three California!! specimens have been submitted to Lord 
Walsingham in 1887, and to Prof. Fernald at a later date. The 
former endorsed them "Amblyptz'lia, near cosmodactyla Hiibn.," 
and the latter " I do not feel prepared to separate this from P. 
cosmodactyla H." I think, however, that the species is distinct 
from cosmodactyla.

emerged in Mr. Busck's hands, the present species, Lophoderus 
color adana Fernald* and the following species. I therefore con 
tent myself with the record of the food plant. 

Eucosma pulsatillana, n. sp. 

Near improbana Walker and radicana Walsingham and the gray form 
of m'sella Clerck. Fore wings moderately elongate, costa strongly arched ; 
gray, irrorate with black. Basal space broadly dark as in nt'sella-, the out 
wardly limiting line bowed outward a little at the middle, slightly oblique, 
so that the space is broader on internal margin than on costa, coarsely 
irrorate with black. A dark gray bar, limited by irregular black scales, 
starts from the middle of the cos'a and bends outward to the middle of the 
disk, narrowly, but sharply and squarely separated from a similar short, 
curved bar arising from the anal angle ; a dark costal dash throws a waved, 
irregular line obliquely to above anal angle; three costal dashes beyond 
this, the outermost largest and reaching opposite the middle of margin; 
a terminal black band, wide centrally; fringe gray, irrorate in black. In 
some specimens the lower part of the basal space and the bar at the anal 
angle are shaded with ocherous. Hind wing light silky grayish. Ex 
panse, 15 to 17 mm. 

Twenty males and eight females bred from larva? found web 
bing the leaves of Pulsatilla hirsutissima high on the foothills 
at Boulder and Golden, Colorado. 

Type. No. 6768, U. S. National Museum. 

Eucosma cercocarpana, n. sp. 

Veins 3 to 5 of fore wings are converged toward a marginal incision. 
The wings are elongate and narrow, costa convex, inner margin concave 
before the anal angle. Markings closely as in improbana Walker, but the 
median band is more oblique and there is a dark marking subapically. 

Dark gray, the lighter parts of fore wings with shining, slightly raised 
scales. A large dark basal space, sharply limited outwardly and with a 
central angle, is irrorate with black scales on a dull olivaceous brown 
ground. Beyond the ground is cinereous, irrorated with olivaceous. An 
oblique bar from near basal third of costa to before anal angle is cut by a 
longitudinal black dash which causes a projection on each side, the inner 
one nearly or quite touching the projection of the basal patch- another 
projection from the bar on its outer side near inner margin extends nearly 
perpendicularly upward. Beyond and above the black bar is a second 
less evident one, situated in the upper part of an olive brown cloud sub 
apically. A small black apical dash with olivaceous brown below on 
fringe. A row of small, oblique, costal bars. Fringe dark gray on lower 
two-thirds of termen. Hind wing brownish gray, darker outwardly. 
Expanse, 15 to 18 mm.

THE ODONATA COLLECTED BY MESSRS. SCHWARZ AND 
BARBER IN ARIZONA AND NEW MEXICO. 

By ROLLA P. CURRIE. 

A list of the dragonflies collected in Arizona and New Mexico 
during the summer of 1901 by Messrs. E. A. Schwarz and H. S. 
Barber is of sufficient interest to merit publication. Collecting 
operations extended from the last week in May till the middle of 
August, and 172 specimens were secured, representing 24 species 
and two varieties. Of this number one species, an Ischmira, is 
here described as new and named in honor of Mr. Barber who

Soc., iv, p. 87, 1896.

devoted special attention to securing these insects. It may be 
well, by way of introduction, to give a brief account of the 
localities visited, as Mr. Schwarz and Mr. Barber have described 
them to me. 

The last week in May and the first two weeks in June were 
spent at Williams, as well as the last of June and several days 
in July before and after visiting the Grand Canyon. Here a 
small stream flowing down from Bill Williams Mountain had 
been dammed in several places to furnish water for the saw-mill ; 
thus a number of good sized ponds or small lakes had been made, 
and along the shores of these, and of another pond on a small 
stream about a quarter of a mile distant, the dragonflies were 
taken. Mr. Barber tells me that these streams had dried up be 
fore he left Williams, leaving water in the ponds only. The al 
titude of Williams is about 6700 feet. 

Flagstaff, with an elevation of 6,940 feet, had a permanent 
supply of running water. Otherwise the country was much like 
that of Williams. Here about a week was spent and Odonata 
were collected along an open sewer of running water, and also 
at a reservoir situated about three miles from the town. 

At Ash fork the country was extremely dry everywhere and 
the only water to be found was a small pond of waste from the 
railway engine tank, although the dry bed of a creek indicated 
that there had been water there at one time. This place has an 
elevation about 1,000 feet less than that of Williams. 

Hot Springs, in Yavapai County, about fifty miles north of 
Phoenix, proved a most interesting collecting ground, and many 
new and rare species in various groups of insects were captured 
here. At this place the new species of Ischnura was found. In 
the "four tanks," a succession of large water-filled potholes in 
the rocks, a number of interesting dragonfly larva? were obtained, 
while adults of various species were flying over a small stream 
fed by the hot springs. Near the hotel were several fountains of 
tepid water piped from the springs, and around these all the speci 
mens of Telebasis salva were taken, while Argia violacea, variety 
pallens, occurred along a sewer leading from the buildings. The 
altitude of Hot Springs is about 2,300 feet. 

Within the Grand Canyon nearly all the specimens.were col 
lected along a spring-fed stream, about a foot and a half wide and 
six inches deep, lined on either side by willows and tall, coarse 
grass. The spring is situated about 4,000 feet below the brink of 
the canyon and some 2,000 feet above the river. Mr. Barber 
descended the canyon to this point on two successive days for the 
purpose of making collections. Here, among other species, he 
found the Mexican Hctczrina vulnerata and Cordulegaster dia 
dem a. 

Mr. Schwarz tells me that swallows and dragonflies are the 



300 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

only winged creatures he saw flying down into the canyon. But 
terflies and other insects, and birds other than swallows, would 
turn back upon reaching the brink as if afraid to venture further. 
As there is no water around the Bright Angel Hotel or anywhere 
in its vicinity, and none below the brink till" one comes to the 
spring just mentioned, it appears that the species captured at the 
brink (Argia moesta, Herpetogomphus compositus and Sympe- 
trum corruptuiri) must have come up from the spring, or, in 
other words, ascended from the Lower Sonoran zone to the Tran 
sition zone. It is noteworthy, however, that these are all species 
which have a wide geographical distribution not confined to any 
one zone ; no exclusively Lower Sonoran species was seen to 
ascend to the brink of the canyon or was found above its normal 
habitat. The elevation above sea level of the Bright Angel Hotel, 
on the brink of the canyon, is about the same as that of Williams. 

At Winslow most of the species were obtained along an irriga 
tion ditch full of clear, 'swiftly-running water, although a few 
were taken over a very muddy, stagnant branch of the Little Col 
orado river. Winslow's elevation is very much less than that of 
Williams, probably about 5,400 feet. 

Las Vegas Hot Springs, New Mexico (altitude 6800 feet) was 
the last locality visited. Here the first two weeks of August were 
passed, collections being made along the Galliuas river, and here, 
among other species, Hyponcura lugens and Argia vivida, 
variety plana, occurred. 

The following list includes all the adults taken. The nymphs 
were submitted for study to Dr. James G. Needham. I am in 
debted to Dr. Philip P. Calvert for obligingly going over and veri 
fying my determinations and helping me in many other ways. 
The bibliographic references to the species are not given here but 
may be found for the Zygoptera, in the Odonata part of the 
Biologia Centrali-Americana, and for the Anisoptera, in Kirby's

below, an isolated round postocular spot each side, margins of prothorax, 
sides of meso- and metathorax (except a short superior line on first lateral 
suture and a long one on the second), an antehumeral stripe each side 
and a transversely oblique line each side, behind or above them, pectus, 
feet (except a superior stripe on femora' and tibiae and extreme apex of 
tarsal joints), i (except a basal spot on dorsum), sides and venter of 2-7, 
all of 8 and 9, 10 (except dorsum). A transverse, basal, interrupted yel 
low ring on 3-7. Dark band on 2 narrowed apically, that on 3-6 widened 
on apical fourth, constricted just before it, much less constricted on 6. 

Forked elevation on 10 not much more than half as high as 10, rising 
at a gradual slope and in a straight line from the base of the segment; 
forked in less than its apical half; branches forming an angle of about 90. 
Superior appendages short, rather stout, about one-half as long as 10, 
tubercular, with a pointed, inferior, apical process, which is hardly longer 
than the other part of the appendage. Inferior appendages nearly as long 
as 10, yellowish except at tip, broad at base, the outer side prolonged as 
a process the tip of which is acute and curved inwards; inner side also 
prolonged into a broad, flattened, rounded, shorter process, thus making 
the appendage bifid. 

Wings clear. Fore wings with eight postcubitals in first series. Nodal 
sector arising between the third and fourth (nearer the fourth) postcubital 
on fore wings, near third on hind wings (on left wing at the third, on 
right wing between second and third, on this specimen). Pterostigma on 
front wings surmounting a little less than one cell, longer than wide, 
outer side straight; blackish, the outer corner pale; on hind wings paler. 

Abdomen 24.5, hind wing 15.5 mm.

(exstriata Culvert), but is larger, possesses an antehumeral 
stripe, is without black markings on 8 and 9, the appendages are 
stouter and are longer in proportion to the length of the last 
segment, while the inferior process of the superiors is shorter. 
The inner prolongation of the inferior appendages seems to be a 
peculiarity of this species.

Specimens of the most interesting species were shown. 

The paper was discussed by several of the members. Mr. 
Banks said that it could hardly be true that dragonflies and 
swallows are the only winged creatures which venture over the 
brink of the canyon for these were undoubtedly in pursuit of their 
accustomed prey small flies, gnats, etc. 

Under the title tk Some remarks on Japanese Hymenoptera," 
Mr. Ashmead showed a number of interesting species from Japan 
and commented upon them. The National Museum, he said, has 
now qui^t)a representation of Japanese insects. The first acces 
sion of importance was the collection received from the World's 
Fair at Chicago, through Mr. Mitsukuri, of the Imperial Uni 
versity of Tokyo. Since then a number of smaller collections 
had come in from various sources. Of the Hymenoptera in the 
collection the Aculeata belonged mostly to species already 
described, but in the Parasitica probably 150 new species and 
several new genera were represented. There were, he judged, 
in the neighborhood of 500 described species of Japanese Hymen 
optera. He alluded to the wide distribution of certain Japanese 
bees, some species of which were found as far south as India. 

Following the paper, Messrs. Howard, Holland, Pollard, Gill, 
and Marlatt discussed the zoo-geographical conditions prevailing 
in the Japanese islands, not only as shown by the insects but by 
the fishes and plants.

A NOTE ON PYRAUSTA OCHOSALIS FITCH, MS. 
By HARRISON G. DYAR. 

Fitch's specimen (No. 406) has been in the National Museum 
collection under Pyrausta generosa G. & R., but it differs obvi 
ously from that species. The yellow spot without the t-p. line 
on the costa is very small, and there is a larger one within the 
line rilling its outward bend at the end of the cell. The yellow 
spot between the reniform and orbicular is very small, usually 
absent. The species is also smaller. It closely resembles the 
European Pyrausta aurata Scop., having all the same mark 
ings, but the vellow band on hind wings is more outwardly 
placed and less diminished costally in the American than in the 
European form. Our specimens are from : 

[New York] (Fitch collection, 406 and 6580) ; New York 
(H. S. Burnett) ; Chicago, 111. (A. Kwiat) ; Taoz, New Mexico, 
June 14, 1875 (Wheeler survey) ; Rio Ruidoso, White Moun 
tains, New Mexico, July 31 and August i (C. H. T. Townsend). 
Also a specimen with the band on hind wings narrower and 
whitish from " top of range, June 26 " [New Mexico] (T. D. A. 
Cockerell). 



Dr. Dyar showed a living larva oiffemileuca electra Wright, 
sent for inspection by Mr. O. C. Poling. The species lives in South 
ern California and is among our rarest Saturnians. A description 
of the larva has been published by Mr. Coquillett (Journ. N. Y. 
Ent. Soc., vi, p. 250, 1898). The specimen shown looks very 
like a larva of Pscudohazis except for the gray cast that the 
white dots on the secondary hairs give. The upper row of warts 
has a short shaft on joints 4-12 (single on joint 12), the spines 
arising in a bunch. The other warts are in the form of long 
branching spines. The white subdorsal and lateral lines are 
straight, the substigmatal one waved. There are no spines on 
the anal plate, though it is hairy. There is an unpaired long 
dorsal spine on joint 13. 

Dr. Dyar presented also the description of a Tortricid con 
stituting a new genus and species, Phthinolophus indentanus, as 
follows :

NOTE ON A WRONGLY IDENTIFIED SPECIES OF TOR- 
TRICID^E. 

{Phthinolophus indentanus, n. gen. and sp.) 
By HARRISON G. DYAR. 

Two years ago I described* the larva of Cerorrhirieta\ 
calidana Zeller, identified by Prof. Fernald with a query, the 
larvae on Eugenia from Florida. Another specimen in the 
collection of Mr. Philip Laurent, of Philadelphia, collected at 
Mt. Airy, Pennsylvania, bears Prof. Fernald's label, in his own 
handwriting, this time without the query. Mr. Laurent has 
other specimens from Anglesea, New Jersey, and I have a series 
bred on wax myrtle {Myrica cerifera) at the Department of 
Agriculture under the number 3422, June, 1884, from Fortress 
Monroe, Virginia. In all 41 specimens are before me. The 
Myrica specimens were submitted to Lord Walsingham in 1884 
and labelled u Pcedisca, n. sp." Prof. Fernald has a specimen 
sent him in 1898 and still unreported upon except to the effect that 
it was not the Florida species. In my opinion, however, there is 
but a single species before me, and that with but a small range 
of variation. 

I feel reluctantly compelled to dissent from Prof. Fernald's 
determination. Zeller described Cerorrhineta\ as "Die erste 
bekannte Wicklergattung in welcher die mannlichen Fiihler, wie 
bei Pempelia und Nephopteryx, doch ohne Krummung der 
Geissel, dttrch rauhe Schuppen zu einem langlichen Knoten ver- 
dickt sind," and ; 'Beim tf derganze Vorderrand bis nahe an die 
Spitze zuriickgeschlagen ist." In the specimens before me there 
is no knot-like thickening of the cT antennas as in Nephopteryx, 
but a long, slight thickening with a notch near its end as in 
Tmetocera. The $ costal fold does not reach over half the 
length of the costal margin. In the specific description of 
calidana, Zeller does not describe any of the characteristic mark 
ings of the specimens before me. If further proof were needed, 
Walsingham's discussion and figure of the venation show a 
very different insect, belonging to the TortricinaB and allied to 
Capua, whereas the form before me belongs to the OlethreutinaB 
near Tmetocera.

Mr. Ashmead exhibited an interesting new genus and species 
of wasp, described in the following paper : 

MYRMECOSALIUS, A NEW GENUS IN THE CEROPALID^E. 
By WILLIAM H. ASHMEAD. 

Apterous and subapterous Ceropalidae are rare, there being 
only three or four species known, so that the species described 
below, which represents a new genus in the subfamily Pepsince, 
is of great interest. It was discovered by Dr. William M. 



308 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

Wheeler, in Texas, living in the nest of the harvesting ant, Pogo- 
nomyrmex barbatus Smith, and was sent to me some months ago. 
It may be predaceous upon some of the curious arachnids living 
in ant nests in Texas. 

Myrmecosalius, n. gen. 

9- Wings rudimentary, narrowed, not quite reaching to the metathora- 
cic spiracles, and with only two basal cells, the stigma, radial, cubital and 
discoidal cells being wholly absent; head, legs, and abdomen as in Salius 
{Priocnemis)\ thorax narrowed, the prothorax only two-thirds as wide as 
the head, the mesothorax contracted, the mesonotum being rather small, 
shorter, and much narrower than the pronptum ; the scutellum is small, 
rounded behind, the postscutellum hardly one-third the length of the scu_ 
tellum ; metathorax longer than wide, convexly rounded, the spiracles 
linear. <$ unknown. 

Myrmecosalius nigriceps, n. sp. 

9- Length, 5.5 to 6 mm. Head, except the clypeus, the mandibles, 
and the palpi, and the antennae, except the first three joints, which are 
brownish-yellow, black; the clypeus, mandibles, thorax, legs, and the 
abdomen, except the pygium and the hypopygium which are black, wholly 
ferruginous. The head is finely, closely punctulate, opaque, the thorax 
finely, microscopically shagreened, while the abdomen is smooth, shining, 
although under a strong lens it is seen to be microscopically shagreened 
and finely sericeous or downy.

Dr. Howard referred to a recent paper by Mr. Charles T. 
Brues in the Biological Bulletin on the messmates of ants of the 
genus Jzciton. Among the species treated in this paper as found 
in these ants' nests were some Proctotrypoids belonging to new 
species in the Ceraphronidas, and a Telenomus. It was note 
worthy, he said, that no aphids nor coccids were found in the 
nests, but a large number of flies of the family Phoridse. The 
Ceraphronids were probably parasitic upon the Phori-d larva?, 
but what did the Telenomus parasitize ? Dr. Howard thought 
they possibly attacked the ants' eggs. 

Mr. Ashmead said he thought they might be parasitic on 
spiders' eggs, as spiders had been found in some of the ants' 
nests. 

Mr. Warner showed a hymenopterous parasite belonging to 
the Proctotrypoid genus Scelio, stating that he had found it 
attached by its mandibles between the base of the wing and the 



OF WASHINGTON. 309 

hind legs of a specimen of grasshopper, Dichromorpha viridis 
Scudder, in the National Museum collection. 

Mr. Ashmead remarked that the members of the genus Scelio 
were parasitic on the eggs of grasshoppers, and that it was the 
habit of the female to attach itself to the gravid female grass 
hopper and wait for the latter to deposit its eggs. 

Mr. Banks stated that Dr. David Sharp, in the Cambridge 
Natural History, records a specimen of Podagrion found on a 
female Mantid, the members of this genus being parasites of 
mantis' eggs. 

Dr. Hopkins reported some observations made upon a recent 
trip to North Carolina. At Asheville he found twigs of pine 
thickly covered with dipterous galls. These galls were in the 
bark, and formed pits in the wood. The larvas, covered with 
resin, were crawling out of the galls on to the bark and needles. 
He noticed that this resin covering the larvas was the external 
substance used in forming the cocoons, and also served to attach 
the cocoon securely to the twig. Ratzeburg had described the 
cocoon, but not the gall, and it appeared that the latter had never 
been described. It probably belonged to some species of Diplo- 
sis, according to Mr. Coquillett. Some of the larvae did not come 
out, but remained in the galls to pupate. 

Dr. Hopkins reported, also, that in the swamps of North Caro 
lina many of the cypresses which are girdled by the lumbermen, 
and left standing a year before being cut down, were considerably 
damaged by ambrosia beetles. He found that the presence or 
absence of this infestation depended upon the time of year when 
the girdling was done. Sweet-gum and black-gum trees were 
girdled in a similar manner, and were subject to the same attacks 
by the beetles. He found many interesting insects on these gir 
dled trees. 

Dr. Howard said he considered Dr. Hopkins' observations of 
special interest as having a bearing on the question of the ovi- 
position of Diplosis resinicola. He thought the latter species 
might lay its eggs on the bark and not in the resin as has been 
supposed. He said that Packard considered the needle gall as 
a different species from the twig gall, and described it as Diplosis 
pini-rigidce. 

Mr. Heidemann exhibited a specimen of the Aradid bug 



310 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

Neuroctenus pseudonemus Bergroth, collected at Bladensburg, 
Maryland, on March 26, under bark. The species was described 
originally from " Carolina," and has not before been recorded 
from the District of Columbia. He showed, also, a specimen of 
Neuroctenus simplex Say, the species found commonly around 
Washington. JV. pseudonemus is much the larger of the two 
forms. 

Prof. Uhler remarked that this species is very large for our 
fauna, and has an almost tropical appearance. In the tropics 
some species of Aradidas attain a length of about three quarters 
of an inch. He mentioned a species described by-Champion 
from Central America, which lives under fungi, and bears little 
knob-like protuberances on its pronotum. These serve to scrape 
off and distribute over the back a powdery material from the fun 
gus, giving the bug a spotted appearance not natural to it. 

Mr. Banks showed a specimen of a large Syrphid fly ( Ccria 
willistonii Kahl), and presented the following note : 

NOTE ON CERIA WILLISTONII KAHL. 
By NATHAN BANKS. 

From a puparium collected on oak bark at Falls Church, 
Virginia, about the middle of March, there issued on the zyth of 
March a fly of this species, previously known from Florida, 
Texas, and Kansas. The fly has a great resemblance to certain 
conopids, and also to some wasps. It is probably identical with 
C. signifera Loew from Mexico. The larva of Ceria is sup 
posed to feed in the flowing sap of trees. I give below a short 
description of the puparium : 

Puparium dull black above, whitish below, in front with two large white 
marks separated by a narrow black spot; anal tube shining black. Dor- 
sum faintly mottled with pale, more prominent on the sides. Dorsum 
with a median row of double pointed tubercles, and a lateral row each 
side; those toward the tip are smaller than the others. Length, 18 mm. 



Mr. Banks showed, also, two rare Ortalid flies. The first 
bears a very close resemblance to an ant, as its name, Myrme- 
comyia myrmecoides Loew, would indicate. The other species, 
Odontomera ferruginea Macquart, also looks much like an ant, 
though the resemblance is not so striking. The latter was from 
the District of Columbia.

Dr. Howard stated that while the conclusions of the U. S. 
Army Commission on the subject of yellow fever were very 
generally accepted by the physicians of Central and South Amer 
ica, no corroborative experiments have been made until very 
recently. Much general incredulity has been felt in Brazil, but 
in a letter just received from Dr. Adolpho Lutz, of Sao Paulo, 
an account is given of experiments in which there were three 
positive results, the mosquitoes having been captured in an unin- 
fected place, taken -to the city, allowed to bite yellow fever 
patients and then carried to an uninfected place and allowed to 
bite non-immunes. These experiments have been accepted as 
conclusive and Brazilian incredulity has been removed. 

Prof. Uhler mentioned the fact that mosquitoes had been 
introduced at Buena Vista, in the mountains of western Mary 
land, by transportation in freight cars, and that they were now 
breeding abundantly in an ice pond which has been made there. 

Dr. Dyar then read portions of a systematic paper submitted 
for publication by Prof. John B. Smith. The paper is as follows : 



A REVISION OF THE BOREAL-AMERICAN SPECIES OF 
NONAGRIA Ochs. 

By JOHN B, SMITH, Sc.D. 

The species of this genus are poorly represented in American 
collections, and are, as a rule, uncertainly named. The adults 
are rarely taken by ordinary methods of collecting, and there is 
usually a great dearth of males : of Iceta, for instance, I know of 
only one $ example in all the collections seen. Several collec 
tors have bred small series, and there seems to be no particular 
difficulty in obtaining adults in this way ; but even in bred series 
females seem to be in the majority so far as I have been able to 
find. 

The head is not prominent, yet scarcely retracted ; moderate in 
size ; front produced into a long, pointed process, more or less 
carinate, the sides somewhat explanate, varying in the species, 
the tip sometimes notched. As a rule the straight, hairy frontal 
vestiture conceals all save the extreme tip of this process, and the 
superficial appearance is that of a pointed hair tuft. The eyes . 
are of good size, round, or nearly so, not protuberant, naked, 
without lashes or fringes. Palpi moderate, extending to the tip 
of the frontal process, vestiture of the second joint somewhat 
divergent, the third varying a little in its proportion to the sec- 



312 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

ond. Antennae extending to the middle of the wing, or a little 
beyond, simple in the female, joints somewhat marked, and with 
little tufts of short hair in the males. Tongue short, yet corne 
ous ; spiral and, perhaps, functional ; but I doubt it. Thorax 
comparatively small, quadrate, with long, flattened hairy vesti- 
ture, forming no obvious tufts, yet fairly defining the patagia ; 
the collar, however, is not relieved. Legs comparatively short, 
rather stout, middle and hind legs subequal ; the former with 
longer femora, the latter with longer tibiae. The vestiture varies 
somewhat in the species, but never forms specialized tuftings. 
Tibiae unarmed save for the usual spurs, and not spinulated. 
Tarsi tending to taper toward tip, spinulation only moderate, the 
claws concealed by the vestiture. Abdomen very long, exceed 
ing the angle of secondaries by nearly or quite half its length" ; 
very stout and cylindrical in the female, not much narrowed in 
the male ; in both sexes with a terminal tuft. Primaries varying 
somewhat in proportion to the thorax, but always seem short and 
stumpy in proportion to the abdomen ; the costa is a little arched, 
the inner margin subparallel, outer margin forming an appproxi- 
mate rectangle at apex, thence obliquely rounded to a very obtuse 
hind angle. Secondaries proportionate. The venation offers 
nothing characteristic or different from the normal. On the pri 
maries there is a little 'variation in the origin of veins y 10 ; in 
subjliva 7, 8 and 9 arise together from the end of the accessory 
cell, and 10 comes from the middle of the upper margin; in 
cblongu 7 and 9 are from the end of the accessory cell, while 8 
is out of 9 halfway to the apex, 10 being a little nearer the apex 
of the accessory cell ; in Iceta the venation is as in oblonga} in 
alamcda veins 7, 8, and 9 arise close together from the end of the 
accessory cell, but 8 and 9 are on a very short stalk and 10 is 
from the outer third of the cell. Cn the secondaries vein 5 is 
practically obsolete except in alameda, where it is quite obvious, 
but much weaker than the others. The studies on venation were 
made primarily on wings mounted in balsam, supplemented by 
examinations of other specimens from different localities. Very 
little variation is indicated, yet veins 7 to 9 of the primaries are 
those that are most subject to variation, and it is quite likely that 
there may be some divergence from the characters given here. 

One of the most characteristic features of this genus is the pecu 
liar structure of the female genitalia, which was figured and 
described by Dr. D. S. Kellicott for his subcarnea.* Seen from 
behind, there is the highly chitinized rim of an abdominal seg 
ment which covers a broad triangular upper sclerite ; this sclerite 
has thickened edges which, as they extend backward, separate into 
two flattened lobes which turn downward and in part cover the 

*Bull. Buff. Soc. Nat. Sci., v, 1885. 



OF WASHINGTON. 313 

anal opening. Almost meeting the tip of these lobes is a pair of 
lateral pieces bent from the under side so, when these are approx 
imated, the inner structures are entirely concealed (PI. VI, fig. 3). 
If these corneous structures are dissected out, cleared of scales 
and viewed laterally, the inferior side pieces are found to arise 
from the same base as the superior triangular process. Covered 
by these structures is a corneous portion furrowed into transverse 
ridges. The ovipositor opens below this ridged surface and does 
not appear in PL V, fig. 4, which illustrates this structure from 
the side. No other Noctuid genus studied by me shows any 
similar structure ; hence Nonagria stands well by itself. 

As to the use of this peculiar structure, Dr. Kellicott speaks as 
follows : " By means of this apparatus the eggs are placed for the 
winter. They are arranged, one after another, varying in number 
from a few to a hundred or more, in a tube formed by rolling 
over the margin of a withered dry leaf of the food plant. It 
appears that as the eggs are extruded and placed a little way back 
from the margin (about one-third the width), the same is then 
folded over the eggs and firmly cemented down, thus forming and 
filling the tube. The eggs thus covered with the leaf and cement 
appear to pass the winter under the snow, and more or less under 
water, unharmed. 

u I have not been so fortunate as to see the moth in the act of 
oviposition, although a number were kept for many days with 
Typha in an aquarium. I found from time to time many of the 
eggs, but visits paid by day or by night failed to discover the 
manner of the work." 

The species differ somewhat in the details of this structure ; 
but this belongs rather to the discussion under the specific 
descriptions. 

Eight species have been described from our fauna, three of them 
by Guenee, whose types I have seen in the British Museum. Two 
of the species enervata and fodiens were seen in 1891 and 
were found not properly referred to this genus ; the third, inqui- 
nata, I saw in 1900, and this also is improperly in Nonagria. 
It is a Tapinostola, and probably variana Morr. The relation 
of our described species is not settled and the specific reference 
is not definitely made for that reason. 

This leaves five nominal species, of which I have seen the types 
of the three described by Mr. Grote. Dr. Kellicott's species I have 
in specimens identified by himself and out of his type lot. Lceta 
Morr., I have been unible to trace and have not seen the type. 
I have suspected a European species, but can find nothing to 
which the description fits. Mr. Grote described what he identi 
fied as the cT of Iceta, but intimates a doubt as to whether he 
really had Mr. Morrison's species. I have seen the specimens 
in the Thaxter collection, now in the Museum of Comparative 



314 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

Zoology at Cambridge, and they agree perfectly with Mr. Grote's 
description ; but I am also in doubt whether Mr. Morrison's 
description of the female really applied to this species, of which 
I have females only. But as there is no other to which the 
description applies, even approximately, I have adopted Mr. 
Grote's identification. 

Of the names* now in the catalogue, oblonga, subcarnea, and 
permagna apply to one species only, reducing the number of 
good species to three, and to these must be added a new form 
from the Pacific coast bred by Mr. A. Koebele some years ago. 

Of three of these species I have material sufficient to study the 
male genitalia ; of Iceta I have seen only cne male, and that was 
not available for dissection. The matter is not so important in 
this genus as it would be in some others, because the characters 
seem to have no modification corresponding to the extraordinary 
female structures. On the contrary, they are extremely simple ; 
the harpes are long, moderate in width, subequal to near the tip, 
but somewhat irregular ; the tip rounded and varying a little in 
form. Oblonga seems to have no corneous clasper of any kind, 
and on this point I examined the subcarnea as well as the pcr- 
magna forms and a series from California, lest I might be misled 
by superficial resemblance. Subflava and alameda have each a 
curved corneous clasper inserted at about the outer third of the 
harpes and projecting forward. The uncus is unusually thickened 
in all the species, but there seems to be nothing different in type 
from the usual Noctuid form. 

Oblonga Grt., is the largest of the species, reddish gray in color, 
with minute black powderings, which tend to form in the male, 
a blackish shade along the median vein. The t. p. line may be 
represented by a simple or a double row of dots, or may be trace 
able as a denticulate line, the dots being the remains of the teeth. 
The ordinary spots are usually traceable as more reddish blotches 
in which the powderings are not present. Mr. Grote's original 
description was of an average male and fits that sex nicely ; in 
the female all the maculation tends to become lost and the extreme 
in that direction is permagna Grt., represented in the series be 
fore me by Californian specimens which agree closely with the 
type from Florida. The normal form is described by Dr. Kelli- 
cott, and in this the t. p. line is punctiform, the orbicular is marked 
by one and the reniform may be marked by two dark dots. 

Subjlava is distinctly yellow in tinge, and has the veins more 
or less marked with smoky or blackish ; the median vein is espe 
cially prominent, and at the end a diffuse spot tends to darken 
the vague reniform. The t. p. line is a series of venular dots and 
the terminal space is dusky in most examples. Females usuallv 
vary little except in size and in the general tinge of the ground 
color. The males are generally so different that, without a series, 



OF WASHINGTON. 315 

I could hardly have persuaded myself that the undersized luteous 
red-brown forms really belonged here. The maculation may 
become entirely lost, and only the darkening along the veins will 
remain. 

Alameda is a dull brown species in both sexes ; the veins 
darker, the row of outer spots inconspicuous and only a vague 
tracing of the ordinary spots. As a whole, both sexes are a little 
more smoky than in the male subflava; but they are of the same 
general type, and the species are related. 

Lceta is distinctly red in tint, the tendency being to yellowish 
in the interspaces and to purplish brown on the veins. There is 
no trace of an outer line and the reniform is marked only as a 
vague darker shading at the end of the cell. The sexes are simi 
lar in appearance. 

Altogether, as the species are arranged now, they are easily 
separable and should be recognized without much trouble.

Ground color a somewhat reddish gray or luteous, varying in depth and 
suggesting the flesh tint. Head and thorax immaculate. Abdomen only 
a little paler, also without maculation. Primaries with fine black powder- 
ings, which are fewer in the cell and submedian interspace, lightening this 
area, and which tend to mass along the median vein. T. a. line usually 
indicated by a blackish dot on the costa and another in the cell. T. p. line 
evenly outcurved over the cell, and continued in an even sweep about par 
allel with the outer margin. It may be a strongly dentate, nearly contin 
uous single line, a series of interspaceal followed by a series of venular 
dots, or it may be a series of venular dots only, the dots representing 
respectively the inner and outer teeth of the complete line. There is a 
series of interspaceal black terminal dots. The orbicular is a blackish 
dot surrounded by a variably evident reddish shade, or by a circular area 
free from black powderings. Reniform a blackish dot at the termination 
of the median vein, supplemented by one above it nearer to the centre of 
the eel), and surrounded by a somewhat paler shading. Secondaries a 
little paler, sometimes with a more reddish flush, with an irregular, smoky, 
inconspicuous median shade line, and with a series of terminal dots or 
lunules. Beneath paler, primaries with the disc blackish outwardly, and 
with a blackish discal spot; secondaries more powdery, with a blackish 
discal spot and a somewhat irregular, diffuse, extra median band.

The above localities are represented in the series of 17 speci 
mens now before me. It is quite probable that the species will 
be found throughout the United States wherever the food plant 
(Typka] occurs. Florida should be added to the list of localities 
given, as the type of permagna was received from that State. 
The life history of the species is given by Dr. Kellicott in Volume 
V of the Bulletin of the Buflalo Society of Natural Sciences, and 
this shows one brood only, with a hibernation in the egg stage. 

The general line of variation has been already referred to. The 
Californian examples are paler, and the secondaries have a rosy 
flush. They look different, but I have found it impossible to get 
any constant differential features. In the female the lateral in 
ferior pieces have the tip distinctly emarginate, and this feature 
is constant and characteristic of the species. 

The frontal process in this species is very long actually and in 
comparison with lhat of the other species, and it is slightly 
notched at the tip. Seen from the top the lateral margins are 
denticulate and a little flattened ; seen from the side, the inferior 
portion of the front is extended for only a short distance beneath 
the process. In the male the projection seems, on the whole, 
somewhat less prominent than in the female, but there seems also 
to be a little individual variation in this respect.

I have seen males that are very like the females in maculation, 
but darker in ground, and from that they vary to an almost uni 
form red-brown, with vague venular shadings. In the female 
there is not much variation ; there may be an addition of reddish 
to the ground color, and there is more or less difference in the 
amount of contrast along the median vein and in the terminal 
space, but on the whole there is an obvious similarity throughout 
the long series before me. The difference in size is greater than 
the record indicates, for while there are some females as small as 
any males, the average female is larger than the largest male. 
Of the 37 female examples, 27 exceed in size the largest male of 
my series. I am not aware that this species has been actually 
bred, and know of no records to that effect. The frontal process 
is absolutely and relatively shorter than in oblonga, and, seen 
from the top, the margin is broader, almost explanate, the edge 
much more finely denticulate. The tip is obtuse, entire and a 
little turned down. Seen from the side the lower half of the 
front is extended, obviously to the tip of the projection, forming 
a more perfect cone. 

In the female, the lateral pieces that bend upward from the 
lower margin have the tip rounded or obtuse, not in any way 
emarginate or excised ; and this character holds true in all the 
specimens examined by me. Ordinarily, unless the specimen 
is very fresh and has all the anal vestiture intact, the form of 
these pieces can be discerned without much trouble.

Ground color dull smoky red-brown. Head and thorax concolorous , 
immaculate. Primaries in the male dark brown; in the female lighter, 
with a somewhat yellowish tinge. No contrasting maculation in either 
sex. Veins narrowly black-marked. T. a. line obsolete in the ^; in 
the 9 ma y be entirely wanting or may be traceable for its full course as 
a narrow, smoky line, upright as a whole, outcurved in the interspaces. 
T. p. line a series of venular dots; very small black dots in the male; 
better marked, with larger dots, emphasized by white scales, in the 
female. A narrow, dusky, terminal line, followed by a pale line at the 
base of the fringes. Reniform scarcely traceable in the <J\ obscurely 
marked and yellowish centered in the $. Secondaries yellowish, with 
an obscure extra-median line in the female ; darker with a smoky tinge 
in the male. Beneath yellowish with a smoky tinge; powdery; both 
wings with an exterior dark line or shades, primaries with the disc 
blackish. 

Expanse. Male, 1.28-1.48 inches 32-37 mm. 

Female, 1.48-1.56 inches = 37-39 mm. 

Habitat. Alameda County, California, July and August; 
red No. 231 (A. Koebele). 

Type. No. 6807, U. S. National Museum. 

A series of eight examples, equally divided as to sex, is tinder 
examination, and there is a greater similarity between the sexes 
than in any previously described species. The males are as dark 
as any subflava and might even be mistaken for them except for 
the somewhat greater size and more sharply black-fined veins. 
The females range larger but not strikingly so, and they differ 
from the males chiefly in the lighter coloring throughout. The 
dotted t. p. line is greatly reduced here in both sexes, and in this 
point the species is also characteristic. In the head structure 
atameda resembles subjlava closely save that, viewed laterally, 
the front does not extend so far beneath the process and the lateral 
edges are differently serrated. So, in the character of the female 
lateral structures, the resemblance is also to subjlava; in fact the 
two species are closely related and should be found to have closely 
similar habits.

Expanse. 1.48 inches = 37 mm. 

Habitat. Hoboken, New Jersey. 

The above is the essential part of Mr. Morrison's original de 
scription, and it applies fairly well to the small series of female 
specimens that I have before me. 

Mr. Grote describes the male as follows: " Fore wings rich 
reddish brown, the veins nearly black ; they might be called 
purplish black or brown. The interspaces have a paler, some 
what yellowish tint. No lines and no discal spots. Hind wings 
reddish brown, a little paler than primaries, and paler at base. 
Body duller and lighter brown. Beneath without marks, paler ; 
disc of primaries a little blackish." 

This description is equally characteristic for both sexes, and the 
absence of all trace of transverse posterior line is characteristic. 

The specimens before me range from 38 to 40 mm., = 1.52- 
1.60 inches ; but the cf is smaller. I have seen only the example 
from Kittery Point, Maine, from the Thaxter collection. 

In the series at hand are examples from Iowa City, Iowa, July 
27 (Wickham) ; Brockport, N. Y. (Bruce) ; Wisconsin ; Louisi 
ana ; Pittsburgh, N. Y. (C. F. Hudson). 

The range indicated by these localities is great enough to fur 
nish more specimens than appear in collections ; but nothing 
seems to be known of the early stages. 

The frontal protuberance is characteristic in appearance ; 
shorter than the others, the tip notched, the lateral margins 
toothed, with ridges extending from these teeth toward the cen 
tral carina. From the side the appearance is equally character 
istic, forming a downward angle toward the base. The figures 
on Plate V will give a better idea of these structures than words of 
mine can do. The lateral pieces of the female are not so defi 
nitely bent as they are in the other species, but are rather curved 
upwar<^ toward the broad overhanging anal lobes. The tip is 
finely serrated and is notched toward its inner angle, making the 
entire structure distinctive and clearly different from that found 
in any of the other species. 

Finally, it might be suggested that collections need ^iot remain 
so poorly supplied with species of this genus. They are not 
really rare, but rather retiring in habit. They do not come to 
sugar because the tongue is probably not functional ; they fly to 
light, because we know that specimens have been so taken ; but 
they are not greatly attracted by it and the captures are acciden 
tal. Throughout the summer larvae may be found in Typha 
(cat-tails) and perhaps in other plants growing in similar locali 
ties. Careful investigation should discover the local breeding 
places, and after that the matter should be easy.

Mr. Ashmead, under the title "Some Remarks on Genera in 
the Mutillidse," showed how three families had been confused 
^with the Mutillidas by various recent authors. He exhibited a 
number of interesting forms belonging to the families Thynnida?, 
Myrmosidae, and Mutillidae, pointing out characters that easily 
separate them. He discussed Andre's classification of these in 
sects as adopted in Wytsman's " Genera Insectorum," Family 
Mutillida2. In his opinion Andre's subfamily Methocinoe was a 
very unnatural group, part belonging to the J^hynnidce and part 
to the Myrmosidce. Andre has also suppressed some good genera 
that will ultimately be recognized as valid. 

Dr. Howard, discussing Mr. Ashmead's paper, related a curi 
ous superstition in regard to Mutillidaa from the folk-lore of the 
Mississippi negroes. A dog which is cowardly and not a good 
fighter may, according to these negroes, be endowed with a 
courageous and pugnacious spirit by being made to drink from a 
decoction of boiled Mutillids, or "bull-dog ants," as they are

called. He remarked that in the Thynnidae the males are larger 
than the females, an exception to the rule obtaining among most 
insects. Other examples of insects in which the male sex is the 
larger were mentioned by other members present. 
Dr. Dyar presented the following paper : 

A REVIEW OF THE NORTH AMERICAN SPECIES OF THE 
LEPIDOPTEROUS FAMILY ANTHROCERID^E. 

By HARRISON G. DYAR. 

This group of moths has been usually known as Zygaeriida?, but 
erroneously so, as shown by Kirby. Fabricius founded the genus 
Zygcena in 1775, with 28 species included, belonging to several 
genera and families as now known, and with no indication of type. 
The first species \sfilipendulce, and if this be taken as the type, 
the usual acceptance of the term Zygasnidae is justified, and this 
becomes the name of the moths under discussion. But by the 
method of elimination we reach a different result. Scopoli, in 
1777, founded the genus Axthrocera, specifying as typejilipci2- 
dulce, the first of the Fabrician species of Zygcena. Retzius, in 
1783, proposed the genus Adscita. I have not seen the work, 
but the genus is said to have included only filipendulce and 
statices. As the species are not congeneric, and filipendulce was 
already the type of Anthrocera, statices may be considered that 
>t Adscita. Schrank, in 1801, treated the genus Zygcena, divid 
ing it into three sections. I am indebted to Prof. Fernald for ex 
amining Schrank's work for me. He tells me that section A 
contained phegcea only, section B ten species, among them fiili- 
pendulce, and section C two species, globularice Schrank (not 
Hiibner) = statices Linn, and pruni Den. & SchirT. These sec-' 
tions were not named, but if names were to be applied to them, 
B should be called Anthrocera, as it contains filipendulce, and 
C Adscita, as it contains statices. This constitutes a virtual re 
striction of Zygcena to section A, which contains only phegcea. 
Thus phegcea becomes the type of Zygcena Fab. (restr. Schrank). 
It is the second species included by him in the 28 original species. 
The above is essentially Kirby's argument. Unfortunately it 
overturns our accustomed use of the family names, since phegcea 
is a Syntomid allied to the Arctians, and thus Zygcena. is to be 
used for a high Bombycid type instead of the well known Tineid 
group with which we are accustomed to associate the name. 

The earliest plural name for the group is Hiibner's Zyga2nse 
(1806) , with filipendulce as type, but, as shown above, this name 
cannot be used. Hiibner also proposed Chrysaores (statices} and 
Glaucopes (phegcea}, but, as Chrysaor becomes a synonym of 
Adscita and Glaucopis (preoccupied in birds) of Zygcena Fab. 



OF WASHINGTON. 323 

(restr. Schr.), neither of these terms is admissible. Latreille 
used Zygaenides (1809), and Leach, Zygaenidae (1819) , neither 
being admissible. Westwood and Humphrey proposed Anthro- 
ceridae in 1857, which name should obtain. 

The American Pyromorphidae, as pointed out by Hampson and 
Packard, cannot rightly be separated as a family from the Anthro- 
ceridae. This separation was made by Smith in an effort to bring 
some order out of the jumble of forms associated under the term 
Zygaenidae by Packard and Grote, and was followed by Neu- 
moegen and Dyar, who gave as a diagnostic character the pres 
ence of but seven veins in the hind wings. But this does not hold, 
and is not of family rank in those forms that show it, since it is 
caused by the disappearance of vein 6. Comstock and Hampson 
describe this condition as produced by the coalescence of veins 
6 and 7, but I do not see any proof of this in the material before 
me. It looks rather like an obsolescence of vein 6, as takes place 
with vein 5 in other groups. This seems best shown in Tri- 
procris smithsonianus, where there is a wide space between veins 
5 and 7, with a fold in the position of vein 6, and even a slight 
irregularity in the cross-vein at its proper position of origin, though 
there is no trace of the vein itself. If it were a case of coalescence, 
I should expect to find some of our species with veins 6 and 7 
stalked, or at least approximate at origin. 

The Anthroceridae belong to the Tineoidea, as the wings have 
vein ic present. The frenulum is present, tongue well developed, 
middle spurs of hind tibiaa obsolete, antennas pectinate in our spe 
cies, the tip slightly thickened or flabellate. Vein 8 of hind wings 
is joined to the cell at outer two-thirds or end, and the upper border 
of the cell is often weak. The larvae are flattened, elliptical, with 
small retracted head, the tubercles converted into low warts, tuber 
cles i and ii, iv and v united. This type of structure is carried to 
its fullest development in the Cochlidiidae, which these larvae 
somewhat resemble. Our species fall in Kirby's subfamily An- 
throcerinas, or Hampson's Chalcosiinas.

Larva : Stage I. Gregarious. Head large, retracted under joint 2, body 
flattened, squarish, segments distinct. Single setae represent the warts. 
Those of the upper two warts (i -f- ii and iii) are stiff, black, with a clear 
bulb at the extreme base, that representing the third wart (iv + v) is soft

Stage III. Head retracted, pale, eye black, mouth brown. Cervical 
shield large, covering most of joint 2. Body squarish, thick, all pale yel 
lowish. Hair short, bristly, blackish tipped in wart i -\- ii, softer subven- 
trally; some long hairs extending over the head. With growth all the 
warts become light vinous red except those on joint 7, which are con- 
colorous, and on joint 9 where only the upper wart is red. 

Stage IV. Yellowish, cervical shield and three upper warts purple brown 
except the warts on joint 7 and the second and third on 9. which are pale 
vinous. Hair very short, stiff, but on joints 3 and 13 are some long ones. 
Feet short. Lateral and subventral regions less yellow than the dorsum. 

Stage V. Yellow to the lateral warts, the incisures greenish. Four 
rows of warts and shield black with short stiff hairs, a few long white ones 
from the ends. 

Stage VI. No change. I am not absolutely certain whether there are 
five or six stages Spiracle on joint 5 moved upward. A small area 
around the spiracles on joints 6 and n, incising the third wart of those 
segments, is white and eversible. Head strongly retracted. Hairs pointed, 
subspicular or nearly smooth with clear bulbs at the extreme base. Skin 
with fine, clear granules, not quite contiguous. Segments pigmented with 
yellow centrally, transparent in the incisures. Cervical shield and four 
rows of warts black. Five warts on joints 3 and 4. 

Described from larvae from Bell port, New York. 

Harrisina texana Stretch. 

I have referred this as a synonym of americana, but, perhaps, 
wrongly. Stretched separated his species on the presence of 
another vein (vein 8) in the fore wings. Such specimens are 
taken not only in Texas, but in New Jersey and New York, along 
with americana, and I thought it to be a case of variation. How 
ever, there are two different forms of larva in our region. Mr. 
Doll tells me that the moths from them are kt just alike," but they 
may differ in venation. The following is a description of the 
different larva. It occurs on woodbine : 

Larva : Head retracted and concealed within joint 2. Body flattened, 
sides nearly perpendicular, with a distinct substigmatal ridge. Four rows 
of low flattened areas, representing warts, granular, and bearing numer 
ous radiating short, fine bristles, and a few longer white hairs from the 
extremities. First wart subdorsal, second lateral, third substigmatal, and 
fourth obscure above the bases of the legs. The dorsum of joints 3 to 13 
is broadly bright yellow, banded between each joint with blackish, and 
again across the middle of each, including the warts, with purple brown. 
The bands all join a broad, lateral, purple brown band which runs the 
whole length, covers the subventral warts on joints 2 and 3 and the whole 
subventral region on 4 and 5. Substigmatal ridge on joints 6 to 13 white,

as are also the venter and legs, but more greenish tinted, especially just 
below the ridge. Thoracic feet brown. Head black, long, shining, the 
long antennae brownish; width, about i mm. 
Described from larvae from Boston, Mass. 

Harrisina australis Stretch. 

This form occurs in Florida and Missouri. I have it from 
Indian River and Enterprise, Florida, and Kirkwood, Missouri. 
I have referred it as a southern variety of americana, but it is, 
perhaps, referable rather to texana, if that is distinct. A series 
were bred at the Department of Agriculture in August, 1892, 
under the number 3548, received from Miss Mary Murtfeldt. 
The larva, as I see from the notes, was like the woodbine form 
described above under texana. Three of the moths are australis, 
even the front legs being partly yellow. A fourth has less yellow 
below. Another series, bred June, iSSS, under the number 158, 
from Florida, are australis as to color, but some of them have 
veins 8 and 9 of fore wings coincident as in americana. If it 
were not for the two kinds of larvae, I would not hold these three 
forms separate. The matter must be investigated further. 

Harrisina metallica Stretch. 

I have one specimen from Professor Cockerell, a male. Prof. 
Cockerell* thinks that this may be a dimorphic form of the fol- 
fowing species, but they differ markedly in the color of the collar, 
and I have both sexes of the other species. Therefore, I keep 
them separate pending further evidence. 

Harrisina coracina Clemens. 

The species is shining greenish black with black collar, shaped 
as in americana. The larva has curious transverse bands on 
certain of the segments. f I am of the opinion that neither the 
name coracina Clem, nor nigrina Graef, which has been referred 
as a synonym of it, really refer to this species, but that both of 
them refer to Gingla martcni French, I have the latter from 
Texas, but the present species only from Arizona. I await an 
opportunity to examine the type before proposing a new name 
for this form. If Prof. Cockerell is right, the name metallica 
will cover it.

Triprocris lustrans Beutenmiiller. 

Very similar to smithsonianus, but much larger and differing 
in venation. In smithsonianus, veins 8 and 9 of fore wings are 
coincident, 10 separate. In lustrans, 10 is stalked with S -f 9. 
I have a specimen that I got from Mr. Oslar, collected in Colo 
rado, and another from Tlalpam, near Mexico City, Mexico, 
from Mr. R. H. Hay. 

Triprocris constans Hy. Edwards. 

This is not before me, but is presumably referable to this genus. 

Triprocris sancta Neumoegen & Dyar. 

I have specimens from Fort Grant (Hubbard), Chiricahua Mts. 
(Hubbard), and Bright Angel, Arizona (Schwarz and Barber), 
the latter taken between June 17 and July 20. 

Triprocris desertus Hy. Edwards. 

Described as a Lycomorpha (Syntomidae) and the types are 
lost. I include the name only so as not to lose sight of it pend 
ing the discovery of more specimens.

The species occurs in dry oak woods in the Eastern States. 
The larva feeds on dead leaves under which it lives. I have de 
scribed it.* 

Pyromorpha centralis Walker. 

No specimen is before me, the record as North American being- 
made doubtfully from a specimen which Dr. Barnes has, said to 
come from Florida. The species is Mexican.

I have this form from Texas and Arizona. The larva is un 
known. The earliest name will probably prove to be coracina, 
as I state above. The moths have veins 8 and 9 of fore wings 
shortly stalked. 

Gingla fusca Hy. Edwards. 

I have but one specimen. It has veins 8 and 9 of fore wings 
separate, but approximate at base.

NOTES ON THE ORTHOPTERA OF BERMUDA WITH THE 
DESCRIPTION OF A NEW SPECIES. 

By A. N. CAUDEI.L. 

This article is the result of a perusal of that portion of Prof. 
Verrill's recent workf treating of the Orthoptera of Bermuda. 

* Psyche, vin. p. 128, 1897. 

t " The Bermuda Islands, an Account of their Scenery, &c.," Svo, New 
Haven, 1902.

It is to be regretted that the latter was not submitted in manu 
script for approval to a specialist, as was evidently done in certain 
other orders. The nomenclature is not recent, and at least two 
recorded species are omitted. The following notes are submitted 
as corrections and additions to Prof. Verrill's article : 

Stenobothrus maculipennis Scudder. 

This species belongs to the genus Orphulella, and is a synonym 
of 0. pelidna Burm. 

Stenobothrus bilineatus Scudder. 

This species is also a member of the genus Orphulella, and is 
synonymous with O. speciosa Scudd. 

Orphulella olivaceus Morse. 

This species is not mentioned in Prof. Verrill's work, but is 
recorded as occurring in Bermuda by Prof. Scudder.* 

Schistocerca americana Drury. 

This handsome insect has apparently never been recorded from 
the islands, and Prof. Verrill seems not to have met with it. The 
National Museum contains two female specimens bearing the 
label " Bermuda I," but no collector or date. This appears to 
be the only representative of the Acridiinae thus far taken on the 
islands. 

Conocephalus dissimilis Serville. 

This is a synonym of C. triops Linnaeus. 

Conocephalus fuscostriatus Redtenbacher. 

This species has been recorded by Prof. Scudder, f as having 
been taken on the islands by C. M. Weed. 

Orchelimum vulgare Harris. 

This species appears in Scudder's Catalogue as a synonym of 
O. agile DeG. 

Gryllus bermudensis, n. sp. 

General color testaceous with lighter markings. Head moderatelj' 
prominent, as wide as the thorax; eyes piceous, and a similarly colored 
band across the occiput. From each end of this transverse bar a fuscous 
stripe extends back to the posterior border of the head. The sides of the 
head and the greater portion of the face is light yellowish. Thorax one and 
one-half times as broad as long, light testaceous with quite uniform infusca- 
tion on each side of the center above and on the posterior portion of the 
upper half of the lateral lobes, which are strongly inflexed posteriorly. 
This inflexion of the posterior portion of the lateral lobes and the infusca- 
tion of the upper part seems quite constant, being present in the immature 
specimens as well as in the adult. Elytra not quite reaching the tip of

the abdomen, testaceous, the veins of the lateral field and the dividing 
vein lighter. Wings of the same length as the tegmina. Abdomen almost 
black, cerci lighter. Ovipositor piceous, longer than the posterior femora. 
Legs testaceous, immaculate. 

Length, exclusive of the ovipositor, 22 mm.; pronotum, 5 mm.; pos 
terior femora, 14 mm. ; ovipositor, 16 mm. ; width of thorax, 7.5 mm. 

One female, adult; two males, immature. 

Type. No. 6819, U. S. National Museum. 

These specimens bear only the locality label. The species 
seems somewhat allied to G. pcrsonatus Uhl., but the color is 
much darker and the lateral lobes are more strongly inflexed pos 
teriorly. The markings also are somewhat different. It is also 
allied to G. domesticus Linn., but it is decidedly larger and darker 
than any specimen of that species that I have seen. 

Prof. Sctidder* mentions a species of Gryllus, taken by Weed 
in Bermuda, as presumably new ; but it has never been described 
and may be the one here described, or it may be either G. abbre- 
viatus or pennsylvanicus. 

Periplaneta americana Linnasus. 

Prof. Yen-ill's figure 198 is certainly not that of this species, as 
both sexes of americana have the wings extending beyond the 
tip of the abdomen. 

Stylopyga orientalis Linnaeus. 

This species belongs to the genus Blatta, of which it is the 
type. 

Panchlora surinamensis Linnaeus. 

This belongs to and is the type of Brunner's genus Leucophaa. 

Panchlora maderae Olivier. 

This species has been removed from Panchlora by Dr. Krauss, 
and forms the type of his genus Rhyparobia. 

Ectobia germanica Linna3iis. 

This belongs to my recently established genus BlatteUa\, which 
replaces the preoccupied genus Phyllodromia of Serville. Ger 
manica is the type of the genus.

tracha I describe here is the most wonderful form known till 
now, standing quite alone in the genus. 

Tetracha (Phseoxantha) klugi Chd. 

One specimen only. Attracted by the light in the tent at Ciu- 
dad Bolivar in early June. 

Tetracha (Phaeoxantha) aequinoctialis Dej. 

This very active beetle, whose ground color is like the sand 
upon which it is found, was taken along the margin of a stream 
near Ciudad Bolivar during May, June, and November. The 
elytra are less punctured than in the Amazonian specimens, and 
the vertex is yellow-brown. I cannot distinguish this species 
from T. bifasciata Brll., which I consider but a variety of the 
former. 

Tetracha klagesi, sp. nov. 

Species mirabilis valde singularis, novam sectionem in genere consti- 
tuens ! 

Tetr, oxychtloidi m. paullulum affinis, valde major tota cjanea ; pectoris

bus, sed brevioribus quam in Phaeoxanthse specibus, articulis 4 primis 
nigris. Prothorace longiore angustioreque quam in Ph. cequznoctiali 
Dej., angulis anticis paullo minus productis, sulcis pronotalibus profun-

i 9 , c?c?. This regal species occurs in the Parima Mountains, 
and was discovered running along the borders of a small stream 
at dusk. It runs in a zigzag course with marvelous rapidity 
exceeding that of its nearest kin and makes its appearance only 
after sunset. Found in May and early June at an elevation of

2,500 to 3,000 feet. It gives me great pleasure to dedicate this 
beautiful beetle to my friend Mr. Klages, especially as the hard 
ships resulting from the trip to its habitat nearly cost his life, and 
it is the best of the few things taken there. 

Tetracha lacordairei Gory. 

One specimen taken while digging in a cornfield near Ciudad 
Bolivar about the middle of June. 

Tetracha affinis Dej., var. smaragdina "Thins. 

Found on sandy roads quite distant from any water. At Ciu 
dad Bolivar during June and July, and at Suapure in May and 

Juiyi 

Tetracha sobrina Dej., var. sommeri Chd. 

Found in damp places along the margin of a stream near Ciu 
dad Bolivar in May and June. 

This species is one of the most variable of the genus ! Only 
" geniculata Chev." and " ignea Bat." are now noted in the cata 
logues as varieties of Tetr. sobrina Dej. ; but after a careful study 
of the relationships of the " closely allied" forms, I now believe 
that the following are but varieties of the same species : 

Tetr. sobrina Dej. subspecies punctata Cast. 
" confusa Chaud. 

" infuscata Mann. 

longipennis Chaud. 

As regards T. Chevrolati Chaud., it is quite distinct from 
subsp. infuscata Mann, and belongs to the varieties of T. Caro 
lina L., as does subsp. chiliensis Brll. and var. Latreillei Cast., 
var. splcndida Dokht, etc. 

Tetracha mellyi Chaud.* 

Found on the dry, sandy borders of a stream near Ciudad Boli 
var during May and June, and occasionally came in to the light. 
Some of the latter show a coppery coloration somewhat like in 
T. fulgida King, and have the last two abdominal segments 
with the border of the preceding two yellow. The sixth ventral 
segment is emarginate in the d\ but the emargination is not 
rounded in front as it is in the commoner variation, which also 
differs in having the last four ventral segments pale yellow. 

Cicindela suturalis F., var. helvaea Klug. 

A very active species found during the hottest hours of the day 
along the sandv margin of a stream near Ciudad Bolivar from 
March to the middle of June. 



* I am not quite sure if this form is really only one of the varieties of 
T. fulgida Klug. In regard to the sculpture of the elytra, it may prove to 
be a separate species. 



334 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

Cicindela argentata F. 

Found in the jungle, and occasionally flew in to the light at 
night during May, June, July, August, November, and December 
at Ciudad Bolivar. 

Cicindela argentata F., var. pallipes Fet. 

A single specimen came in to the light in early June near Ciu 
dad Bolivar. 

Cicindela affinis W. Horn. 

One specimen was taken at light near Ciudad Bolivar in early 
June, but a number were found on the clayey bank of the river at 
Suapure during June and July. 

Prepusa ventralis Dej. 

This came in to the light near Ciudad Bolivar in early June. 
It is likely an inhabitant of the jungle. 

Pentacomia egregria Chaud. 

One specimen taken at midday on a clayey bank a fourth of a 
mile from the forest at Suapure in June. 

Odontochila cayennensis F. 

Found at Suapure in March, April, May, June, and Decem 
ber ; also in the Parima Mountains up to 3,000 feet. 

Odontochila confusa Dej. 
Suapure, May and June. 

Odontochila margineguttata Dej. 

Suapure, March, April, May, June, August, and December. 
O. rugatula Bat., described as a distinct species from the Ama 
zons, is but a slight variation of it. 

Odontochila lacordairei Gory. 

Suapure, April, May, June, and November, 

All the species of Odontochila were found running about in 
the shade of the virgin forest where there was but little under 
growth. Their habits are quite similar, excepting that cayen 
nensis F. would occasionally, upon being disturbed, seek tempo 
rary refuge by flying onto foliage, but never more than a few feet 
above ground. The several species are quite wary and, on ac 
count of their dark colors, are not conspicuous objects among the 
dead leaves which carpet the ground throughout the forest, out 
side of which none of these species were ever met with.
