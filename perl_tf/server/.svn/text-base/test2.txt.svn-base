ORGANIZATION. 



In response to a circular call, of which the following is a copy, 
a number of persons interested in entomology met at 1700 Thir 
teenth st., N.W., Washington, D. C., on Friday evening, February 
29, 1884 : 

( Copy of Call. ) 

Entomology is now so well represented at the national capital 
that some organization of those persons interested in it seems de 
sirable, both on social and scientific grounds. The undersigned, 
voicing what we believe, after considerable inquiry, to be the 
general desire of all those in any way interested in insects, both 
in Washington and Baltimore, hereby invite you to an informal 
meeting at the residence of Prof. C. V. Riley, 1700 Thirteenth 
st., N.W., on Friday evening (February 29), at 7.30 P. M. 

At this meeting it is proposed to discuss, informally, the ad 
visability of forming such an organization, and, if the general 
sentiment prove favorable, to provide for permanent organization 
at a subsequent meeting to be then and there decided upon. 

You are earnestly invited to attend, or, if unable to do so by 
reason of prior engagement, to address either of the undersigned 
by letter, giving your views on the subject : 

C. V. RILEY, 
E. A. SCHWARZ, 
L. O. HOWARD. 

After a thorough discussion the following resolution of organ 
ization was unanimously adopted : 

" Whereas, an Entomological Society is demanded at Washington, we. 
as persons interested in entomology, do herewith constitute ourselves an 
organization for the purpose of cooperation to advance, encourage, and 



enjoy pure and economic entomology and the social relations called for 
by our mutual interests." 

A committee was appointed to draw up a constitution and to 
call a second meeting immediately on its completion. This 
second meeting took place at the residence of Dr. C. V. Riley, 
on Wednesday evening, March 12, 1884. The Constitution 
which follows was adopted.

PROCEEDINGS. 



APRIL 3, 1884. 

Fourteen persons present. President Riley in the chair. 

A letter from Professor Baird was read granting the use of the 
council-room of the U.S. National Museum for the meetings of 
the Society. 

Mr. Schwarz exhibited specimens of ^uedius vernix Lee. and 
Q. ferox Lee. and called attention to a character, hitherto over 
looked, of these two species, viz : the presence of an onychial 
seta, which is simple in the latter and double in the former 
species. 

Dr. Barnard remarked on the hibernation of the Elm-tree 
Leaf-beetle ( Galeruca xanthomelcena} on the grounds of the 
Agricultural Department, great numbers of the beetle having 
sought shelter in the crevices of telegraph poles near the infested 
trees. Under these circumstances he advocates the killing of the 
beetles in winter time. 

Prof. Riley read a short communication by Mr. Fred Gates, of 
England, relating to an incident of the early life of the late 
Prof. Townend Glover. Mr. Dodge promised to give at some 
future meeting some other communications on the life of Prof. 
Glover. 

Mr. Murdoch read a paper, of which the following is an 
abstract : 

INSECT-COLLECTING AT POINT BARROW, ARCTIC ALASKA. Much could 
not be done in the way of collecting insects, as the snow did not melt till 
the middle of June, and freezing began pretty permanently by Sept. ist. 
Besides, the time of the party was occupied by other observations of all sorts, 
and insect-collecting could only be followed incidentally. The country is a 
tolerably level marshy plain, interspersed with innumerable lakes and 
small ponds, and scantily covered with grass and flowering plants. A 
complete beetle was found in the stomach of a newly-arrived Lapland 
Longspur on May 2oth, and a hairy caterpillar was found crawling on the 
snow May 23d. Flies resembling the common house-fly were also seen 
crawling on the snow at the same date. Dipterous larvse were also very 



10 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

abundant in the pools early in June, and the gnats left the pupa stage and 
rose from the surface of the pools in the middle of June. A warm calm day 
alwavs brought out considerable swarms of mosquitoes, but the summers 
of both 1882 and 1883 were cold and the mosquitoes were more trouble 
some/ Beetles were collected crawling on the dry sunny spots, and the 
pools in early summer swarmed with small black Podurids resembling 
grains of gunpowder. Peculiar brown carrion-flies, resembling bird-para 
sites, were very numerous around the dead bodies at the native cemetery. 
Insects were seldom seen flying, but were occasionally to be met with 
along the sunny bank of one lagoon, especially crane-flies, and a few large 
humble-bees. A few moths were hatched from cocoons picked up on the 
tundra, but only one was seen flying in the two seasons we were at the 
station. 

In connection with Mr. Murdoch's communication, Dr. Barnard 
remarked on the food of Poduridae which he had observed feeding 
on the remains of dead clams in Louisiana; Dr. Riley on an in 
teresting, not yet determined, Dipteron found around the Esqui 
maux burying-grounds by Mr. Murdoch ; Mr. Schwarz on 
the Coleoptera, and Mr. Marx on the spiders collected by Mr. 
Murdoch. 

Mr. Howard read a communication on the so-called Mistaken 
Parasite, Platygaster error Fitch. He showed how this species 
had been connected with a series of mistakes from the time of its 
original description, mainly from the fact that the characters given 
by Fitch were not specific. He called attention to the improba 
bility of the reported observations of Herrick'and Cook on the 
oviposition of this species in the eggs of Cecidomyia destructor, 
and, in closing, exhibited specimens of an allied species of the 
genus Telenomus bred from eggs of Chrysopa. 

Mr. Schwarz read a paper on the insect fauna of the District 
of Columbia. He calls attention to the complexity of the faunal 
regions of North America as compared with the simplicity of the 
palearctic fauna. As to the fauna of the Atlantic slope, the num 
ber of subdivisions formerly adopted have been gradually reduced 
to three the boreal fauna, that of the Northern and that of the 
Southern States. The fauna of the District comes, of course, 
very close to the dividing zone between the two last-mentioned 
regions, but must, in his opinion, still be attributed to the Southern 
fauna. The topographical features of the District are exceptionally 
favorable for harboring a very rich insect fauna, and every one who 
has paid any attention to the collecting of insects in the vicinity of 



OF WASHINGTON. 11 

Washington must be struck with the great number of species 
occurring within that limited area. Mr. Schwarz finally urged 
that it should be one of the duties of this Society to collect and 
compile materials for an insect fauna of the District, a work that 
would be facilitated by the large collections that have already been 
made in the District, and a part of which has already been put on 
record in the literature. 



JUNE 5, 1884. 

Twelve persons present. Vice-President Marx in the chair. 

Mr. Stewart exhibited a number (32) of parasites which he 
found dead within a pupa of Ant her ce a cvnthia, Mr. Howard 
identified the parasite as Smicra nmricz. 

Mr. Stewart further remarked on a trilobed gall he observed on 
Elm leaves, and. Mr. Pergande thinks it referable to the Cocks 
comb Elm-leaf Gall produced by Colopha iilmicola. 

Mr. Stewart also mentions the issuance of an undetermined 
parasitic larva from the imago of a Dragon-Fly ( Odonatd) . 

Mr. Schwarz exhibited specimens of a beautiful and undescribed 
species of Orchestes* and of Apion ivahhii which he found 
infesting Bctnla nigra in the vicinity of Washington. The 
larva of the former species has not yet been found, but larvae of 
the Apion were exhibited infesting the catkins of the birch. 

Mr. Pergande exhibited a collection of European Hymenoptera 
representing types of genera and which he had just received from 
Dr. Schmiedeknecht. of Germany. 

J 

Mr. Howard exhibited specimens of Inostemma boscii ( ?) 
and gave a short history of the theories concerning the curious 
thoracic appendage, arriving at the conclusion that it is a second 
ary sexual character. 

Mr. Howard also exhibited specimens of a new species of 
Schizaspidia, collected in Florida by Mr. Schwarz, and which 
were also furnished with remarkable thoracic prolongations. 

Mr. Schwarz exhibited specimens of Eleusis pallida (family 
Staphvlinidas) and Ino immunda (family Cucujtdtz), remarking 



* Since described by Dr. Horn as O. betuleti. 



12 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

that the extraordinary resemblance between these two insects of 
two quite different families must be a purely accidental one, 
having no connection whatever with mimicry. 

Dr. Barnard exhibited a specimen of Harpalus pensylvanicus 
infested by a Hair-worm, and remarked upon the structural char 
acters, the development and habits of Gordius and Mermis. 
He also mentioned the fact that Mermis acuminata has been 
found in the Apple-worm (larva of Carpocapsa pomonella), and 
in explanation of this fact he proposed the theory that immature 
larva? from fallen fruit returning to the tree get attacked while 
thus on the ground, and ascend to enter other fruit thereafter on the 
tree, and that this will account for the cases observed. 

Mr. Marx read a paper on the geographical distribution of 
Arachnida in North America, going through the natural families of 
the Order, and dwelling upon the peculiarities exhibited by each 
family in connection with the geographical range. 

Mr. Marx offered some remarks on the mode of respiration in 
Epeira sylvatica as observed in a living specimen which he had 
received from Ft. Stevenson, Dakota. The pneumatic stigmata 
were found to open and close alternately at regular intervals, 
whereas the hitherto accepted theory was that the stigmata lead 
ing to the lungs were constantly open and prevented from being 
closed by the horny ring, or bulla, surrounding the aperture. 

Mr. Marx read some biological notes on Latrodectus mactans, 
especially on its mode of capturing insects by means of a sticky 
fluid exuded from the spinnerets. The variability in general 
appearance, coloration and markings exhibited in this species in 
its different molts is really wonderful, and the following specific 
names must be considered as synonyms: L. perfidus Walk., 
variolus Wa\k.,formidafo7is Walk, and intersector Fabr. 

Mr. Howard stated that the collection of Lepidoptera of Mr. 
Mead had been purchased by the Rev. Mr. Holland, of Pittsburg, 
Pa. 



OCTOBER 2, 1884. 

Six members present. Vice-President Marx in the chair. 
Lieutenant Casey remarked upon, and illustrated by drawing, 
a monstrosity observed in a Longicorn beetle of the genus 



OF WASHINGTON. 13 

Acmceops. The left front leg has three tarsi, the two addi 
tional ones originating, not as is usual in such cases from the 
tip of the tibia, but from the tip of the first joint of the regular 
tarsus. 

Mr. Schwarz exhibited a specimen of a rare Curculionid, 
Hilipus squamosus, found in southern Georgia. 

Mr. Howard mentioned a curious instance of irregular develop 
ment of the wings in a Chalcid. The specimen described is in 
the collection of Dr. Riley. and is a female of Isosoma tritici. 
The fore-wings are represented by mere rudimentary pads, while 
the hind-wings are fully developed. The rule in this species is 
no wing development whatever, but occasionally a fully winged 
specimen occurs. 



NOVEMBER 6, 1884. 

Ten members present. President Riley in the chair. 

Mr. Hubbard read a paper on the habits of Hypotrichia 
spissipes as observed by him at Crescent City, Florida. He 
exhibited a specimen of this rare Lamellicorn beetle which had 
impaled itself upon a spear of grass, and called attention to the 
thinly chitinized structure of the male which rendered it liable 
to such accidents. The rapid flight of the male and its habit of 
seeking out the female by burro w r ing into the sand was noted. 
Mr. Hubbard then remarked upon the sexual differences in this 
and the allied genus Plectrodes, and pointed out the close rela 
tionship of both forms with Pleocoma. a genus which has been 
placed by LeConte among the Scarabasidag pleurosticti. 

Mr. Hubbard made a communication on the life-history of 
Mallodon melanopus and the dwarfing of oaks caused by the 
larva of this large Cerambycid. The larva lives in Florida in 
the roots of highland varieties of the Live Oak (Quercus 
virens) and forms a sort of root-gall, reducing the tree to a clus 
ter of shoots. The insect being common throughout Florida, 
large tracts of land which might become forest thus remain bar 
ren oak shrub in consequence of its attacks. 

Dr. Riley remarked that his own and Mr. Geo. Noble's obser 
vations in the vicinity of Savannah. Ga., had corroborated Mr. 
Hubbard's experience. 



14 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

Mr. Mann commented on the extensiveness and variety of the 
literature of science as a whole, and the impossibility of obtain 
ing a knowledge of the literature relating to special departments 
of research without the aid of summaries or indices prepared for 
the purpose. He then dwelt upon the multitude of separate 
partial indices now in existence, upon the difficulties experienced 
in making use of these indices, and the waste of labor expended 
in disconnected attempts to obviate these difficulties. He ad 
verted to the advantage which would accrue to all students 
through co-operative effort to obviate the difficulties described, 
and remarked upon the necessity, in case such co-operation is to 
take place, of determining upon a system of carrying it out. He 
concluded with remarks on the appropriateness of the execution 
of a plan of co-operation in connection with the work of the 
Division of Entomology in the U. S. Department of Agriculture. 

Mr. Schwarz read a paper on the changes that take place in 
the imago state of Coleoptera. After briefly referring to the 
changes brought about by the inclemency of the weather, old 
age and other external influences, he explained the general differ 
ences between the immature and mature imago, and more par 
ticularly such differences of a more structural character. These 
are the loss of the front tarsi in certain coprophagous Scarabseidse 
and the loss of the mandibular appendages in the family 
Otiorhynchidae. As a third instance of such changes Mr. 
Schwarz exhibited immature specimens of Mezium americanuui. 
which are all covered with rows of very conspicuous clavate 
bristles, whereas in the mature specimens these bristles are so 
completely lost on the elytra that even their points of insertion 
cannot longer be observed. 

A discussion on the habits of Mezium followed. Dr. Riley 
stated that he had found it in old hay. Mr. Hubbard mentioned 
finding it in immense numbers in a rat's nest, and Mr. Pergande 
stated that he had commonly bred the allied Ptinus brunneus 
from rat's clung. 

Dr. Riley made some remarks on the collection of insects 
made at Point Barrow, Alaska, by Prof. John Murdoch,* calling 
attention to the fact that, as with other collections from arctic re 
gions, a large percentage of the species was common to both 

* Vide p. 9. 



OF WASHINGTON. 15 

America and Europe. The species were just such as would be 
expected from a country characterized by low herbage, with the 
exception of Urocerus Jlavicornis, which had doubtless been 
introduced in timber. 

Dr. Riley made some remarks on the phytophagic habits of the 
genus Isosoma, instancing further corroborative proof thereof as 
shown by the habits of a new species which he described as /. 
grande. and in which he had been able to examine the female in 
the act of ovipositing. 

Dr. Riley gave a description of a new species of Acrobasis 
(A. vaccinii} which, in the larva state, is the well-known 
'Cranberry Fruit-worm," hitherto unknown in the imago state. 

He criticised the conclusions recently assumed in the Bulletin 
of the Brooklyn Entomological Societv as to the lignivorous 
habits of Rhyssa lunator* giving his own experience to show that 
it is parasitic. 

Dr. Riley also criticised a recent report in Psyche of Mr. 
Lugger's statement in reference to the habit of Tiphia and 
Rhipiphorus as found upon Lachnosterna fusca* stating that 
the account of the oviposition of both species was manifestly 
incorrect. 



DECEMBER n, 1884. 

Ten members present. President Riley in the chair. 

Mr. H. G. Hubbard was elected a member of the Society. 

Mr. Stewart exhibited a large number of insects collected at 
the electric light, on the dome of the Capitol. Mr. Schwarz 
remarked that among the insects thus collected, there were many 
hitherto not known to be attracted by light. Prof. Riley also 
spoke upon the collection, and Prof. Riley remarked that he was 
called upon the latter part of September by the architect of the 
Capitol, Mr. Edward Clark, for advice as to the disfigurement of 
the buildings, which had been cleaned at great expense during the 
summer. He found that the hosts of small soft-bodied Dipterous 
and Neuropterous insects, attracted by the electric light, had made 
the building a paradise for spiders, which, by their webs and the 
carcasses of their victims, had sadly disfigured the building. He 



16 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

advised the non-use of electric light during August, September 
and October. 

Prof. Riley also presented a list, prepared by Mr. Marx, of the 
species of Arachnida thus found, and stated that most of them 
were probably aerial species, i. <?., species having gossamer habits. 
Mr. Marx added some remarks on these spiders and on the fami 
lies in which gossamer habits have been observed. 
o Mr. Hubbard read a paper on the discovery of a species of An- 
ophthalmus in Luray Caverns, Virginia. The only specimen ob 
served was found in the immediate vicinity of an electric light about 
half a mile from the entrance of the cave and proved to be identical 
with A. tenuis, which was hitherto known only from Erhard 
Cave in Montgomery Co.. Virginia, at least 140 miles distant 
from Luray. Mr. Hubbard added some remarks upon the geo 
graphical distribution of the North American species of Anoph- 
thalmus, there being only one known from Virginia, five from 
Kentucky, and two from Indiana ; further, on their mode of living 
and the mode of collecting them. 

Mr. Schwarz spoke on parasitic Coleoptera, enumerating the 
different modes of parasitism known to occur in that Order. He 
mentioned (i) species known to be parasitic only in the imago 
state, as exemplified by the genera Platypsyllus, Leptinus and 
Amblyopinus ; (2) genuine parasites, as exemplified by the 
family StylopidaB and the genus Rhipidius ; (3) the Meloidce and 
most of the Rhipiphoridce, which present in the larva state a 
much less pronounced parasitism ; (4) some isolated cases still 
more leaning toward predaceous habits, as exemplified by the 
genus Trichodes and by Brachytarsus scabrosus. 

Dr. Riley said that he missed Aleochara ant homy ice in the 
enumeration of parasitic Coleoptera, and thinks that its parasitic 
nature is well established by Mr. Sprague's observations. Mr. 
Schwarz replied that from analogy with the known habits of 
other Aleocharinre he considers this Aleochara to be merely a 
predaceous species. 

A discussion on the terms commensalism and parasitism fol 
lowed. 

Mr. Hubbard mentioned in this connection the probable occur 
rence of Platypsyllus castoris in the Lake Superior region as 
reported -by beaver hunters.

Ten persons present. President Riley in the chair. 

The election of officers then took place, and the officers of the 
Society for the year 1884 were re-elected for the year 1885. 

Dr. Riley exhibited a specimen of the larva of the Dipterous 
genus Scenopinus found by Dr. E. Bessels infesting the blanket of a 
Navajo Indian. He related the history of Scenopinus pallipes 
as observed by Mr. Sanborn and remarked upon the species of 
the genus hitherto observed in the United States. Mr. Schwarz 
pointed out the great external resemblance of this larva to that 
of the Coleopterous genus' Cardiophorus. 

Dr. Marx reported the discovery of the male of the Arachnid 
genus Gasteracantha by Mr. H. G. Hubbard, of Crescent City, 
Florida. 



MARCH 12, 1885. 

Eight persons present. Vice-President Morris in the chair. 

The Corresponding Secretary read a letter from Mr. Lawrence 
Johnson, of Gainesville, Florida, in relation to a number of 
insects observed in Florida injurious to vegetation, among them 
more especially a Pyralid larva injuring Paw-paw (Asimina}. 

Mr. Mann offered some remarks on the advisability of exact 
transcription of titles in making references to publications, as 
otherwise such works often could not be identified with certainty 
by the titles quoted. 

Mr. Schwarz exhibited twigs of Sumac {Rhus glabra) in

consimilis, and remarked upon the work of this species. 

The President then delivered his annual address : 

ANNUAL ADDRESS OF THE PRESIDENT. 

FELLOW-MEMBERS : Your president has experienced some dif 
ficulty in choosing a subject upon which to address you as required 
by our constitution. Our Society is too young for retrospect, 
while a review of entomological events of a general char 
acter is in a measure forestalled by the various publications de 
voted to our science and by the English and German Zoological 
2

Records. Some of the incidents of the year, so far as North 
America are concerned, are also recorded in my annual report 
as U. S. Entomologist. Yet it may be interesting to briefly re 
fer to a few facts that have characterized the year just closed and 
that are sufficiently interesting to warrant comment. 

On May zoth, Prof. A. J. Cook sent me some Noctuid larvae about 
one-third grown, which were appearing in vast bodies, like the 
Army Worm, in parts of Michigan. While resembling most the 
darker forms of the larva of Laphygma frugiperda Sm. & 
Abb., they yet differed and did not fully correspond with any of 
the numerous Noctuid larva? known to me. The species subse 
quently, upon being reared to the imago by Prof. Cook, proved 
to be Agrotis fennica Treitschke, and, as subsequent reports 
showed, w^as abundant and destructive over a wide area and par 
ticularly in the Ottawa district in Canada. The larval history 
of the species had not previously been known ; neither had the 
species been counted as among our injurious insects. It is widely 
distributed, occurring in all parts of the Northern $tates ant | on 
the Pacific. The worm first appeared in April, and the destruc 
tive brood in May was probably a second brood. Prof. Cook 
gives a good account of it with very poor figures in his u Notes 
from the Entomological Laboratory of the Michigan Agricultural 
College," published independently and without date. It seems 
to be a general feeder, though affecting principally grass, clover 
and strawberries. 

Almost every year some species scarcely heard of before thus 
becomes conspicuous, and this sudden and wide-spread appearance 
of a species not previously noticeable is one of the most interesting 
phenomena presented for our consideration, and I have discussed 
it in a paper on " New Insects Injurious to Agriculture," read at 
the Cincinnati meeting of the A. A. A. S. in 1881, part of the 
abstract of which is in these words : 

" These new destructive species may either be (i) recently in 
troduced species from some foreign country, (2) native species 
hitherto unobserved or unrecorded, and new in the sense of not be 
ing described, or (3) native species well known to entomologists, 
but not previously recorded as injurious. 

" The author argues that in the last two categories, more par 
ticularly, we frequently have to deal with newly-acquired habits, 



OF WASHINGTON. 19 

and in the second category with newly-acquired characters that in 
many cases systematists would consider of specific value. In 
short, he believes that certain individuals of a species, which has 
hitherto fed in obscurity on some wild plant, may take to feeding 
on a cultivated plant, and with the change of habit undergo in 
the course of a few years a sufficient change of character to be 
counted a new species. Increasing and spreading at the rapid 
rate which the prolificacy of most insects permits, the species 
finally becomes a pest, and necessarily attracts the attention of the 
farmer. The presumption is that it could not at any previous 
time have done similar injury without attracting similar attention ; 
in fact, that the habit is newly acquired. The author reasons that 
just as variation in plant life is often sudden, as in the ' sport,' 
and that new characters which may be perpetuated are thus 
created, so in insects there are comparatively sudden changes 
which, under favoring conditions, are perpetuated. In this way 
characters which most systematists would consider as specific, 
originate within periods that are very brief compared to those 
which evolutionists believe to be necessary for the differentiation 
of specific forms among the higher animals." 

The cut- worms seem to have been unusually abundant during 
the spring of 1884, and one species, viz., Hadena devastatrix 
Brace, common to both Europe and America, attracted a great 
deal of attention and did much injury in Manitoba. 

Another insect which deserves particular mention is Nematus 
erichsonii. This was first ascertained to be the cause of the 
death of the Larch, or Hackmatack, in Maine and other parts of 
New England, during the year 1883, when I had the Opportunity 
of witnessing, in company with Dr. Packard, the wide-spread 
devastation which it had caused. It was fully reported on by Dr. 
Packard in the annual report of the U. S. Entomologist for 1883, 
and has, during the past year, been observed doing similar injury 
to Larch in parts of Canada. 

The Clover Leaf-beetle (Phytonomus punctatus} also attracted 
unusual attention in 1884 and was said, at the meeting of the 
Entomological Club of the A. A. A. S., to have attacked beans. 
It has also been reported as quite abundant in parts of Ontario, 
and the beetle was found in countless numbers on the western 
shore of Lake Erie. Nothing further as to its life habits has 



'20 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

been added to that published by me in 1881, but its occurrence 
in such numbers, and over so large an extent of country, so soon 
after its first injuries were reported, presents abundant cause for 
reflection and would indicate that the species is rapidly extending 
its range, especially westward. 

Another species of the same genus, namely, P. nigrirostris, 
has been found in Canada by Mr. Jas. Fletcher, of Ottawa, also 
feeding upon clover. 

Pztlvinaria innumerabilis was unusually abundant in 1884 in 
all parts of the country. There is need of very careful study of 
the forms found upon so many different trees, forms which, on 
account of their general resemblance, are looked upon as being 
one and the same species. So far as experiments go, some which 
I made some 12 years since at Kirkwood, Mo., by transferring 
the young from one plant to another, prove, so far as such evi 
dence is proof, that the species found upon Oak, Maple and 
Grape-vine are the same ; but where such evidence is wanting, 
we must study not only the young and the males but the struc 
tural characteristics, especially those of the anal plate in the 
females, before we can feel assured that we have to deal with but 
one species. 

That cosmopolitan butterfly Pyrameis cardui attracted con 
siderable attention during the year, feeding upon our nettles and 
thistles. I refer to it, however, chiefly because of its migrations, 
notices of which have been abundant in European journals. The 
fact of the extended migration of butterflies has only recently 
come to be fully appreciated. I have discussed these butterfly 
migrations, so far as our Danais archippus is concerned, in an 
article in the Scientific American for April 6th, 1878, entitled 
" The Migration of Butterflies," and shown that there is a very 
general southward movement, accompanied by congregation and 
concentration, from the extreme northwestern portion of the 
country to the Gulf States in autumn, and a return migration and 
dispersion the ensuing spring and summer. 

It is a noteworthy fact that migrating butterflies have a wide range. 
That Pyrameis cardui flies in vast numbers over large stretches 
of the European Continent and across the Channel to the British 
Isles is a well-established fact, and the migratory tendencies have 
their explanation, in all probability, in the same promoting 



OF WASHINGTON. 21 

causes as those of our Rocky Mountain locust, i. ., chiefly ex 
cessive multiplication and want of fresh food. Throughout 
southern Europe, or at least large proportions of it, the month of 
July is apt to be excessively dry. I witnessed last year, early in 
July, in South France, a phenomenal occurrence of this butter 
fly. Its larvae had absolutely devoured all the thistles and even 
the cultivated artichokes in those portions of the Midi which I 
visited, and I saw as many as 30 chrysalides upon a single grape- 
leaf in a vineyard adjacent to a railroad. The butterflies were 
excessively numerous along the lines of the different railroads, 
seeking in vain for fresh plants upon which to lay their eggs, and 
it is no wonder that under such circumstances they congregate in 
increasing numbers and finally rise in the air and travel such 
long distances, guided by the prevailing winds. What is true of 
this particular species is likewise applicable to some of the Yel 
lows (genus Colias} . I shall never forget an experience on the 
morning of July zd in training from Montpellier northward. As 
the train swept along it stirred up for many miles a continuous 
cloud of brown, yellow, and white butterflies, consisting chiefly 
of the species just mentioned and the common Pieris rapce. In 
reference to this last species it may perhaps be well to mention 
the successful introduction, here at Washington, of one of its 
chief parasites, the Apanteles glomeratus. 

Osten Sacken has recently called attention, in the Wiener 
Entomologische Zeitung, to the fact that P. J. Stepanoff has 
published in Russian (Proc. of the Nat. Hist. Soc. of the Univ. 
of KharkofT, vol. xv) , an account of the parasitism of the larva 
of Systoechus Ie2icophceus Meig. in the egg-sacs of Stauronotus 
vastator Stev. His observations seem to have covered also the 
years 1879 and 1880, the same period during which I was gradu 
ally getting the truth as to the true character of the Bombyliid 
larvaB infesting the egg-sacs of Caloptenus spretus. It will be 
remembered by most of you that Mr. J. Calvert, as subsequently 
appeared in the Transactions of the London Entomological So 
ciety, was, during the same period, making similar observations 
in the Dardanelles. While the observations of Mr. J. G. 
Lemmon in California were subsequent to and instigated by my 
own (he having been employed by me to make observations 
and report on Camnula pellucida)* and our observations cannot 



22 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

therefore be considered independent, there seems little doubt that 
those of Calvert and Stepanoff were entirely independent, and, as 
Osten Sacken points out, it is a little remarkable that in three 
different parts of the world similar original facts on the same 
family and even the same genera were being observed during the 
same year. Such coincidences are not at all rare in the history 
of discovery ; indeed, they are sufficiently frequent to lead to the 
conclusion that they are due, in no small measure, to similar fa 
vorable opportunities owing to the abnormal abundance of the 
species observed. 

The correspondence between StepanofFs observations and my 
own go still farther, for he also found an Anthracid, namely, 
Mulio obscurus, similarly feeding in the larva state on the locust 
eggs, just as I found Triodites mus associated with Systcechtis 
oreas; while he discovered also an Anthomyia egg-parasite 
which he determined as Anthomyia radicum, thus referring it to 
the very species to which originally I referred ours, but which 
was subsequently decided by Meade to be Anthomyia angusti- 
frons. 

While touching on the egg-parasites of the AcridiidaB, it may be 
of interest to mention that I have recently received from Dr. A. 
Ernst, of Caracas, Venezuela, a number of specimens of a Scelio 
which he found very abundant in the eggs of Acridium pere- 
grinum. The receipt of the specimens from Dr. Ernst has led me 
to study more carefully the species originally described as Calopten- 
obia ovivora, but which was subsequently, upon further examina 
tion, referred to Scelio fameliciis Say. The result of the recent 
studies would indicate that Caloptenobia ovivora, while belonging 
properly to the genus Scelio, is really quite distinct from Scelio 
famelicus, and will therefore hold good specifically. The speci 
mens were bred from eggs of CEdipoda Carolina by Mr. S. H. 
Scudder. Those from Dr. Ernst are larger and constitute a new 
species which I propose to call ernstii, while others bred from 
the eggs of Caloptenus atlanis constitute a third species inter 
mediate in size between the other two, and which will be 
described as caloptenortim. Dr. Ernst has also found some 
other parasites of the locusts themselves, and notably Priononyx 
striata Sm., just as we found P.atrata St. F. attacking spretus ; 
also a species of Mermis. All these facts go to show how great 



OF WASHINGTON. 23 

is the unity of habit in the same genus in widely different parts of 
the world. 

During the year I have had an excellent opportunity of studying 
the course of the French people in their fight against Phylloxera 
vastatrix, and it has been most gratifying to see how at last the 
insect is no longer feared by those who have tried most persist 
ently to deal with it. With the improved methods of applying 
bisulphide of carbon, both by hand injectors and by more com 
plicated machines drawn by horses, the French grape-grower can 
measurably protect his vineyards^ and I have every hope that 
future experience with the kerosene emulsion will give them 
another important and valuable remedy ; but the chief reliance is 
on the resistant American vines, and it was most gratifying to 
find, over hundreds of square miles, vineyards previously devas 
tated entirely reconstituted by such means. In fact it was notice 
able that the grape-growers there were in far greater dread of the 
Downy Grape-leaf Mildew, Peronospora viticola, which was 
imported in 1877 upon American vines, than of the Phylloxera. 

Perhaps one of the most interesting discoveries of the year 1884 
is the mode of oviposition in some of our Carabidre. Schaupp 

(Bull. Br. Ent. Soc., I, p. 35) states that, having placed several 
specimens of Carabus limbatus in a breeding cage on March 
3ist, he observed afterwards in the cage one larva and several 
eggs; again he says (I.e.) that in a cage wherein several 

Chi an ins cestivus and Galerita Janus were kept he observed, 
on July 4th, one larva of Galerita, two of Chlanius, and 
"several eggs." He does not describe the eggs and only refers 
to them (1. c., p. 26) as " usually imbedded in the earth." 

From the terrestrial habits of most of our species one would 
expect that the eggs are deposited within the ground, and such 
may yet prove to be the case with many ; but I have proved by 
actual breeding from eggs to the imago that it is not so with 

Chlcenius impzinctifrons, and have strong proof that Chi. cesti 
vus, Scarites subterraneus and the genera Diccelus and 

Galerita share with that species its singular mode of oviposition. 
The remarkable and unexpected fact, in insects so essentially 
terrestrial, is that the eggs are laid singly on the leaves of trees 
and shrubs and encased in a covering of mud or clay. I had 
often observed these little convex mud-cells on the underside of 



1 

24 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

leaves while collecting along the Mississippi in Missouri in years 
gone by, and was puzzled to make out their real nature. In 
May and June, 1883, while collecting on the Virginia side of the 
Potomac with other members of this Society, I found these clay 
cells tolerably common and, fortunately, fresh, each containing a 
large soft white egg. That year I obtained larvae, but only during 
the past year were any of these reared to the imago. Similarly 
remarkable oviposition away from the food or habitat of the 
larva is known in the Lepidoptera and Neuroptera. 

Gentlemen, it is just one year ago this evening that we organ 
ized, and while we have little to review, it may not be unprofit 
able to anticipate our future, or at least what we should hope and 
aim for. 

We organized to promote the study of Entomology in all its 
bearings and to cultivate social and friendly relations between those 
in any way interested in the science. Those most interested in 
the organization had the latter object most prominently in mind. 

We have here in Washington a number of collectors and ama 
teurs and some well-known specialists, in addition to the force of 
the Entomological Division of the Department of Agriculture. 
The Division constitutes a force that I feel justly proud of, and 
the working of which has been commended by those who have 
had occasion to become familiar with it. Yet how far it falls 
short of my own ideal and of the necessities of the country, or 
how difficult it is to build it up to that ideal under the unfortunate 
political unscientific atmosphere that pervades the Department, 
no one more fully appreciates than myself. The facts remain, 
however, that there is a good number of active observers whose 
interest in the subject of entomology is not confined to the par 
ticular biologic and economic work of the Division, but encom 
passes much that could not properly be brought within its scope. 
The members of the Division have, naturally, become members 
of the Society and form a good basis for its existence ; yet it 
would be manifestly unnecessary, if not improper, for the mem 
bers of the force to band together in private simply for the dis 
cussion of those entomological subjects which they are working 
with me to further in official capacities. 

It was to get away from official surroundings, away from the 
work of the U. S. Entomologist, that the members of the Di- 



OF WASHINGTON. 25 

vision decided to join in the organization of this Society. It was 
still more to get better acquainted with those of kindred tastes 
outside the Department, in Baltimore and elsewhere, as well as 
in Washington, and to cultivate social intercourse and interchange 
of views and experience. 

From this standpoint it was, perhaps, unfortunate that you 
chose me as your presiding officer ; for I feel deeply that we 
should avoid everything that may create the impression that the 
Society is but an echo of the official organization. 

Our efforts to enlist the sympathy and co-operation of all the 
entomologists have been measurably successful, if not as fully so 
as we have wished ; but by perseverance and creditable work, we 
may hope to enlist the co-operation of all, and in time add them 
all to our roll of members. 

The field is wide and there is an abundance of work to do, 
and more particularly serious work. It is more creditable to any 
author to publish some full and complete account of any one in 
sect, whose characters and habits have hitherto been unknown, 
or a synopsis or monograph of some genus or family, than to 
cast to the world a w^hole number of hasty descriptions of spe 
cies ; for while descriptive \vork thoroughly and faithfullv done 
is of the highest order and most creditable, it is a fact that many 
entomological writers have busied themselves with descriptive 
work which has had little other result than to confuse and per 
plex all subsequent honest and serious workers in the same field. 

Certain recent descriptive Coleopterological workers might be 
cited, by way of illustration ; but it is chiefly among Lepidopter- 
ists that the unsatisfactory and careless descriptions prevail. I 
would earnestly urge upon all the members of our Society the 
great value and significance of anatomical, embryological and 
histological work, and such monographic work as I have already 
indicated. 

We are fortunate, not only in our surroundings here in Wash 
ington, but and we may say it without vanity also in the di 
versity of the interests which our membership represents. 

Messrs. Schwarz and Hubbard are alreadv known for their 

tt 

work in Coleoptera. Mr. Howard is devoting himself to the 
study of the smaller Hymenoptera, and will easily be led to 
interest himself more and more in the whole Order. Our 



26 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

neighbor in Baltimore, Mr. Uhler, is authority in Hemiptera, 
and Mr. Heidemann has begun to collect in this Order with 
enthusiasm. Mr. Pergande has for some time been carefully 
studying the Thripidse. Mr. Bruner is taking up the Orthoptera, 
Mr. Smith is doing good work in the Lepidoptera, while Mr. 
Marx is well qualified in Arachnida. 

In the general bibliography of the subject Mr. Mann has few 
superiors, and we have several enthusiastic collectors who in due 
time will, let us hope, make their mark in some specialty. 

My own studies are confined to no one Order, but rather em 
brace biologic studies in all Orders, though by way of specialty 
I have for many years been accumulating material and notes on 
galls and gall insects, of all Orders, on the Homoptera and on the 
Diptera. 

While six years ago there were no collections in Washington 
worthy the name, beyond that of Coleoptera by Mr. Ulke and that 
of Lepidoptera by Mr. Schoenborn, we have to-day, what with 
the private and national collections at command, very fair repre 
sentation in all Orders. 

We have started on a moderate basis in the belief that it is bet 
ter to go slow at first than to exhibit abnormal activity that could 
not be kept up in subsequent years. Slow development is corre 
lated with longevity in the animal kingdom, and the principle has 
been exemplified in the history of some societies. 

" Large streams from little fountains flow, 
Tall oaks from little acorns grow," 

and let us hope that there is a great future for the Entomological 
Society of Washington. 

We have for reference,- aside from our private libraries, those 
of the Department of Agriculture, the National Museum, and of 
Congress, which are rapidly growing more extensive and valu 
able. We have, moreover, a most interesting faunal location, 
in which are represented many interesting species ; for, while our 
fauna is essentially southern, many forms belonging to the north 
ern and southern faunas unite, and have their limit line in the 
District. We have already planned the preparation of an insect 
faunal list of the District, and I sincerely hope that during the 
coming season further material for this work will be diligently 
collected ; for the publishing of such a list, preliminary though it 



OF WASHINGTON. 27 

should be, will prove a fitting debut before the world. We have 
therefore every reason to be hopeful for our Society. 

Many of us are connected with Government work, and official 
life at best is more or less uncertain. Some of us may not tarry 
long in Washington, or may soon cease to become active mem 
bers, but there is every promise that others w r ill take the places 
of those of us who may leave, and in closing this first presidential 
address of the Entomological Society of Washington, I can but 
express my earnest hope that it will have a grand future, and help 
to promote all that is high and noble in the study of insect life, 
and to raise that study in the eyes of our fellow-men ; to render 
it, in other words, worthy of the highest talent and the deepest 
thought. 



APRIL 2, 1885. 

Six members present. Second Vice-president Marx in the 
chair. 

Mr. Mann exhibited a specimen of Rhagium lineatum cap 
tured two days previously in the streets of Washington. Mr. 
Schwarz remarked upon the early appearance of this Ceram- 
bycid on the walls of houses or at other places within cities. 
The species lives under pine -bark and hibernates as imago under 
such bark. Thus it is frequently brought into cities with pine 
wood, and as such wood is often stored in cellars and other shel 
tered places, the beetle appears quite early in the season, or even 
in midwinter on warmer days. 

Mr. Schwarz exhibited specimens of Rhopalopus sanguini- 
collis, and remarked that this is one of the few species of Coleop- 
tera peculiar to the mountainous regions of the Alleghanies. The 
scarcity of species peculiar to the higher montane region of that 
range, and the almost complete absence of such peculiar forms on 
the lower altitudes, is strongly contrasted with the abundance of 
montane and colline forms in Europe. As the probable reason of 
this difference, he gave the influence of the long-established culti 
vation of the soil in Europe, by which the fauna and flora of the 
plains have been gradually brought in contrast with those of the 
less cultivated hills and, still more strongly, with the not culti- 



28 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

vated higher mountains. In North America the corresponding 
faunas and floras representing the more original state of things 
have not yet become separated. The fauna of the Alleghanies 
nowhere represents an alpine character, that of the White Moun 
tains in New Hampshire being essentially arctic in its character. 

Mr. Howard made a statement in regard to the parasites of 
Thyridopteryx ephemerccformis. He had found a Chalcid 
larva feeding within the bags of this species upon the larva of the 
Ichneumonid parasite, Hemiteles thyridopterygis, and surmised 
that the Chalcid would prove to be the Pteromalus often bred 
from Thyridopteryx bags. This observation show r s that one of 
the so-called parasites of the Bag-worm is secondary, and so in 
jurious rather than beneficial. The speaker generalized on the 
distinction so difficult to draw between primary and secondary para 
sites and urged the importance of close observation and extend 
ing rearing of parasites in order to form a basis for a separation 
between the injurious and beneficial species. 

Dr. Marx spoke on the Arachnida collected by Dr. L. M. 
Turner in northern Labrador. As was to be expected in a coun 
try almost destitute of trees, the species living under stones and 
moss were much more represented than the web-constructing 
species living among trees. The best represented family is that 
of the Lycosida, next the Drassidce, and then the Thomisoidce. 

Mr. Schwarz exhibited specimens of Eutyphlus and Nicotheus 
of the Coleopterous family Pselaphidae, the latter genus being 
recently established by Lieutenant Casey. After a close examin 
ation of the two genera, he has no doubt that Nicotheus is 
synonymous with Eutyphlus, and that even the specific difference 
of the two insects may be doubted, the only difference being the 
well developed eyes in Nicotheus. 



MAY 6, 1885. 

Six persons present. Dr. Barnard in the chair. 

Mr. Stewart inquired as to the best places and best methods for 
collecting Neuroptera, and Dr. Barnard, Mr. Howard and Mr. 
Schwarz gave their experience in regard to several families and 
genera of that Order. 



OF WASHINGTON. 29 

Mr. Schwarz exhibited specimens of Epiccerus imbricatus 
and stated that this Otiorhynchyj beetle has been very abundant 
early this spring under stones along the Potomac river. All 
specimens still possessed the mandibular appendages, thus show 
ing that they were freshly hatched. One specimen illustrated the 
process of losing these appendages. They do not break off in 
one piece, but the basal third remains attached to the mandibles 
and must be lost at a later time. 

Mr. Schwarz, referring to the hibernation of Rhagiumlineatum 
as imago under pine bark, stated that this mode of hibernation, as 
exemplified by this and some other Cerambycidae, as well as some 
other insects, differs from what ought to be considered as the true 
hibernation of the imago. The true hibernation as imago takes 
place in insects which have moved about and taken food in the 
course of the previous summer or fall, and which have then, upon 
the approach of cold weather, or sooner, sought out, and gone 
into suitable winter quarters. In the case of this Rhagium the 
imago hatches in the place prepared by the larva. It is born in 
its winter quarters and remains therein in a dormant state until 
spring.

Five persons present. President Riley in the chair. 

Mr. Howard remarked upon his experience regarding the edi 
bility of the Periodical Cicada. He hacl continued the experi 
ments begun by Dr. Riley, the latter having been called away 
from town. With the aid of the Doctor's cook he had prepared 
a plain' stew, a thick milk stew and a broil. The Cicadas were 
collected just as they emerged from the pupa and were thrown 
into cold water, in which they remained over night. They were 
cooked the next morning and served at breakfast-time. They 
imparted a distinct and not unpleasant flavor to the stews, but 
were not at all palatable themselves as they were reduced to noth 
ing but bits of flabby skin. The broil lacked substance. The 
most palatable method of cooking is to fry in batter, when they 
reminded one of shrimps. They will never prove a delicacy. 

Dr. Riley related some of his observations made this season on 
the Periodical Cicada, dwelling more particularly on the follow- 



30 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

ing points : the changes taking place in the insect after immer 
sion in alcohol ; the mode of issuing of the imago from the pupa 
and the resemblance of this act to the same in the Atridiida ; on 
the sexual differences in the pupa. 

Mr. Heidemann exhibited colored sketches illustrating two 
stages of the issuing of the Cicada from the pupa. 

Mr. Schwarz remarked on a species of Scolytus, bred from 
Hickory twigs by Dr. Hamilton of Allegheny City, Pa., and 
referred by him, in a recent number of the Canadian Entomolo 
gist, to 5. rugulosus. This species from Hickory is undoubtedly 
different from the last-named species and apparently undescribed. 

Dr. Riley stated that he had bred Walshia amorphella from 
roots of Loco Weed, the species having previously been known 
as a gall-maker on Amor p ha fruticosa. In this connection he 
also stated in reference to another gall-maker on Solidago, (which 
he had illustrated with the above-named species in his 2d Report 
on the Insects of Missouri) , that his recent researches led him to 
doubt the synonymy of Euryptychia saligneana Clemens with 
Pcedisca scudderiana Clem. 

Dr. Riley further stated that Sphida Grote had no existence in 
nature, Sphida obliquata Gr. & R. being synonymous w r ith 
Arzama densa Walk. He had examined the type in the British 
Museum. 



NOVEMBER 18, 1885. 

Ten persons present. President Riley in the chair. 

An invitation from the Chemical Society of Washington to 
attend the Annual Address of the President was read and ac 
cepted. 

Mr. Lugger exhibited photographs of the different stages of 
Ccenia dimidiata Fabr., and gave an account of its larval history 
and habits. The following is an abstract of his paper : 

In May} 1883, he found the same larva as figured by Packard, {Guide to 
the Study of Ent., p. 466, fig. 433), and which had never been bred before. 
He found no less than 214 specimens clustered together at the' base of a 
willow tree, but slightly covered with dead leaves and very little moss. 
The larvae closely resemble the cast off skins of the common Ontscus found 
in similar localities. Scattered between the leaves were numerous speci- 



OF WASHINGTON. 31 

mens of a young Helix, evidently born in that locality. The bark of the 
tree near these larvae was slightly decayed ; a stone pressing against the 
growing tree being the cause of this decay. Taking the larvae home to a 
breeding cage, they remained motionless for some days. Later, however, 
with increase of temperature, they showed signs of life by slowly crawling 
about, evidently with the view of fastening themselves mor'e securely to 
pieces of bark, stones, etc. Their motion was very sluggish a Helix 
moving with the velocity of lightning express in comparison with them. 
The peculiar waxy appendages of the segments of this larva are notfleshv, 
as stated by Packard, but are hollow tubes and not flexible. The larva 
otherwise is well figured in the Guide. 

In the course of about ten days some of the larvae had transformed to 
pupae. The pupa is formed inside of the larval skin, and no outward indi 
cations are perceptible, excepting a slightly paler and more uniform white 
color of the larva ; its shape does not change at all. A longitudinal slit 
along a subdorsal suture on each side is only revealed by pressing the larva. 
The white pupa is thus snugly hid from view, and the resemblance to a 
skin of Oniscus is even more perfeqt than before. In six days a perfectly 
white imago would issue from one of these slits, leaving the empty pupal 
skin in the posterior part of the larval skin. The imago changed its color 
very rapidly ; first, to a very light sky blue ; later, the posterior portion of 
the wing-covers acquire a dark blue, and the anterior portion an orange 
color. The beetles are very sluggish for some time, but during the warm 
hours of the day would fly about quite actively. They freely copulated, but 
only one egg was obtained, which, being unfertilized, soon shrank up. He 
doubts that these larva are carnivorous, but thinks them to be vegetable 
feeders. 

Dr. Riley called attention to the similarity in structure and 
habit of the larva of Calopteron terminate to that of the Caenia. 
That of Calopteron is gregarious and lignivorous. He had also 
known Photirius pyralis to feed on snails. 

Mr. Mann explained at length the Dewey decimal system of 
classifying and arranging books. This system uses decimally 
cumulative Arabic numerals corresponding and attached to the 
divisions ot a logical classification of subjects, in combination 
with an alphabetic index referring by number to the several di 
visions, thus combining the advantages of logical and alphabetic 
classification without their disadvantages. It can be used in as 
great or little detail as desired, and is especially applicable to in 
dices rerum and library shelf classifications. Its definite charac 
ter rende'rs it a standard, and it is already more widely in use 
than any other system of subject classification. Dr. Riley took 
the ground that, while the system is an admirable one for large 



32 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

libraries, there is no need of it for limited or private collections 
of books. 

Mr. Smith read a translation of a paper by' Dr. Gerstascker on 
the position of the genus Pleocoma LeConte, in the Lamellicorn 
series, from the Stettiner Entomologische Zeitung, 1883, Dr. 
Gerstascker maintaining that Pleocoma has to be removed from 
the Scarabceidce laparosticti and to be placed among the Melo- 
lonthidag of the group Scarabceidce pleurosticti^ and further that 
the larva described by Osten Sacken as that of Pleocoma cannot 
possibly belong to that genus nor -to any genus allied to Geo- 
trypes, and that it is undoubtedly that of a Lucanid. 

In discussing the paper Mr. Schwarz said that Dr. Gerstsecker 
was no doubt correct in his views regarding the position of 
Pleocoma, but that he did not sufficiently emphasize the fact that 
Dr. LeConte had at his disposal for his first two papers only a 
single mutilated specimen without abdomen, and that in his sub 
sequent publications on the subject Dr. LeConte had relied on the 
characters drawn from that broken specimen. The most inter 
esting question, however, is : what is the larva described by 
Osten Sacken as that of Pleocoma, since there is no Lucanid 
known to occur in California which is of the size indicated by 
the larva. 

Mr. Howard called attention to the fact that the Thoracantha 
floridana, described by Mr. Ashmead in the July (1885) num 
ber of the Entomologica Americana as new to the United 
States, is the same insect as that exhibited bv him to the Society 
in the fall of 1884, and which was collected by Mr. Schwarz at 
Haw Creek, Florida, in July, 1883. 



DECEMBER 3, 1885. 

Eleven persons present. President Riley in the chair. 

Mr. Lugger presented to the Society a Persimmon cane which 
was carved in a remarkable , and at the same time beautiful man 
ner by the uncovered larval galleries of Dicer ca obscura. 

The cane was accepted with thanks to the donor, and the 
Society decided to turn it over to the National Museum. 

In this connection some remarks were made by Prof. Riley,

Address OTTO LUGGER, Department of Agriculture, Washington, D. C. 



OF WASHINGTON. 33 

Messrs. Lugger and Schwarz, regarding the food-habits of Bu- 
prestidae, mainly discussing the question whether the laryaB at 
tack healthy trees or only such as are diseased or dying, and, 
further, whether they are able to live and finish their transforma 
tions in dry wood. 

Mr. Smith exhibited a specimen of Pleocoma Behrensi which 
he had received from Utah Territory. This locality is interest 
ing, since the species of this genus have hitherto been recorded 
onlv from central California. 

j 

Mr. Smith exhibited a careful drawing of the larva of ApJio- 
rista vittata, rflade from specimens found in October, near 
Washington, feeding on a kind of snow-white mould on the un 
der side of a log. He gave a description of the full-grown larva 
of this Endomychid beetle,* drawing particular attention to the 
peculiar lateral appendages and the peculiar structure of the hairs. 

Several theories were advanced by the members present to ex 
plain the nature and function of the lateral appendages in this and 
other Coleopterous larvae, representing several widely different 
families. 

Dr. Riley spoke on the larval habits of Lixus. In 1872 he 
bred Lixus macer from the stems of Chenopodium hybridum, 
the larva boring down the axis of the stem, as usual, and the 
beetle issuing through a circular hole in the side of the stem. Mr. 
F. M. Webster had bred the same species from Helianthus, the 
larva girdling the stem from within at the upper end of the burrow 
and plugging up the girdle with fibre. The beetle then issued 
from the cut end. Another species, Lixus par cus, from Califor 
nia, is also anomalous, the larva producing a gall on the stems of 
Amelanchier. 

Dr. Riley also called attention to the girdling habits of Pcedisca 
obfuscata Riley, MS., which also issues through the amputated 
end, but in this case the orifice is plugged up with a web spun 
by the larva. 

Mr. Schwarz exhibited specimens of an undescribed Calandrid 
beetle, \vhich is interesting on account of its food-habit, the larva 
and imago having been found by Mr. Hubbard in southern Florida 

*This description is published in full in EntomoL Amer., ii, No. 5, 
August, 1886, pp. 85-87.

boring into the roots and lower parts of the stems of Acrostic/mm 
aureum, a fern growing near salt water. 

Mr. Howard spoke concerning the larval respiration of Cory- 
dalus cornutus, calling attention to the fact that the contraction 
of the branchias is more frequent in proportion as the water in 
which the larvse are kept grows more stagnant, and that there 
is a definite relation between the heart-beat and this contrac 
tion. 

Mr. Mann illustrated the use of the Dewey decimal system by 
exhibiting samples of Dr. Dimmock's method of preparing classed 
title-card headings, the system being, in his opinion, even more 
valuable to scientific workers than for library purposes. 



JANUARY 7, 1886. 

Ten persons present. President Riley in the chair. 

Prof. Herbert Osborn was elected a member of the Society. 

The election of officers for 1886 took place. Dr. C. V. Riley 
was elected president, but declined to serve on account of his ill- 
health and as he had already served two terms. A second ballot 
resulted as follows : 

President, L. O. Howard ; ist Vice-President, Dr. J. G. Mor 
ris ; 2d Vice-President, Dr. Geo. Marx ; Corresponding Secretary, 
J. B. Smith ; Recording Secretary, E. A. Schwarz ; Treasurer, B. 
P. Mann ; Members of Executive Committee, Dr. C. V. Riley, O. 
Lugger, and Theo. Pergande. 

The Corresponding Secretary read the following letter from 
Judge Lawrence Johnson : 

MINDEN, LA., Dec. 16, 1885. 
Mr. L. O. HOWARD : 

* * * Still let me send in my contribution to specimens : 

1. Fragments of iron ore and other rock, with cases of Ephemerids at 
tached. There is a larger rock for you in one of my geological boxes. It 
is from Poston Bayou, of Red River, Bossier Parish. The principal thing 
worthy of note is how the little fellows adapt themselves to circumstances. 
In the softer clay of the same bank they excavate burrows, and where the 
rock is too hard they have contented themselves with a caddis of silk and 
bits of silt adhering to the rock. 

2. A vial containing Mallophagous parasites of the large White Pelican 
of Bisteneau Lake, La. * * * The bird had been killed about twelve hours.

and it was so that he hung with his head just out of water, with a large 
part of the body immersed. The insects climbed to the highest point, and 
were trying to get their daily meal off of the naked parts in or near the 
mouth. This gave me opportunity to collect a good many at once. 

3. In a smaller box is saved the chrysalis of a worm I found among the 
Beech Aphids, and, as I thought, eating them. But after I brought down 
the twig low enough to see certainly what he was doing he became rest 
less, and, after capture, ate nothing that I certainly saw, but soon changed 
to present form. 

In regard to the latter insect, Mr. Howard stated that, accord 
ing to Mr. Lugger, the caterpillar is that of Peniseca tarquinius, 
and that he (Mr. Lugger) had bred the species during several 
seasons at Baltimore, having found the larva always among Aphids 
on beech trees. 

Prof. Osborn read a paper of which he has submitted the fol 
lowing abstract : 

OBSERVATIONS ON CERTAIN SPECIES OF HEMIPTERA. Hemiptera were 
unusually abundant in Iowa during the fall of 1885, and certain species, 
which have as a rule been scarce or seldom noticed, were so plenty as to 
be quite noticeable. 

Corynocoris disttnctus abundant on blossoms of Golden rod (Solidago) ; 
Alydus eurinus on Red clover (Trifolium pratense); Jalysus spinosus on 
Squash \\r\Q {Cucurbita}; Anthocoris insidtosus more common than usual, 
on a variety of plants ; Phylus angulatus very plenty on Solidago, espe 
cially at Fairfax, la.; Miris sp. quite abundant; Blissus leucopterus, not 
destructive, at Ames, la. ; Calocoris rapidus very plenty on Red clover 
leaves and blossoms, likely to become of economic importance; Lygus 
lineolaris about as common as usual ; Phymatn crosa common. Speci 
mens of rf and 9 exhibited; the 9 the day after being pinned captured a 
fly, and its method of piercing this insect was described, while the specimen 
showed the manner of holding. Acholla multispinosa abundant on Solidago 
blossoms ; Cicada tibicen more abundant than usual ; Ceresa bubalus 
plenty, infesting a variety of plants ; Publilia conc.ava occurred in great 
numbers on leaves of Helianthus perfoliatus ; Brochymena arborea and 
annulata common in the Mississippi valley; specimens of Loxaflavicollis 
from Florida bring the range of that species into the United States. 

Mr. Lugger spoke of the peculiar life-habits of Mesites sub- 
cylindricus and Platypus Jlavicornis : 

The former I found in immense numbers in the roots of the Old-field 
Pine (Ptnus tceda, L). This pine grows very abundantly upon the sandy 
and barren soils of the southern part of the peninsula of Maryland and 
Virginia, and usually close to the shores. The pine roots in which I 



36 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

found these colonies were always dead, and were either sticking in the high 
banks bordering the eastern shore of the Chesapeake Bay, or they had 
fallen down upon the beach. But in either case they were daily twice sub 
merged by the tide. During the months of June and July the beetles would 
slowly emerge at ebb-tide from the roots, if sufficiently dry ; not by many 
individual holes of exit, but only by some few. Some of the roots in 
fested for many years by these insects would look as if riddled by small 
shot. The beetles crawled slowly about these roots as long as the wood was 
dry, and never even attempted to fly. Some specimens would frequently 
re-enter the holes, but chiefly males showed such a habit. The outer sur 
face of these roots, which are always more or less denuded of bark, becomes, 
in time, very hard and tough perhaps one reason why comparatively so 
few holes were made Splitting open one of these roots I found the whole 
interior a perfect net-work of large and irregular burrows crossing each 
other in every conceivable direction, and all partly filled with sand dashed 
in by the waves. Only few roots were thus inhabited by these beetles, 
notwithstanding that great numbers of suitable ones were scattered every 
where. I soon found that only those were inhabited that received at regu 
lar intervals a thorough wetting by the salt water; the rest evidently were 
too dry to suit the beetles. I noticed, also, that the same roots had been 
populated for many seasons, and in particular one large root which had 
been carried out some distance in deeper water, and was thus always rest 
ing upon moist sand. I obtained such beetles for four years in succes 
sion, or as long as I had occasion to visit the spot. 

Mesites nifipennis Lee. seems to be nothing but the immature red form 
of subcylindricus, and both species issued from the same hole. Specimens 
varying from vivid red to dark brown and black could be found together; 
the species varies also very greatly in size. 

Notwithstanding close collecting during the summers of four years, I 
never found a specimen of Platypus flavicornis in situ. One morning, 
however, and just before sunrise, immense numbers of these beetles were 
flying about; they could be caught in numbers by sweeping the air with 
the hand or hat. As soon as the sun rose all disappeared as by magic, 
and none could be found; nor on the three succeeding mornings, when 
the conditions of wind and temperature were the same. The only trees 
growing in the vicinity are clumps of the Pinus tceda, the great majority 
of them dead and decaying from a severe storm some winters ago. These 
pines are perfectly riddled with holes and inhabited by numerous cole 
opterous larvae, which can be plainly heard when passing such trees. 
Whenever a dead tree falls against a still healthy one the latter is doomed 
to die in a very short time in consequence of insects migrating to the point 
of junction. 

Mr. Schwarz added that some other Calandridae, including the 
genera Dryotribus and Macrancylus, exhibit habits similar to 
this Mesites, and that these maritime species constitute a pecu- 



OF WASHINGTON. 37 

liar feature of the Rhynchophorous fauna of North America. He 
also stated that, in his experience, our species of Platypus never 
attack the tops of trees, but are always found in the lower part of 
the trunk, being usually inquilinous in the galleries of other wood- 
boring beetles. 

Dr. Riley exhibited drawings of larvae and pupae of Aphorista 
vittata and Epipocus punctatus and explained the differences be 
tween the corresponding stages of the two species. The larva 
of Epipocus is more ovoid and smoother than that of Exorista, 
the antennae relatively shorter, the lateral appendages dorsal, much 
less spinous, and 5 in number in Epipocus, whereas, in Exorista 
they are ventral and 7 m number. The pupae of both species are 
provided with lateral spines, thus showing great resemblance to 
those of Cassida. 



FEBRUARY 12, 1886. 

Eleven persons present. President Howard in the chair. 

Mr. Howard read a note from Dr. Riley in relation to the food- 
habits of the larva of Feniseca tarquinizis, in which he stated 
that he had for some time had in his notes records of observations 
by Mr. Pergande who had found the larva actually feeding on the 
following species of Aphididce : Pemphigus fraxinifolii, Schi- 
zoneura tessellata, and Pemphigus imbricator. The last named 
species is the Beech Aphis referred to by Mr. Johnson and Mr. 
Lugger. 

Mr. Howard read a paper on the Chalcid genus, Podagrion, 
which is peculiar for the reason that it unites the characters of 
several subfamilies, and that the species of the genus seem to be 
exclusively parasitic on Mantis eggs. He related his experience 
in breeding these parasites, and referred more particularly to the 
mode of oviposition through the hard covering of the egg-masses 
of Mantis. 

Mr. Howard mentioned that Dr. Schafhirt, of this city, had 
given him a specimen of Lasioderma serricorne found alive in 
Pyrethrum powder, which was said by Dr. Schafhirt to be still 
strong enough to kill cockroaches. 

Mr. Lugger exhibited a new pattern of an aquarium which is 
very convenient for rearing and observing all sorts of aquatic ani- 



38 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

mals, even in a very small room. The aquarium consists of a tin 
box one foot square in front and about three inches thick, with a 
glass front. Over this glass front slips a round-oval picture-frame. 
If the inside is painted and filled with water the whole looks like 
a suspended picture of rather unusual thickness. Several such 
aquaria can be grouped together like so many pictures. If con 
nected by syphons carefully graded, a constant flow of water can 
be obtained, which produces the necessary current and supplies 
the needed amount of oxygen. In such aquaria aquatic larvae and 
insects can be studied with great convenience. The addition of 
some water plants adds greatly to the beauty of these aquarial 
pictures. 

Mr. Smith read the following abstract of a paper by Prof, von 
Dalla Torre, entitled " Die Duftapparate der Schmetterlinge " 
(Kosmos, xvii, pp. 354-364, Nov., 1885; pp. 410-422, Dec., 
1885): 

THE ODORIFEROUS APPARATUS IN LEPIDOPTERA. 

The author starts with a statement of the facts that led to the discovery 
some time since that the female of many Lepidopterous insects gives out an 
odor perceptible to the male, and thus induces copulation. Of the anatomy 
of these organs nothing definite is yet known, but it seems proven that by 
extending the ovipositor the 9 can cause the dissemination of the odor 
which attracts the (j\ 

He mentions the discovery by Fritz Miiller (Zeitschr. fur wissensch. Zoo- 
logie, xxx, p. 167) that a butterfly, the larva of which feeds on the " mara- 
cuja," has in both sexes an organ exhaling a very offensive odor, which he 
deems protective. In the <$ this organ consists of two sacs or glands at 
the inner side of the side-pieces (After-klappen) ; in the 9 the glands are 
situated between the terminal and sub-terminal segments, and are somewhat 
larger; in addition the female has two very small clavate filaments, the 
extrusion of which suddenly and strongly intensifies this odor. 

These "protective" odors are not further treated of; but he proceeds 
then to his second group of odor giving organs, which are found on the 
wings in the form of peculiarly shaped scales. 

He credits Baillif, a Frenchman, with the discovery of these peculiar 
scales ; but this author rather considered them as aberrations, and failed to 
recognize the fact that they were found in one sex only. Deschamps, in 
1835, discovered that these peculiar scales are found in the <$ only, and he 
especially studied the situations of the scales and the method of their in 
sertion into the wing membrane, evidently deeming them part of the 
tracheal system. 

Watson, in 1865, studied these same scales, and also came to the conclusion 



OF WASHINGTON. 39 

that they were part of the tracheal system. In 1869 he further examined 
the " battledoor " scales of the Lyccenid<z and other Lepidoptera, and enu 
merates 131 species in which they occur. 

Fritz Miiller. in 1877, called attention to these scales and hair tufts, and 
first asserted their function as odor-giving glands. 

Aurivillius in his work on secondary sexual characters of northern di- 
urnals devotes a large space to the discussion of these scales. The author 
then describes the form of scales in some species, finding them of various 
shapes, usually very different from the other wing scales, and always striate. 
In Thanaos they are hollow. Many of the scales, especially in the Lycee- 
nidce, are covered with rows of very minute globules set into the scale by 
a pedicel. In Pieris and some other genera the tip of the scale is furnished 
with a tuft of fine hair, while the shape is very different from that of the 
others on the wing. In some species of Satyrus the tip is densely set with 
fine hair giving a brush-like appearance. 

In some species of HesperidtE the scales are articulate, consisting of 
several joints, which are easily separated. 

The distribution of these scales is then treated of, and, while they are, 
in rare instances, scattered over the wing, they are usually massed into 
spots, often differing in color from the other parts of the wing. Often, 
also, they occur on the anterior margin of the secondaries, which is cov 
ered by the primaries, or at the inner margin, which is usually more or 
less folded. 

Not only are the $ scales often placed where they are more or less 
shielded, but there are often special structures looking to their protection. 
In Pamphila comma the oblique black dash in the <$ is composed of such 
scales, and they are set into a depression of the wing and overlapped by 
ordinary scales, while in many other Hesperids there is a costal fold, 
tightly closed, and in which these peculiar scales are massed. 

In Danais the peculiar raised spot of the secondaries so well known to 
all collectors forms a sac in which the <$ scales are concealed. What are 
the functions of these scales, and why do they need such protection? 
Fritz Mtiller says they are odorous, and the author proceeds to cite cases 
where the odor was intense enough to be perceived by the human sense 
of smell. In Callidryas argante a musky odor was perceptible when the 
$ scales were exposed, and this was observed in all specimens. In Pre- 
pona laertes the odor is like that of a bat, in Dircenna xantho, vanilla 
like; in both only noticeable at the anterior margin of the secondaries, 
where the $ scales are situated. 

In Papilio Grayi the odor is as agreeable and intense as in flowers. 
Didonis biblis has also a distinctly odorous spot on the secondaries. 
That we are unable to perceive a distinct odor in all cases the author 
does not consider as militating against the idea that the scales give out 
an odor, for he considers the sense of smell much more highly developed 
in the Lepidoptera than in man. 

The fact that the scales are always more or less shielded is explained by 



40 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

the statement that the odor is thus retained until the insect desires to dis 
perse it. It is claimed that the insects have the power to open the various 
sacs or folds containing the scales, and, where the scales are protected only 
by their compact massing, they can be erected, so as to expose their entire 
surface. Thus it is calculated that Pamphila comma can expose a surface 
of 160 square mm. from a spot less than one millimeter square! The au 
thor cites Weismann for the statement that the wings of the Lepidoptera 
contain connected and living cells, capable of secreting the odor-giving 
substance, and claims the presence of minute glands at the base of these 
scales. 

As a separate group of odor-giving organs, the tufts on the feet and body 
of many species are instanced. A number of these are described ; but they 
all take the form of a pencil of hair capable of expansion and ordinarily 
concealed in a cavity of the leg. In Hepialus hecta, in which the arrange 
ments for protecting the tuftings are very abnormal, Dr. Bertkau has found 
the cells secreting the odor-giving substance. In many species a distinct 
odor is perceptible when the leg containing the tuft is crushed. Another 
group of organs is found in the abdomen, also usually so concealed and 
protected as to be invisible. 

In Danais gilippus> erippus, and archippus there is between the eighth 
and ninth segments on each side a closed sac, which, opening on pressure, 
exposes a ball of fine hair that gives out a distinct odor. 

Many of the Glaucopidce have the power of protruding from the abdo 
men odor-giving filaments, while many Zygcenidce have within the side 
pieces (After-klappen) glands filled with a sweetly-scented fluid. Didonis 
biblis is especially favored with odor-giving glands. Not only have both 
sexes a sac between segments four and five of the abdomen, which exhales 
a very unpleasant (protective) odor, but the males have, in addition, a pair 
of glands or sacs between segments five and six, from which proceeds a very 
agreeable, heliotrope-like smell. That the Sphingids, or many of them, ex 
haled a very distinct odor has been long known, and Fritz MUller, in 1876, 
located it in a tuft of hair at the base of the abdomen, which fits into a 
groove in the first segment, so as to be ordinarily invisible. Reichenau, 
in 1880, described at length the structure in Sphinx ligustri, and our author 
snmmarizes his discoveries. 

Mr. Smith added the following remarks : 

Prof. Dalla Torre offers little or nothing that is actually new; but he 
brings together and collates the almost unknown and inaccessible notes 
of other authors, and produces a decidedly interesting and valuable paper. 
Within the last year or two a number of structures similar to those cited, 
have been observed by American authors, and one very remarkable struc 
ture in Cosmosoma omphale was discussed at the late meeting of the Ento 
mological Club of the A. A. A. S., where none of the gentlemen present 
were able to give any satisfactory explanation of the structure. Attention 
was also drawn to a structure in Lygranthoecia marginata, which, in some 



OF WASHINGTON. 41 

v 

points, resembled that in the Sphingidae, and Prof. Riley mentioned that 
in Aletia xylina there were similar, yet still undescribed organs. In many 
of the genera of the Deltoids the feet tuftings assume remarkable and start 
ling forms, and quite a number of these have been studied, and will form 
a chapter strongly confirmatory of the views advanced in this article. 

Mr. Mann remarked upon the interesting character of the com 
munication, and the value of such a summing up of the subject 
as that by Fritz Mliller, which formed the basis of Dalla Torre's 
paper. He called attention to the observations made upon the 
subject in this country, and to the citations of literature which had 
been given in PSYCHE. He said he had observed the protrusion 
of the tufted appendages at the tip of the dorsal surface of the 
abdomen by the living insect in Brazil, and noticed the strong 
odor proceeding from these appendages. The species upon which 
the observation was made seems to be Heliconius phyllis. Not 
having his collection at hand he could not be certain of the species 
further than to say that if there exists any other common species 
in Brazil closely, similar to H. phyllis he cannot make the dis 
tinction from recollection ; otherwise the determination is good. 

Mr. Mann expressed his doubts whether any muscular action 
could take place on the surface of the wings of Lepidoptera, such 
as to erect or move the scales individually, or any physiological 
process go on to replenish the scent scales after their odor had 
been dissipated. 

Mr. Schwarz added that among the many forms of secondary 
sexual characters in Coleoptera some would likely be found to 
be analogous in function to the odoriferous apparatus just described. 
He referred more particularly to the tuft of hair on the mentum 
in the males of Trogosita, and those on the ventral segments in 
the males of Dermestes. Differences in the character of the ves- 
titure in the two sexes are known to occur in Coleoptera ; e. g., 
the genus Hoplia, but in this instance it is hardly possible that we 
have to deal with odoriferous organs. 



MARCH 4, 1886. 

Eight persons present. President Howard in the chair. 
Mr. Howard exhibited specimens of the so-called Jumping gall 
produced by Cynips saltatorius, and of an interesting Chalcid 



42 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

parasite which had been bred from it. The specimens were sent 
to him by Prof. C. H. Fernald who received them from a corres 
pondent in California. Mr. Howard concluded his communica 
tion with a brief account of the literature of the Jumping gall. 

Mr. Howard also mentioned the fact that the well known " Die- 
back " fungus of the Orange had been described in MS. by Mr. 
Ellis as Nectria cocclcola,* the describer having seen specimens 
under which were some of the common Mytilaspis scales of the 
Orange, and thereby forming the impression that the fungus was 
parasitic on the scales. 

Mr. Smith called attention to the fact that in the group of Bom- 
bycids classed as Attacince and Ceratocampince the antennas had 
in the $ two^pectinations to each joint, and proposed to limit the 
family Saturniidce by this character. He explained the differ 
ences between the proportions of the branches and their relative 
situations, and thinks the character a very important one in classi 
fication. Two sub-families are well indicated by the fact that 
in the Attacince the pectinations extend to the tip of the antennas, 
while in the Ceratocampince they extend only two thirds the dis 
tance and then end very abruptly. f 

Dr. Marx read a paper on the genus Thelyphonus, exhibiting 
at the same time a careful drawing of the North American Th. 
giganteus. He stated that Th. excubitor Girard is simply 
the cT of giganteus, as the distinguishing characters of the two 
supposed species are precisely the same as found in the two sexes 
of Scorpions. Thelyphonus has 12 eyes, and not 8, as hitherto 
stated by all authors, since there are two distinct, though very small, 
accessory ocelli situated on each side near the externo-posterior 
slope of the ocellar tubercle. No poison glands could be detected 
on the mandible ; in fact the only means of defence appears to be 
a very strong and penetrating odor, but the position of the odor 
iferous glands could not be ascertained from an examination of 
dried specimens. 

In commenting on this paper Mr. Pergande gave the following 
statement as to the habits of a specimen of Thelyphonus sent to 
Dr. Riley, and kept alive for some time in a glass jar at the rooms 
of the Entomological Division :

OF WASHINGTON. 43 

The jar in which the animal was kept was solidly packed with sand to 
the depth of about ten inches. Shortly after the specimen was put in and 
had surveyed its habitation it went to work to dig for itself a gradually 
sloping channel, the deepest portion of which, after being finished, was 
about five cm. below the surface. The transverse section of the burrow is 
in accordance with the general shape of the animal, /. e. , transversely oval, 
and not much higher or wider than is necessary to allow the animal to 
move freely forward or backward in it. The mode of operation when dig 
ging is, as far as remembered, as follows : It appears to select a place where 
there is already somewhat of a depression in the sand, when it commences 
to scrape with one or the other of the powerful palpi a quantity of sand into 
a small heap in front of it. It then grasps the heap, when of sufficient size, 
between both palpi, and, moving backward for some distance from the bur 
row, turns around and deposits its load, patting and smoothing it some 
what with one or the other of the palpi. It then rests for a moment, with 
only the antennae playing, as if in thought, and, turning around, retraces 
its way to the opening, always using its long and slender antennas cau 
tiously to discover its path. When reaching the burrow it goes through 
the same performance as before. The "antennas" are laid backwards during 
the digging, so as not to be in the way. The channel, when done, had 
reached a length of about 75 or 100 mm., but it took several days before it 
was completed, as the animal often either rested for several hours motion 
less in its burrow or went outside on a hunting expedition. In this case 
the animal was provided with roaches, and its modus operandi was as fol 
lows : It moved very slowly and cautiously about, with its formidable palpi 
outstretched and opened, whilst the antennas were in constant and quite 
active motion, feeling and touching all objects about it and on all sides, 
to discover some unlucky insect in its way, which it might grasp. When 
near a roach it either stopped at once or moved so slowly as to appear 
almost motionless. The roaches in the jar were evidently much alarmed 
by this rather formidable-looking creature, and ran about in great haste, 
and, if happening to be on the sand, kept away from the Thelyphonus as 
far as possible, generally running up the side of the jar. The larger and, 
therefore, heavier roaches had to keep, however, more or less on the sand, 
and, in their haste to escape this enemy, often ran right between its arms, 
though they generally escaped, by losing a leg or antenna on account of 
the too slow movements of their foe. Sometimes a roach sat quite close 
in front of the Thelyphonus, but with its antennas constantly playing and 
evidently on the alert to avoid a sudden attack. 

The Thelyphonus meanwhi e moves his antennae quite actively though 
very cautiously, stretching now one as far as possible and then the other, 
tapping the roach gently on one side or the other to induce the poor vic 
tim to move forward. In this endeavor, after many failures, it gradually 
succeeds, and if a roach at last happens, through much coaxing, to get 
between the opened shears in a favorable position, it is suddenly grasped 
with one or both and brought close to the powerful jaws, where it is soon

killed. The prey is then carried, as a cat carries a mouse, into the burrow 
and is devoured with leisure. 

Mr. Schwarz made a short communication on Rhyncolus cor- 
ticalis. This Calandrid beetle, described by Boheman more than 
40 years since, had hitherto remained unknown to American 
Coleopterists. A specimen from Florida, collected by Mr. H. G. 
Hubbard, corresponds exactly with the description, and the species 
must be referred to Horn's genus Allomimus. It is closely allied 
to A. dubius though apparently specifically distinct. 

Mr. Schwarz also stated that upon examination of about one 
hundred and fifty specimens of the common Tomicus materiarius 
Fitch (now Gnathotrichus materiarius} he had failed to find any 
males among them. In fact, the male sex appears to be entirely 
unknown and has never been described. He alluded to the great 
rarity of, and difficulty in finding, the males of most species of 
those Scolytid beetles which bore into the solid wood, because the 
males probably never leave the burrows.

Seven persons present.' Mr. Mann in the chair. 

Prof. John Murdoch tendered his resignation as a member of 
the Society. 

Dr. Riley stated that on account of severe illness he had been 
prevented from attending the last two meetings of the Society, 
and asked permission to present his address as retiring president 
at one of the next meetings. This permission was unanimously 
granted.* 

Mr. Schwarz offered some remarks on North American Scoly- 
tids. He exhibited a section of the trunk of Red Oak, showing 
the work of Monar thrum mali, the species being hitherto known 
only to attack Apple trees. About twenty specimens of the 
beetle were found in a single gallery. The main gallery runs in 
the solid wood concentric with the bark ; the secondary galleries 
branch oft' rectangularly from the main gallery and run upward 
or downward. They are but little longer than the beetle itself,

of equal width throughout, though much narrower than the main 
gallery, and are presumably made by the larvae. 

Mr. Schwarz further spoke on a large colony of Xyleborus 
pubescens which he found in March near Washington in the 
solid wood of Pinus inops. The tree was dead, and of the hun 
dreds of beetles contained therein not one was alive. The beetles 
had honey-combed the solid wood in all directions, thus obscur 
ing and obliterating the work of the parent beetles and their larvag. 
That the beetles were all dead appears to be a significant fact as 
throwing some light upon one of the means employed by nature 
to prevent excessive multiplication of these Scolytids. It appears 
that, during the development of this large brood, the wood of the 
tree had become dry and shrunken, so as to prevent the perfect 
beetles from issuing from the entrance hole made by the parent 
beetle. Among the numerous specimens cut out from the wood 
there were a few specimens of the hitherto unknown male of the 
Xyleborus, which strikingly differs from the female.* 

Mr. Schwarz also called attention to the fact that the Tomicus 
xylographus Say of Fitch's Fourth Report cannot be Say's spe 
cies, but must, in all probability, be referred to Xyleborus ccelatus ; 
and, finally, that Xyleborus obesus Lee. is, in all probability, the 
male of X. pyri. 

Mr. Smith called attention to some features in the structure of 
the Saturniidcz. The family, as he proposes to limit it, has two 
branches to each antennal joint in the $ 5 no tongue, retracted 
head, short palpi ; plump body, hind legs short and weak, tibiae 
without spurs, tarsi without spines, no frenulum, veins not more 
than n, usually 10, sometimes only 9. The Attacince have the 
antennae pectinated to the tip in both sexes. Except in Telea 
and Actias the discal cell of both wings is open. He considers 
that Samia, Platysamia, Philosamia, and Callosamia are all 
congeneric, and explained the differences and agreements between 
them. Telea seems congeneric with some of the European spe 
cies referred to Saturnia. In Hyperchiria io the antennae are as 
in Attacus, but simple or only serrate in tfre ?. In the Cerato- 
campince the pectinations never extend to the tip ; the 9 has the 
antennae simple, except in Adelocephala bicolor, in which they 



*The male is described in Entomolog. Americ., ii, p. 41. 



46 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

are pectinated as in the d\ except that there is only a single 
branch to each joint of the antennae. .The discal cells of prima 
ries are always closed, and the difference in venation of the spe 
cies was pointed out. The secondaries have the cell unusually 
short in this sub-family, and the relation to Gastropacha is 
evident.*

Four persons present. President Howard in the chair. 
The Corresponding Secretary read the following communica 
tion from Lieut. Casey, U. S. A. : 

Agflenus brunneus Gjll. A colony of about forty individuals of this com 
mon ^European species was taken on the 26th of December last in the sub 
urbs of San Francisco. The specimens were closely crowded together on 
the underside of a board which had long been imbedded in a thick, grassy 
turf In the United States it has thus far only been recorded from St. 
Louis, Ma. (Horn. Proc. Am. Phil. Soc. , xvii, p. 577). 

I have very little doubt of the identity of these specimens with the Euro 
pean insect, as they agree almost perfectly with Du Val's description. 
" There is, however, a slight difference, which may be due to changed con 
ditions of life or other similar cause. Du Val states that the European 
species has the prosternum " sillonne" " [grooved.] This part, in the Cal- 
ifornian representatives, is simply punctate, with scarcely any trace of 
grooves or furrows.

NOTES ON PHRYNUS Oliv. 

BY GEO. MARX, M. D. 

On a former occasion, in speaking of Thelyphonus Latr., a member of 
the order Pedipalpi, and of the high place which this order must occupy 
in the class Arachnoidea on account of its advanced organization, I en 
deavored to demonstrate this latter theorem by pointing out the difference 
in insertion, as well as the change in structure, which the first pair of am 
bulatory organs have here assumed. 



* For further particulars see Proc. U. S. Nat. Mus., 1866, pp. 414-437. 



OF WASHINGTON. 47 

Twill now mention the second representative of that order, viz., Pkrynus 
Oliv., and will first draw your attention to the much higher development 
of the first pair of legs which demonstrates more evidently the close rela 
tionship of these organs with the labial palpi of the insects. 

We have seen that in Tkelyphonus the first pair of legs is not inserted 
into the prosternum but into the lateral sides of the broad labium ; that 
the femur is altered into an extremely long and thin part; that the patella, 
which in the other limbs is extraordinarily well developed, is here wanting ; 
that the tibia and metatarsus are abnormally long and filiform ; and that 
the tarsus, instead of being 3-jointed as in the other legs, is here composed 
of eight joints and not provided tvith the typical tarsa I claws. 

In Phryntts the insertion of the first pair of limbs is the same, although 
the labium as an external organ is in some genera (Damon and Admetus) 
wanting; but the development of these organs has gone still higher. 
While the femur is as in Thelyphonus, only more prominently elongate 
and filiform, the patella is present, but the tibia as such has disappeared 
and is .represented by an extremely long and setaceous part composed of 
numerous (from 25 to 40) joints. The metatarsus and tarsus are also trans 
formed into a long and thread-like appendage with many (90 to 130) minute 
joints and unarmed with tarsal claws. Thus the first pair of legs has 
ceased to be ambulatory in the order Pedipalpi. and has become struc 
turally and functionally true palpal or tastile organs. 

Another point of great interest in Pkrynus is the presence of an organ, 
new to the class of Arachnoidea and the true character of which has 
hitherto been overlooked by naturalists the ligula with a pair of para- 
glossae. 

The genera of the family Phrynoidce possess a well-developed sternal 
plate, and in the genus Phrynus we find a labium inserted into the ante 
rior margin of this sternum. This labium bears a long, cylindrical organ 
the ligula into which is inserted a pair of bristle-like appendages the 
paraglossse analogous in structure to homologous parts in insects. This 
ligula, placed between the base of the maxillae and reaching with the tip 
of its appendages into the oral orifice, enables the paraglossse to act as 
organs of taste in the process of mastication. In the genera Damon and 
Admetus, where the labium is absent, the ligula is inserted in the front 
margin of the sternum. 

It is interesting to observe the peculiarity in which the superior state 
of organization manifests itself in the higher orders- of Arachnoidea. We 
do not meet with a gradually uniform and homogeneous advancement of 
all organs, but we notice in one single organ the unambiguous assumption 
of a higher state of development, or the sudden appearance of a new organ, 
the property of a superior class, while the rest of the organization still pre 
sents relationship with the lower orders. 

Mr. Schwarz offered some remarks on the oviposition of Xyle- 
borus ccclatus and on the galleries of Monarthrum mali, exhib- 



48 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

iting samples of the work of both species and prefacing his re 
marks by a classification of the North American Scolytids from 
the biological standpoint. The oviposition of the first-named 
species was observed by Mr. Smith and himself on April 25 in 
a stump of a freshly-felled Pinus inops. The parent beetle bores 
through the bark and then straight downward between the outer 
most two layers of wood. The egg-grooves are rather large, usu 
ally only upon one side of the primary gallery, and contain each 
from three to five eggs. Modifications in the primary galleries 
were observed when the beetle had entered the wood from the 
cut edge of the stump, and especially when several beetles had 
entered through the same hole. The work of Monar thrum mali 
was illustrated by several pieces of Red Oak wood. The parent 
beetle bores through the bark straight into the wood to a distance 
of from five to seven mm. Then follows a transverse gallery, 
and, in most cases, a second transverse gallery immediately behind 
the first ; in several instances there is still a third gallery. The 
secondary burrows, in which the larvas undergo their transforma 
tions, and which, in all probability, are made by the larvae, start 
rectangularly upward or downward from the transverse galleries, 
and are but little longer than the beetle. Oviposition in this 
species has not yet been observed, and it remains also uncertain 
whether only one or several beetles have been at work when 
there are two or three transverse galleries present. 

Mr. Smith exhibited colored drawings sent to him by Mr. 
Moschler from Germany, illustrating variations in color and 
markings of the wings of Deiopeia bella.*

Mr. Schwarz read the following note : 

ON A NEW FOOD-PLANT OF PIERIS RAP^E. On April 25th, Mr. Smith 
and myself made an excursion on the Brightwood road, near Washington, 
and, while observing several specimens of Anthocharis genutia, Mr. Smith 
mentioned that Mr. Schonborn had just found the eggs of Anthockaris 
on two species of Cruciferous plants, one of them being the common 
Winter Cress {Barbarea vulgar is)* As several specimens of this plant 
were just then in blossom along our road we went at once to work to ex 
amine them. Within a few minutes several butterfly eggs were found 
attached singly to the underside of the larger leaves, and more especially 
of such plants as grew isolated. Upon comparison, however, these eggs 
proved to be different from those of Anthocharis, and. in short, turned 
out to be those of the common Pieris rapce. The Winter Cress is not 
mentioned by Dr. Riley (Report of the Commissioner of Agri., 1883, p. 
in) among the known food-plants of the Imported Cabbage Butterfly, and 
also in Europe the same plant is not known to be attacked by this species. 
At least Kaltenbach does not mention it as such. 

Pieris rapce as is well known is one of our earliest butterflies, appear 
ing in the vicinity of Washington toward the end of March. As there are 
no cabbage plants in the fields thus early in the season, it appears highly 
probable that the first annual generation of Pieris larvae normally sub 
sists on some wild plant, and this common Winter Cress will no doubt be 
found to be the principal food-plant of this species, though it cannot be 
asserted that it is the only food-plant thus early in the season. 

Mr. Lugger offered some remarks on the following subjects : 

1. Introduction of certain foreign insects into this country. 
He first found in 1878 some few specimens of the European 
Aphodius erraticus in the droppings of the Virginia deer which 
are kept in large numbers in Druid Hill Park, Baltimore, Md. 
In the course of a few years the Aphodius became very abundant, 
in early spring feeding upon the droppings of sheep. Now they 
are found in any excrement, and not alone in Druid Hill Park, 
but through a large extent of the neighboring counties. They 
are so numerous that they have actually replaced the formerly 
common Aphodius jimetarius. He also mentioned the capture 
of a specimen of Agra cenea, a native of Surinam, and of various 
South American Cerambycidae in the vicinity of the wharves at 
Baltimore. 

2. On the fertilization of Cypripedium acaule and the Hard 
Maple [Acer.] He described the structure of the flower of our 
common Lady's Slipper, which permits an easy entrance to a 



50 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

species of Andrena, but forces the insect to make its escape in 
such a way as to assure the fertilization of the plant. As to the 
Hard Maples he mentioned an observation of his made during 
the present spring, viz., that the seeds of the numerous specimens 
of Hard Maples in the Smithsonian Grounds were, this year, uni 
formly sterile, owing, perhaps, to the inclement weather during 
the flowering season, which prevented the bees from visiting the 
flowers. 

3. On a case of faulty instinct in one of our Tachina flies, 
which he had observed depositing eggs upon the hard body of 
Rhodobccnus i^-punctatus. The fly had apparently mistaken 
the bright-colored surface of the beetle for a caterpillar, and it 
seemed impossible for the young larvae to pierce anywhere the 
hard covering of the beetle. 

In connection with the remarks on imported insects Dr. Marx 
stated that some time since he received several specimens of 
Epeira diademata from Minnesota, and thus there cannot be 
longer any doubt about the occurrence of this European spider 
in North America. 

Mr. Howard mentioned a remarkable case of muscular force 
exhibited in a specimen of Canthon (probably vigilans) which 
he had captured at night and placed in an empty inkstand. The 
beetle had repeatedly pushed off the very heavy cover, although 
working at a great disadvantage through being obliged to cling 
to the overhanging glass sides. 

Mr. Schwarz called attention to the unusual abundance of sev 
eral species of Lachnosterna during the present season. The 
foliage of various trees in the Smithsonian Grounds had severely 
suffered from these May-beetles, and the damage was particularly 
noticeable in the immediate vicinity of the gas-lamps. 

Mr. Schwarz also said that he had frequently seen this spring, 
under pine bark, the cocoons of the Braconid which is parasitic 
on Pissodes sir obi, and that upon referring to the literature he 
was surprised to find that the name of this Braconid was nowhere 
mentioned in connection with the natural history of the Pissodes, 
although the existence of the parasite was well known to the older 
authors. 

Mr. Howard stated that among numerous other insects a speci 
men of Epicauta cinerea had lately been attracted by the light 
in his house. 



OF WASHINGTON. 51 

. Mr. Smith related his experience with one of our common Blis 
ter-beetles (Macrobasis unicolor) which accidentally got crushed 
on his neck, when Jie had an excellent opportunity to note the 
remarkable vesicatory property of our native Meloidag. 



JULY 8, 1886. 

Six persons present. President Howard in the chair. 

The Corresponding Secretary read a note from Dr. G. H. Horn 
stating that Harpalus caliginosus stridulates very well. The 
noise is produced by the edges of the last two abdominal segments 
being rubbed against an alutaceous space on the inner edge of 
each elytron. 

Mr. Schwarz exhibited a specimen of this Harpalus, showing 
the structure referred to by Dr. Horn. He added that Dr. Horn's 
observation is quite novel, since in Carabidae only the genus Cy- 
chrus was known to be stridulating, but that, in his experience, 
the genus Nomaretus is also able to produce a noise. 

Mr. Smith said that he had never been able to perceive any 
noise produced in Harpalus caliginosus, although he had hand 
led many specimens. 

Mr. Schwarz read the following passage from a letter from Mr. 
H. G. Hubbard, dated Crescent City, Fla., June 20, 1886 : 

* * * "I also send a Bradycinetus ferrugineus which came flying to the 
light a day or two ago. This Bradycinetus died as I held it in my hand. 
It had been very active, and made powerful efforts to escape. Suddenly 
it ' fainted ' and died at once. Can this have been the result of excite 
ment? I often find specimens of Strategus lying dead in the path in the 
morning without sign of injury, and very frequently perfectly fresh and 
limber. I have suspected that death resulted from excitement or exertion." 

Mr. Schwarz exhibited a male of Hydrophilus ovatus in 
which the last two joints of the maxillary palpi are notably flat 
tened. He had seen only one male of this species, and could 
not tell, therefore, whether this character was an abnormal one, 
or whether it occurred in all males of the species. 

Mr. Smith made some remarks on the systematic position of 
the genus Quadrina Grote. The species jg. diazoma is based on 
a unique specimen which, by the kindness of Prof. F. H. Snow, 



52 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

he was able to study. Mr. Grote places it among the Hemileucini, 
but the most cursory glance shows at once its relationship to Cos- 
sus, and it is in the Cossidce, and nowhere else, that this insect 
belongs. He gave a detailed description of the venation, point 
ing out the Cossid affinities of the species.* 
Mr. Schwarz read the following note : 

CICADAS AT FORTRESS MONROE, VA., IN JUNE, 1886. While on an ex 
cursion near this locality, on June 17, Mr. Heidemann and myself had the 
opportunity to hear the noise made by some Cicadas. There were some 
nine or ten specimens in the trees and shrubbery in or near the cemetery, 
not far from the fort, but unfortunately we did not succeed in seeing, and 
still less in capturing, a single specimen. In the year 1885 I had, for the 
first time in my life, the opportunity to listen to the song of the Period 
ical Cicada, to the shrill and continuous notes produced by them where 
they appeajed in large numbers, as well as to the more mournful song 
wherever they were less numerous. But on that day, near Fortress Mon 
roe, I experienced, also for the first time, the difficulty in distinguishing, 
from memory, the song of the Periodical Cicada from that of other species 
of the same genus, and I admired then the musical ear of Prof. L. F. Ward. 
It will be remembered that Dr. C. V. Riley had last year quite a sharp con 
troversy with Prof. Ward, who, from listening to the notes of some insect 
sitting on a tree or shrub, came to the firm conclusion that the insect in 
question was the Periodical Cicada. And this was in the month of Octo 
ber, a most unusual time for the appearance of Cicada septendecim ! 

Neither Mr. Heidemann nor myself could come to a conclusion whether 
or not the Cicadas at Fortress Monroe were the Periodical species ; but, 
in either event, the appearance of a Cicada at that season is of sufficient 
interest to go on record, for the following reasons : If the Cicadas were 
the Periodical species they must either be stragglers of Riley's Brood XXII, 
which appeared in 1885, or belong to a Brood appearing in 1886, and at 
regular intervals of seventeen or thirteen years thereafter. In the former 
case the locality for Brood XXII would be of interest, as will be seen from 
Dr Riley's map, in the Agricultural Report for 1885, illustrating the extent 
of Brood XXII. The brood is not known at all from the southeastern por 
tion of Virginia or from the southern part of Maryland. If these Cicadas 
belong to a regular brood appearing in 1886 they must either belong to what 
is known as Riley's Septendecim Brood I, which is reported from a widely 
distant locality, viz., southern Massachusetts and northern Connecticut; 
or they must belong to an hitherto unknown thirteen-year brood. Both 
assumptions are somewhat improbable. Finally, if these Cicadas were not 
Cicada septendecim, they indicate a species of Cicada which appears at the

same season with that species. It will be remembered that one of the best 
means of distinguishing the Periodical Cicada from other Cicadas is the 
season in which they appear the former appearing always some weeks be 
fore the Dog-day Cicada and other species. If there is at Fortress Monroe, 
and probably also in other sections of Virginia, a species of Cicada appear 
ing at the same time with the Periodical species, great caution is necessary 
in entering Cicada reports coming from the section of the country just in 
dicated. 

Judge Johnson spoke on the ravages of a Cecidomyious gall- 
maker on twigs of JSumelia lanuginosa, as observed by him in 
the vicinity of Shreveport, La. The young trees suffer severely 
from the attacks of this insect. 

Dr. Marx said that he had recently received from California a 
species of Segestria which appears to be identical with the Euro 
pean S. perfida. This Arachnid genus contains in Europe six 
species and was hitherto not known to occur in North America. 

Mr. Howard made a communication on the food-habits of the 
House Wren {Troglodytes aedon) in which he stated that a pair 
had built under the eaves of the porch of his house and raised two 
broods of young of four each. The first brood w#s fed in the 
nest from June ist to June i3th, and on the latter date the nest 
was thrown down by the birds and the young flew to the grass 
where they were observed for several days in company with the 
old birds. The nest was rebuilt in a different place. The second 
brood was fed from June 3Oth to July nth. The food was ex 
clusively insects. On several occasions the old bird was observed 
to carry a bit of bread to the nest, and each time was seen to carry 
it away untouched. The main food of the first brood consisted 
of small black beetles, probably Carabidae, but many small grass 
hoppers and crickets were also carried to the nest, and a few green 
caterpillars, probably larvas of Drasteria erechtea and Platyhy- 
pena scabra. With the second brood the proportion of the larvae 
increased very greatly and the beetles correspondingly diminished. 
A few specimens of Macrodactylus subspinosus, however, were 
noticed to be carried. The birds were most active between 5 and 
9 a. m. and between 4 and 7.30 p. m. A calculation of the 
average rate of returns of the old to the nest and of the length 
of time of feeding showed that about 1,500 insects were fed to 
the first brood while still in the nest. 

Mr. Schwarz spoke on the habits of two species of Horse-flies, 



54 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

Tabanus mexicanus and T. psammophilus, as observed by him 
in Florida. The former species flies only shortly after sunrise 
and shortly before sunset, but attacks warm-blooded animals ; the 
latter is a strictly maritime species, occurring only on the open 
beach of southeastern Florida, and probably never attacks warm 
blooded animals. 



SEPTEMBER 2, 1886. 

Five persons present. Vice-President Marx in the chair. 

Mr. Schwarz, referring to remarks made by him at the last 
meeting, stated that during the months of July and August he 
had handled many living specimens of Harpalus caliginosus 
but without being able to perceive any stridulation ; and further, 
that the flattening in the palpi in male of Hydrophilus ovatus 
is not an abnormal character, but occurs in all males of this 
species. 

Mr. Lugger, referring to the account of the swarm of Cicadas 
observed at Fortress Monroe, Va., on June i7th, said that he 
had visited that locality on July 5th, and captured a specimen of 
Cicada pruinosa. Mr. Schwarz said that on July 5th he heard 
the first Cicada pruinosa at Washington. 

Mr. Smith read a paper on the peculiar odor emitted by 
Dynastes tityus. This is well known to entomologists, but 
during the present season the species has developed into a pest. 
In two States Virginia and Tennessee they have been locally 
so abundant as to saturate the air with the penetrating stench. 
The local boards of health, especially that of Memphis, Tenn., 
disinfected all sorts of foul and suspected localities without suc 
cess, and only by accident was the true source of the smell dis 
covered. It must have required many thousands of specimens 
to have produced such an effect, and it is an interesting instance 
of a new way in which insects can render life burdensome to man.* 

In discussing this communication Mr. Lugger said that the 
favorite food -plant of the Dynastes is the Water Ash (Fraxinus 
sambucifolia) , which is quite common in the vicinity of Mem- 

* See the Article, "Beetles as a nuisance," byj. B. Smith, in Popular 
Science Monthly, xxx, pp. 409-410.

phis. Mr. Schwarz said that in this and other allied genera of 
Scarabasidae the odor is emitted by the imago as well as by the 
pupa, whereas the larva is not, or at least much less, odoriferous. 

Mr. Lugger said that even in the phyllophagous Scarabaeidre, 
e. g., the genus Lachnosterna, the imagos emitted a faint, though 
not unpleasant, odor. Mr. Smith added that also in the cop- 
rophagous genera, especially Canthon, the odor of the imago is 
quite strong and unpleasant. 

Mr. Schwarz exhibited the following species of insects which 
are new to the fauna of the District of Columbia: i. Merope 
tuber of the Neuropterous family Panorpidce. One specimen, 
a male, was found on August 22d under a stone in the woods on 
a dry hillside near Rock Creek. Upon being disturbed the speci 
men ran oft' rapidly, its fore wings vibrating in the manner seen 
in many Noctuids, the hind wings, at the same time, covering the 
abdomen excepting the forceps. Mr. Schwarz reviewed the his 
tory of this remarkable insect, of which only a few specimens are 
known to be in collections. Of its earlier stages nothing is known, 
and of its habits we have only a short note by Dr. Fitch in his 
Fourteenth Report, stating that the two specimens he captured 
were attracted by the light in his house. 2. Chcetoccelus setosus 
of the Coleopterous family Malackiidce, found on August 28th 
on dead oak twigs near Bladensburgh. The only other known 
locality for this species is Columbus, Tex., where it occurred on 
old grape vines in the darkest portions of the bottom woods. The 
male appears to be extremely rare ; the female is among our most 
larviform Coleoptera, and, for this reason, liable to be overlooked 
by collectors. 

Mr. Smith described a peculiar brush of hair at the base of the 
abdomen in Schinia marginata (family Noctuidce). It is a 
pencil of fine twisted strands set into a cup-shaped membrane, 
and usually concealed in a groove between the dorsal and ventral 
parts of the basal two segments of the abdomen. When first re 
moved from this groove, the same smell of laudanum, so notice 
able in Leucarctia acrcza, is also observable here. Spread out, 
a considerable brush of hair is presented. The insect has the 
power of voluntarily spreading out this tuft, and probably, also, 
of again withdrawing and folding it into place. 

Mr. Schwarz exhibited samples of the bark of Red Oak, show- 



56 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

ing the work of an undescribed Scolytid beetle of the genus Pity- 
ophthorus. The galleries which are partly in the bark and partly 
in the outermost layer of the wood are the primary galleries, i. e., 
those made by the parent beetle, and exhibited a feature hitherto 
not observed in any other Scolytid. The female beetle bores 
straight through the bark ; then follows a very short gallery ver 
tically downward, and this is crossed immediately below the 
entrance hole by an extremely long transverse gallery. The 
novelty consists in the short ,vertical gallery, which evidently is 
constructed only for the purpose of enabling the beetle to turn 
around without getting on the outside of the tree. The larval gal 
leries, if there be any, are not yet known. 

The new species belongs to LeConte's group B, and may be called Pity- 
ophthorus querciperda. It is closely allied to P. minutissimus, with which 
it agrees in size, form, and coloration, but from which it differs in the 
sculpture and pubescence of the elytra. In minutissimus the elytra are finely 
and rather indistinctly punctulate ; the pubescence is fine, very sparse or 
nearly absent on the basal portion of the elytra, and denser on the decliv 
ity, but always hair-like. In querciperda the elytra are quite distinctly 
rugosely punctulate, and, therefore, less shining. The pubescence is 
stout, moderately dense on the anterior part of the elytra and still denser 
and scale-like on the declivity. In the two Californian species of the same 
group the pubescence consists of long and short hair intermixed. P. 
querciperda occurs from New York to Florida.

Mr. A. Bolter, of Chicago, 111., was elected a member of the 
Society. 

Referring to the nuisance created this season by Dynast 'es 
tityus, Mr. Howard remarked that the smell had also been quite 
noticeable this season at Raleigh, N. C., on a street lined with 
Hackberry trees ( Celtis ) . Mr. Smith asked whether the larvse 
of Dynastes mature in one or several seasons. He knew, from 
actual observations made by himself and Mr. Schaupp, that Luca- 
nus dama has a period of at least two years. Mr. Schwarz said 
that, so far as he was aware, no observations had hitherto been 
published on the duration of the larval state in Dynastes. Mr. 



OF WASHINGTON. 57 

Lugger added that Osmoderma requires two full years from the 
egg state to maturity. 

Mr. Howard presented a paper on the larval habits of the 
Trichopterous genus Hydropsy che, as observed by him in the 
month of August in the vicinity of Washington.* 

Mr. Schwarz added that in a small creek on the Virginia side 
of the Potomac he had observed vast numbers of a Trichopterous 
net which seemed to differ from that described by Mr. Howard. 
It is cup-shaped, without any terminal tube, and fastened with 
one side to large rocks in places where the water falls in a thin 
sheet vertically or nearly vertically over the rocks. There were 
no larvae in the webs at the time of the observation, toward the 
middle of September. 

Mr. Lugger spoke about the fauna of the island of Abaca, one 
of the Bahama Islands : 

Some members of the Johns Hopkins Zoological Laboratory had made a 
small and superficial collection of insects, etc., during their stay upon 
that island. The following list comprises the whole of the collection : 

Cycloneda sanguinea Linn. Chion cinctus Dr. 

Carpophilus pallipennis Say. Callichroma plicatum Lee. (?) 

dimidiatus Fabr. Acanthoderes decipiens Hald. 

Monocrepidius lividus De G. Bruchus obsoletus Say. 

Chauliognathus marginatus Fabr. Gljptotus cribratus Lee. 

Lachnosterna (two species). Cistela sericea Say. 

Cyclocephala immaculata Oliv. Isomira sp. 

" punctata (a Cuban Nacerdes melanura Linn. 

species). Oxacis dorsalis Melsh. 

Chalepus obsoletus Lee. Pachnaeus sp. (a Cuban species). 

Eburia stigma Oliv. Calandra granaria Linn. 

Looking at the species before him, he was struck by their great similar 
ity to those of the fauna of the sea-coast of Maryland or Virginia. In fact, 
the great majority of them could be collected there as well as upon the 
island of Abaca. The few wasps and ants are not North American; the 
two Hemiptera collected are both North American. The .terrestrial snails, 
however, of which quite a number had been gathered, were entirely differ 
ent from any found in the United States ; all belonged to the Cuban fauna, 
with, perhaps, the exception of a small Piipa. 

Mr. Schwarz remarked that a small collection of insects made

58 [ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

by a non-entomologist usually does not throw any light upon the 
character of the fauna of the particular locality in which the col 
lection has been made. The most obvious insects that are most 
liable to be gathered by a non-entomologist are by no means always 
among the characteristic species of a given locality. This can 
plainly be seen from the collection of Coleoptera just analyzed by 
Mr. Lugger. As to the fauna of the Bahama Islands, his experi 
ence, from a few days' stay on two of the islands, was that at the 
first glance the insect fauna, especially in the Lepidoptera, did not 
seem to differ superficially from that of Florida ; but that, upon 
more careful collecting, the majority of the species proved to be 
different from those occurring in the United States. Mr. Smith 
added that a collection of Lepidoptera Heterocera from the Ba 
hama Islands, which he had occasion to examine, proved to be 
quite different in character from the Floridian fauna. 

Mr. Schwarz commented on two recent publications by Euro 
pean authors on North American Coleoptera. i. The occurrence 
of Leptura variicornis Dalm. in North America, as reported by 
Mr. C. A. Dohrn (Stett. Ent. Zeit., 1886, pp. 191-192).* 2. Mr. 
Fleutiaux's attempt in Le Naturaliste, VIII, No. 41, Sept. i , 1886, 
p. 327, to revive the question of the specific distinctness of Ambly- 
chila Picolominii. This article brings no new arguments, and is 
certainly quite superfluous, in view of the opinion repeatedly set 
forth by Drs. LeConte and Horn, after repeated examination of the 
type specimen. Moreover, Mr. Fleutiaux does not seem to be 
aware of the fact that, at least so far as this Amblychila is con 
cerned, the material now accumulated in American collections is 
by far more complete than that in European collections, and that 
for this reason American Coleopterists are more competent to judge 
on this question than the European entomologists. 

Mr. Schwarz gave a short review of the history of the spread, 
within the United States, of the Asparagus beetle ( Crioceris 
asparagi}, and stated that he had observed it this season at For 
tress Monroe, Va. This locality had been visited by him annually, 
for a series of years, but no trace of the beetle had been found 
there previous to the present season. It appears probable, there 
fore, that the species has appeared this season for the first time

south of the Chesapeake Bay. Quite a number of specimens 
were seen, on June lyth, washed up by the sea on the beach, 
among myriads of Doryphora lo-lineata and their constant com 
panions, the various species of CoccinellidaB. From this mode 
of occurrence, and, further, from the fact that no asparagus is 
grown anywhere near Fortress Monroe, it might be concluded 
that the Crioceris had flown directly across the bay from the 
opposite shore of Virginia. There can hardly be any doubt that 
the Crioceris will have reached, this year, the asparagus grow 
ing region back of Norfolk, Va. 

In discussing this communication Mr. Lugger made some 
remarks in regard to the regions more recently invaded in Mary 
land and Virginia by Crioceris asparagi and C. 12-punctata. 
The former had been, for years, very common in the vicinity of 
Baltimore and along the banks of the Patapsco river where the 
wild asparagus grows abundantly. Two years ago the species 
appeared suddenly in large numbers on Kent Island, doing great 
damage, and in the same year it reached to within a few miles 
north of Hungar's Wharf, eastern shore of Virginia. The 
specimens observed by Mr. Schwarz, at Fortress Monroe, came 
probably from that vicinity, which is almost opposite the fort. 
The Crioceris 12-punctata has spread slowly and has reached 
portions of Anne Arundel County, and even Washington City. 



NOVEMBER 12, 1886. 

Five persons present. President Howard in the chair. 

Mr. Howard read a letter from Judge Johnson, dated Merid 
ian, Miss., Nov. 4, 1886, in relation to the havoc caused by fleas 
among young chickens at Gainesville, Fla. Only the very young, 
downy chickens are affected, and upon these the fleas settle like 
ticks, especially about the head. One of the first symptoms ob 
served is the loss of the voice in the chicken ; then the down 
drops oft', to be succeeded by knots, lumps, and sores. The 
chicken finally dies, and from a large brood only four remained 
after two weeks. Application of kerosene killed the fleas, but 
also the chickens ; and pyrethrum powder had only temporary 
effect. Mr. Howard added that specimens of the flea in question 



60 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

had been sent by Judge Johnson, and that it might be identical 
with Pulex gallinarum. Mr. Lugger alluded to a similar injury 
inflicted on the chickens by a species of mosquito in parts of 
Louisiana. 

Mr. Dodge entertained the Society by giving his long-prom 
ised account of the life and work of the late Mr. Townend Glover. 
Mr. Glover had always been a lover of Nature, but in his earlier 
years he led a wild life until he decided to settle down. He 
bought a place on the Hudson and began to be interested in en 
tomology by taking care of his garden. He then began to write 
for local papers, and to picture insects in their various stages. 
Harris heard of Glover : they met, and a correspondence between 
them was carried on. At the suggestion of Harris and other en 
tomologists Glover began to engrave his drawings, and from that 
time he conceived the idea of producing a great illustrated work 
on insects. After his visit to Florida he intended for some time 
to publish an octavo work on economic entomology, but he 
changed his plan to that finally adopted, viz., to arrange the in 
sects according to orders. His earlier plates are much better 
than many of the later ones, when he engraved with great haste, 
producing plate after plate in very short time ; but his drawings 
were always and uniformly very careful and accurate. His man 
uscript work on Lepidoptera and Coleoptera, which includes 
most of his original notes and observations, forms a nearly com 
plete encyclopedia on these two orders, and is now in the pos 
session of the Smithsonian Institution. By industrious work, 
and by keen power of observation, he had accumulated a vast 
amount of valuable original notes ; but, strangely enough, through 
out all his publications he shrank from making use of his own 
notes, and always preferred to cite the " authorities." Mr. Dodge 
interspersed his account with narrating various incidents and anec 
dotes illustrating the character of Mr. Glover, his mode of work, 
and the many peculiarities of his private and office life. 

Mr. Mann reminded the members that after the death of Dr. 
F. E. Melsheimer, in 1873, he had come into possession of the 
entomological manuscripts and library, and the remainder of the 
collections of Melsheimer, including some of the manuscripts of 
the elder Melsheimer, and the correspondence between Melsheimer 
and other entomologists of his day, such as Say, Harris, Halde- 



OF WASHINGTON. 61 

man, LeConte, and- others. He exhibited a number of manuscript 
and rare printed books from this collection. Some of the manu 
script volumes contain original descriptions, with colored fig 
ures of larvae raised by Melsheimer, with notes on the habits of 
larvae ; others contain descriptions of genera and species of in 
sects, compiled or original, intended apparently for a faunal work ; 
others contain transcripts of scientific writings which Melsheimer 
had been unable to purchase. One quarto volume contains a 
list of Coleoptera (probably those of Pennsylvania) , with notes 
on the season, food-plants, and habits of many species. Among 
the printed books there was a copy of the Catalogue of the Cole 
optera of Pennsylvania, by the elder Melsheimer, published in 
1806, with manuscript additions and corrections bv Melsheimer. 
Mr. Lugger gave a list of insects which he had noticed out 
doors this year very late in the season. They are species not 
usually found at this season. The list is as follows : 

Oct. 19. Leptostylus aculifer, found on the electric light in Baltimore 
during a cold and windy evening. 

Oct. 21. Attacus luna (^, flying about a street-lamp in front of his house 
in Baltimore ; weather rainy and cold. 

Oct. 26. Choerocampa tersa, found flying during a sunny afternoon in 
the Agricultural Grounds. 

Oct. 27. A very large swarm of Cotton Moths (Aletia xylina) at the 
electric lights on Capitol Hill. Wind due west; all the specimens were 
fresh (Schonborn). 

Oct. 27. A few Cotton Moths at the electric light in Baltimore, but only 
at elevated points. 

Oct. 28. All the streets in Baltimore provided with electric lights were 
crowded with Cotton Moths. The same phenomenon occurred six years 
ago, during a heavy rainstorm. It was so cold at that time that snow- 
flakes were mixed with the rain, and snow remained on the streets until 
the following noon. Specimens quite fresh. 

Nov. i. Scepsis fulvicollis; one specimen flying about at Washington. 

Nov. 8. A few Cotton Moths flying about the electric lights on Capitol 
Hill (Schonborn). 

Nov. n. Colias eurytheme, or rather a very pale variety of it, looking 
like Pieris, was flying about some flowers of Dandelion in the Agricul 
tural Grounds. 

Nov. ii. A female of Mantis Carolina was found in the Smithsonian 
Grounds. 

Nov. 12. A fresh specimen of Cicada pruinosa was taken at the same 
place.

Dr. Riley made some remarks on the larvae and larviform 
females of Phengodes and Zarhipis, of which he furnished the 
following abstract : 

NOTES ON PHENGODES AND ZARHIPIS. 

I read with some interest, while in Europe last July, the account in Science 
for July 9th of Dr. Horn's remarks on the larviform female of Ph. laticollis 
and Zarhipis Riversii. I have been familiar, since 1869, with the lumi 
nous larva which was then, following Osten Sacken, referred with a ques 
tion to Mclanactes. I exhibit alcoholic specimens of the form found by 
myself and others in Missouri, and which was first figured by me in 
LeBaron's 4th Rep. Ins. of Ills. (1874); of another series corresponding 
with Zarhipis received in 1883 and 1884, from Mrs. A. E. Bush, of San 
Jose, Cal. ; one received from Henry T. Thomas in 1869, of Franklin, Mo. ; 
one {Phengodes) received from Mr. J. W. A. Wright, Greensborough, Ala., 
June, 1886; two (apparently Phengodes} received in 1875 from Mr. B. P. 
Mann, Cambridge, Mass. ; others received from L. R. Alexander, Piocha, 
Nev., in September, 1883; and, finally, one {Phengodes} from Mr. O. 
Lugger, found near Baltimore, Md., in 1876. 

The structure in all these larvae is essentially identical, but they are 
divisible into three groups doubtless corresponding to as many genera. 
In the first group (Phengodes} the most common form is pale or yellowish 
in general color, with a medio-dorsal series of small, paler, double spots 
near the hind margin of each joint; the mandibles sharp and sickle-shaped 
and the prothoracic joint elongate and narrowed anteriorly. Another 
colorational form in this group the one originally described by Osten 
Sacken has the horny parts much darker, almost black, with a series of 
pale brown or fulvous dorsal spots, two to each joint. In the second group 
{Zarhipis) the color is equally variable, some of the specimens being pale 
brown and showing the small, geminate, medio-dorsal paler spots at base 
of each joint, but most of them being much darker, almost black dorsally 
with no lighter markings. The surface is rather more noticeably shagreened 
and the medio-dorsal depressed line more marked in this group than in 
the first, from which it is at once distinguished by the broader, more trans 
verse head ; but particularly by the broader, more transverse prothoracid 
joint, not narrowed anteriorly. With these exceptions the structure in 
these two groups is essentially the same. In both, the larvae possess a 
large ocellus at base of antennas, and in both they exhibit a remarkable 
peculiarity hitherto not noticed, viz., a pair of small spiracular or spiracle- 



OF WASHINGTON. 63 

like apertures on the dorsal sutures between joints 4-11, and normally quite 
hidden by the telescoping of the joints. The nature of these openings can 
only be speculated upon, as no dissections have yet been made; they may 
be olfactory organs. 

In the paper, " Zur Biologic der Kafergattung Phengodes 111.," by Dr. 
Erich Haase, published in Is is for 1885 (pp. 10-11), the author, without 
referring to Osten Sacken's paper, cites the observations of Dr. Hierony- 
mus, of Cordoba, which first established the relation of the male Phengodes 
with this larva as the female. From a larva received from Missouri in 1883, 
and which was kept for some weeks in a glass jar where it could be seen 
until it reached the pupa state, I had, with Mr. Schwarz, already at that 
time decided that the larva must be referred to Phengodes, though there had 
been no occasion to publish the conclusion, because the specimen had 
unfortunately disappeared during one of my absences, and probably flown 
out as a beetle. The third group consists of the smaller larva from Nevada, 
which may eventually prove to be the young of one of the larger forms, 
though more probably it Avill prove to belong to some other genus. It is 
less narrowed in front, the head is broader, and the whole body is sparsely 
beset with spinous hair. The color is pale, and the ocellus very conspicuous 
each side, looking almost like a compound eye by virtue of its being placed 
on an irregular black patch. No dorsal spiracular orifices are noticeable. 

So far as the specimens justify any conclusion, the only difference ob 
servable between the perfect female and the larva is in the more feeble 
mandibles and tarsi of the former. 

A long discussion on various topics connected with this Phen 
godes matter followed the reading of Dr. Riley's paper. Mr. 
Smith related his experience with one of the luminous larvas 
found at Britain, Conn., and which was kept in captivity for a 
number of weeks ; but it finally died. Mr. Mann spoke on the 
numerous luminous larvae which he found in and around Cam 
bridge, Mass. Among them he had observed two forms, one 
with blunt, the other with pointed mandibles. A third form, of 
jet-black color, could extinguish their light at will, and there were 
also differences in the anal segment. All were kept in captivity 
for a considerable length of time, but none transformed. Mr. 
Schwarz gave a review of the geographical distribution of the 
North American Phengodini, and related that on one occasion 
he had found in florida, during daytime, 4 or 5 male specimens 
of Phengodes plumosa on one spot among the roots of grasses. 

Mr. Schwarz exhibited samples of small, square rods of naph 
thaline which, in this form, is known in commerce as "white 
carbon," and used for intensifying the flames of gas-light The

material is very cheap, costing only 8 cents per pound wholesale, 
and much purer than the naphthaline cones now in market. 
When broken up into small pieces, and wrapped in thin paper, 
it can most conveniently be used in insect boxes. 

Dr. Marx read some abstracts from his work on North Ameri 
can Scorpionidae which he intends to publish. He gave an his 
torical review of the various systems of classification proposed by 
different authors for these Arthropods. The system of the older 
authors, such as DeGeer, Leach, and Koch, was based upon the 
number of eyes, but the more recent investigations by Peters, 
Thorell, and Karsch showed that this character is without any 
systematic value. The North American Scorpionida3 have been 
monographed but once, viz., by Dr. Wood in the Journal of the 
Philadelphia Academy for 1874, where 13 species are enum 
erated. Wood sjtill follows the old classification, and, conse 
quently, described all but two of his species as Buthus. Dr. 
Marx had the opportunity to examine the types of Wood pre 
served in the U. S. National Museum, and, following the more 
recent classification, he finds that not one of Wood's species is 
a Buthus. The type of Wood's Scorpio Allenii, as well as two 
of the other species described by Wood, cannot be found and 
appear to be lost.

ANNUAL ADDRESS OF THE PRESIDENT. 

\ 

A BRIEF CONSIDERATION OF CERTAIN POINTS IN THE MORPHOLOGY OF 
THE FAMILY CHALCIDID^E.* 

BY L. O. HOWARD. 

The number of systematic workers upon this interesting and 
extensive family of parasitic Hymenoptera has always been small. 
Excluding more general writers, we may confine the number of 
specific workers of prominence to the following short list : Dai- 
man, Nees von Esenbeck, Ratzeburg, Forster, Reinhardt, 
Walker, Haliday, Thomson, Mayr, Rondani, Kirby, and Cam 
eron. The work upon the family is, in fact, but just begun. 
The European fauna is by no means thoroughly worked up, ex 
cept in a few sub-families, while in America probably not one 
species in a hundred has been described. 

Nees (1834) Described 316 species of 32 genera ; Walker (1839) 
described 703 species of 12 genera ; the British Museum catalogue 
(1846) mentions 1,094 species of 130 genera ; Forster (1856) char 
acterized 173 genera ; Kirchner (1867) catalogues 2,407 species of 
210 genera in Europe, and Thomson (1875) gives 658 Swedish 
species, belonging to 211 genera. The European genera, since 
Kirchner's catalogue, have been largely added to, and the species 
rather less so in proportion, and we may now roughly estimate 
the described European species at 2,800, and the genera at 300. 
In North America, including the West Indies and Mexico, 474 
species of 72 genera have been described up to this date. 

The insects of this family are quite closely related to the Proc- 
totrupidas both in structure and in habits, and to the Cynipidae in 
structure and in the habits of certain forms of the families, i. e., 
certain Cynipidae are parasitic, and certain Chalcididas are gall- 
makers. The Chalcididae are distinguished from the Proctotru- 
pidae principally by antennal, terebral, and pronotal characters, 
in addition to that summary of all characters which Europeans 
call habitus, or general appearance, and which enables the prac 
tised eye to at once place a species in its proper group. With 



*This paper, as published, is considerably abridged from its original 
form as read. It is but a hint at the external anatomy of the family, and 
will serve to give simply a general idea of the structure a^nd some of its 
principal variations. L. O. H.

the Chalcididae the antennae are always elbowed, and have one or 
more ring-joints between pedicel and funicle. With the Procto- 
trupidae they may be elbowed or not, and seldom have a single 
small ring-joint, in which case they are not elbowed. With the 
Chalcididae the ovipositor arises below and anterior to the tip of 
the abdomen ; with the Proctotrupidae from the tip To this 
character I know of no exceptions, though Thomson, without 
specifying them, states that there are such. The most perfect 
distinguishing character is, however, that in the Chalcididas the 
pronotum never reaches to the tegulae, while in the Proctotru 
pidae it is always separated from the tegulae by a simple suture 
only. The wjng-cells are always undeveloped in the Chalcididae, 
while certain ones are occasionally found in the Proctotrupidae. 
The colors of the Chalcididae are almost invariably metallic, and 
such colors are very rare with the Proctotrupidae. 

[A discussion of the characters used by different authors is 
here omitted for the sake of brevity.] 

In order to indicate the confusion which exists among the dif 
ferent authors in points of nomenclature, I introduce a table of 
the nomenclature of the veins of the fore-wings according to the 
three principal systems :

From this collection of names almost every writer on the group 
has adopted just so much as he chose, so that, except from the 
context, it is almost impossible for the student to understand what 
is meant by any one name. After a careful consideration I have 
adopted in my papers the nomenclature given in the fourth col 
umn. No term needs explanation, and for this reason I use it, 
although, as soon as perfectly satisfactory homologies are estab-

lished between these veins and those of higher Hymenoptera, 
and particularly with other orders, I shall gladly adopt a better. 
Throughout the entire body structure great difficulty arises in ho- 
mologizing with other groups, and in this brief review of the ex 
ternal anatomy and some of its variations I have not attempted to 
alter existing names, nor to suggest relationships, offering it sim 
ply as a statement of form and variation which can, perhaps, be 
read to advantage by one commencing the study of the group. 

The Head. 

In comparison to the size of the body the head Is large. Its 
anterior (dorsal) aspect varies from a broad oval to an elongate 
triangle with rounded superior angles. Its dorsal (posterior) 
aspect also varies from nearly parallelogrammatic, through oval, 
to subcordate. It is usually carried nearly at right-angles to the 
thorax, so that the face is anterior, the occiput posterior, and the 
vertex superior. In the Eurytomince and some others it slopes 
towards the pectus, but in other groups it has the opposite 
tendency towards bringing it into the same plane with the thorax. 

The occipital margin is sometimes sharp {Encyrtince} and 
sometimes rounded (Eupelmince} . In Caratomus, Dalm., a 
curious modification of the usually regular ridge is seen ; a deep 
cleft occurs behind each eye, and on each side of the indentation 
is a marked prominence of the ridge. The face is sometimes 
strongly convex, and occasionally angulate at the middle or at 
the insertion of the antennae : usually, however, it is nearly flat. 
The antennal grooves are frequently entirely obsolete ; some 
times, however, deep and strongly marked. With some genera 
they are parallel, with others approaching either before or behind, 
and with a median separating carina of varying strength. The 
clypeus is transverse, and is either smooth, rounded, or dentate. 
It usually covers the labrum, but sometimes, as in Encyrtus, 
the latter is very evident. The cpistoma is seldom distinguish 
able. The cheeks are either rounded, straight, or compressed. 
They are frequently traversed by a suture, running from the eye 
to the base of the mandible, and this suture is always broadest 
next the eye. It is the sulcus genalis of Thomson. 

The eyes are large and protruding, usually round, sometimes 
verging upon the pyriform, occasionally pubescent, and again 



68 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

perfectly naked. They may approach close together or be widely 
separated ; Chiloneurus and Caratomus being two extremes in 
this respect. They vary in color from bright coral red, through 
reddish-brown and slate to black. The red shades are preserved 
in balsam-mounted specimens, but are lost in pinned specimens 
after death. With certain groups of genera the eyes invariably 
sink in and present a concave centre after death, while with 
others they always preserve their normal form. This sinking 
in also extends to the other parts of the head, very seldom to 
the other parts of the body, so that in these genera, notably in 
the Tetrastichince, the head characters have to be studied from 
fresh specimens. 

The ocelli are comparatively large, and are placed in the form 
of a triangle which may be very acute or very obtuse angled, 
depending to some extent upon the degree of separation of the 
eyes. They vary in color as do the true eyes. Sometimes they 
are small and so hidden by the pubescence of the head as to be 
almost indistinguishable. In the anomalous group Aogonidce of 
Walker there is much variation in the presence or absence of 
eyes and ocelli. Eupristina, for instance, has neither eyes nor 
ocelli in the male, while the female has large oval eyes, but in 
conspicuous ocelli. In Walker ella the ocelli are absent and the 
eyes are small. This is also the case with Sycoscaptella and 
Otitesella . 

The mandibles are usually strongly developed, although not so 
much so as with some of the Proctotrupidae. They are quite 
strongly convex dorsally and are often transversely impressed at 
base. At the apex, and along the median line when closed, they 
are furnished with from two to four teeth. The teeth of the two 
opposite mandibles often differ in number, the right having four 
and the left three. With the Macrocentri the mandibles are 
usually stronger and with more teeth than with the Microcentri, 
in which group they are seldom more than bi-dentate. The 
maxillce are small and consist almost entirely of stipes. The 
galea is imperceptible in the genera examined, and the lacinia 
is simple with almost imperceptible teeth. The maxillary palpi 
are usually 4-jointed, but may be 3-jointed. The labial palpi 
are 3-jointed with the higher forms, but with the lower they are 
rudimentary. 



OF WASHINGTON. 69 

The antenna are very important organs in the classification of 
the group. They vary in number of joints from seven to thirteen, 
never exceeding the latter number. The bulb is not well separated 
from the scape. The scape is long, usually the longest joint, and 
slender; usually sub-cylindrical, sometimes distinctly fusiform, 
occasionally with a leaf-like ventral expansion (some species of 
Encyrtus and Aphycus}, or with a flattened tip {Melittobia}, or 
flattened out and rolled from side to side ( Cerapterocerus) . Its 
insertion on the face varies considerably. With the Pirenince it 
is inserted near the border of the mouth, but usually it arises 
from a point nearer the middle of the face. The distance apart 
of the two bulbs also varies somewhat. The pedicel is usually 
obconical with its apex somewhat curved. It is not inserted 
directly upon the apex of the scape but upon an articulating facet 
ventrad of its distal end. Following the pedicel come, in many 
instances, two ring-joints. These reach their maximum of de 
velopment in the Pteromalince and in some other subfamilies are 
not perceptible. Following the ring-joints come from one to six 
funicle- joints. These present much diversity of form. Their 
simplest form is that of a long, naked cylinder, as in the female 
Psilophrys. The joints of this form vary all the way from ten 
times as long as wide to much wider than long. They may present 
a serrate appearance collectively, as in Habrolepis ', they may 
become gibbous dorsally, as in the male Eurytoma, or each 
may give off* a long branch, as with Eulophus. They may also be 
flattened out so that one face is several times wider than long, as 
in Mira and Anusia. One discouraging fact to the student of 
collected specimens is that the antenna? of the two sexes of the 
same species may differ more widely from each other in form than 
do those of different subfamilies. This is markedly so in all En- 
cyrtid genera. The female antenna? in this subfamily are usually 
regularly sub-clavate and naked, while those of the male are 
usually linear, with each joint strongly constricted above and 
furnished with one or more whorls of strong hairs curved at the 
tip. A similar difference may be seen with some of the Euryto- 
mincz. The number of joints is quite constant in genera, and 
also with the two sexes. Excluding the apparent exceptions to 
this latter rule, in which the club is divisible in the one sex and 
not in the other, the only absolute exception which I have 



70 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

noticed as yet is Dilophogaster, in which the male antennae are 
nine-jointed and the female ten-jointed. Following the funicle 
proper comes the club. This is normally three-jointed, but the 
joints often coalesce, so that they cannot be distinguished. It may 
be conical (I^eucaspis} or obconical ( Cercobelus} ; it may be 
squarely truncate at tip ( Sphegigaster} , or obliquely truncate 
(Coptdosoma), or it may be laterally flattened (many genera). 
The second joint may have a tooth-like projection (JVotanisus} , 
or the tip may be prolonged into a filamentary process ( Chryso- 
charis}. It may equal in length the whole funicle, or it may be 
shorter than the last funicle joint. At the tip of the scape the 
antenna is always abruptly elbowed, and this was formerly con 
sidered one of the most important of the family characters ; but, 
as we have already indicated, it is sometimes found with the 
Proctotrupidae, notably in the sub-family Scelionince. 

The Thorax. 

The prothorax. This segment is composed almost entirely of 
notum, which extends ventrally below the latero-ventral angle, and 
is nearly continuous ventrally, with the sub-family Chalcidince 
in particular. It is usually quite short, although assuming con 
siderable size in the Eurytomince, Aximince, and Torymince. 
Occasionally, when seen from above, it appears conical (Eu- 
lophince}, again transverse quadrate (Chalcidince}. The pro- 
sternum is usually narrow and transverse, but is occasionally tri 
angular, with its apex directed anteriorly. The proepisterna are 
usually narrow and situated in an oblique cephalo-ventral plane. 
In Smicra they are one-half as broad as long. 

The mesothorax. With the Chalcididae the scutum, scutel- 
lum and postscutellum of the mesonotum are distinguishable. 
The so-called postscutellum of Forster is, however, believed by 
Thomson to belong to the metanotum, and would hence be meta- 
prcescutum. The diversity in certain points of the mesonotum 
has afforded good classificatory characters. The mesoscutum may 
be either entire or its lateral portions may be separated from the 
dorsum by deep sutures, forming the so-called parapsidce (Mac- 
Leay),ptag~zscaputares(lria\iday), or scapulce (Thomson). These 
sutures, known ordinarily as parapsidal sutures, usually approach 
posteriorly and sometimes almost meet at the scuto-scuteilar su- 



OF WASHINGTON. 71 

ture. The mesoscutum may have a median longitudinal carina, 
as with Euplectrus, but is usually entire. The mesoscutum is 
divided from the mesoscutellum by a deep transverse suture run 
ning between the fore wings, and which may be straight (Spa- 
langia) or concave anteriorly (Torymus), or posteriorly (Cher- 
chysius). The mesoscutellum is never entire, but consists either 
of three or of five pieces. Two very deep sutures, which usually 
converge anteriorly, separate the scutellum proper from the pa- 
raptera (MacLeay) or axillce (Thomson), and these again with 
many genera are separated from small triangular pieces, which 
Thomson has called the axillulcz. The mesoscutellum proper 
may be either unmarked or it may have a delicate transverse cen 
tral suture {Syntomaspis) or two sublateral longitudinal parallel 
sutures ( Tetrastichus). The mesopostscutellum is small, trian 
gular or quadrate. The mesosternum varies considerably in 
size and shape, from a small, rounded disc to a large, irregular, 
obliquely-placed sclerite. The mesepisterna and epimera are 
large, well developed, and distinctly separated. The episterna 
project up so as to intervene between the pronotum and the 
tegulce on either side. 

The melathorax. The metaprcescutum and scutum are repre 
sented by chitinous transverse bands. The former is usually 
interrupted by the mesoscutellum and appears as a triangular 
piece on each side. The metascutum is also occasionally so 
interrupted, and appears as two patches parallel with and simi 
lar to the above ; but it is also frequently continuous from side 
to side. The metascutellum usually contains entirely within its 
borders the metathoracic spiracles and is quite variable in form. 
It has not been used in classification to any extent except by 
Thomson. It has often a well-marked central longitudinal carina, 
which divides at the neck. The neck is the somewhat elevated 
posterior portion of his sclerite and overlaps the petiole of the ab 
domen. There are often two lateral, usually curving, carinae, 
sometimes replaced by delicate sutures, which cut off the side 
pieces containing the spiracles from the centre of the sclerite. 
The lateral edges of the metascutellum are frequently thickened 
and often turned up, in which case they are usually furnished 
with rather long whitish hairs, as in certain of the Pteromalinae. 
The metasternum is well marked, sometimes notched caudally, 



72 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

and has often a median longitudinal carina. The metepisterna 
and metepimera are large and distinctly separated. 

The wings. Curious and constant differences may be seen in 
the shape of the fore wings by which the family is readily divided 
into two groups. With the Microcentri the wings expand with 
approximate equality on both cephalic and caudal borders towards 
the distal border which is abruptly rounded. With the Macro 
centri, on the contrary, the caudal margin has almost invariably 
an angle, more or less distinctly marked, from which a long curve 
sweeps up to the apex which is near the cephalic margin. The 
submarginal vein extends out into the wing a short distance be 
hind the costa and more or less gradually joins the costa at some 
distance from the base. From the point where it joins the costa 
it becomes the marginal. It is often broken near the marginal, 
and this makes a good division of the Microcentri into two groups. 
The marginal is almost invariably longer with the Microcentri 
than with the Macrocentri. With the latter it is* sometimes en 
tirely lacking, in which case the stigmal proceeds directly from 
the submarginal {Aphycus). The postmarginal varies greatly 
in length. It may be wanting (Bntedon) or may extend 
nearly to the tip of the wing ( Gastrancistrus) . The stigmal^ 
with its club and hook, is always more strongly marked with the 
Macrocentri than with the Microcentri. With the latter the 
uncus is often represented by a chain of large cells. The spu 
rious veins are usually only seen in certain lights and are unimpor 
tant. T\\ejirst spurious connects the second with the submargi 
nal. The second spurious extends from the submarginal to a 
point below the tip of the wing. The third spurious is usually 
given off from the second, but sometimes from the first, and 
reaches the margin at a point cephalad of the second. The 
tegulcz vary from triangular to quadrilateral in shape, and vary 
also in size and color. The wings are in general evenly covered 
by a minute pilosity except at base. In certain genera (Aph- 
elinus] an oblique hairless streak, of varying width, extends from 
below the stigma to near the base of the fore wing. In certain 
Encyrtids also there is a hairless streak near the tip of the wings. 
In Trichogramma the pilosity is arranged in regular lines. The 
borders of the fore and hind wings are furnished with cilia (ex 
cept along costa) . In Psilophrys the marginal cilia are not de- 



OF WASHINGTON. 73 

veloped. In Gyrolasia they are very long. In the great major 
ity of cases the wings are clear and transparent. In many genera, 
particularly with the females, they are clouded in patches. I 
have seen but one species the wings of which are entirely clouded. 
It is allied to Smicra and is from Brazil. 

7^he legs. As a general thing the legs are rather slender and 
increase in length and size from before backwards. With the 

O 

Encyrtince and Eiipelmince, however, the middle legs are the 
longest and strongest, the hind legs ranking next. With Homa- 
lotylus the middle legs are particularly long. With the Chalcid- 
ince the hind femora are greatly enlarged and are usually (ex 
cept with Haltickella} toothed along the ventral edge. These 
huge femora are of positive inconvenience to the insects in loco 
motion and are not, as some authors state, " leaping legs." The 
coxae are free and the trochanters are apparently i -jointed. The 
front femora are often somewhat swollen in the middle and are 
furnished with a curved spur at tip. The tibiae of the other legs 
are generally of uniform width and are ordinarily provided with a 
single straight spur at tip, but sometimes have two. With the 
Encyrtince and Eupelmince the middle tibiae are lengthened and 
widened at tip and the apical end is greatly enlarged and more or 
less toothed or serrate along its tarsal edge. With Euplectrus there 
are two very long hind tibial spurs. The tarsi are 3-, 4-, or 5- 
jointed, and the groups Trimera, Tetramera, and Pentamera 
were founded on this peculiarity. The Tetracampince have fe 
males with five joints, and males with four, and upon this sub 
family Reinhart founded the group Alloemera. With the Pen 
tamera the first four joints diminish in length, the fourth being 
smallest and considerably shorter than the terminal joint which 
is furnished with two claws and a central pulvillus. The first tar- 
sal joint of the middle legs becomes strangely modified with the 
Eupelmince, less so with the Encyrtince, and still less so with 
the Aphelinince. With the first-mentioned group it is swollen 
vertically and is furnished alojig its ventral edge with a strong 
comb of chitinous teeth, represented in the other subfamilies by 
simple bristles. 

The Abdomen. 

The abdomen varies greatly in shape and relative size. Two 
extremes in shape are Omphale, in which it is very long and 



74 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

slender, and Perilampus and Eunotus, in which it is broader 
than long. It is composed of eight tergites and six visible urites. 
The first segment is the petiole, in which we find great variation. 
It may be considerably longer than the rest of the abdomen, as in 
Eucharis and Stilbula, or it may be imperceptible without mu 
tilating the specimen. The relative lengths of the different ter 
gites, especially of the second and third, are important in some 
subfamilies as generic characters. This is especially true with the 
females. In the singular subfamily Ormyrince, composed exclu 
sively of gall-parasites, the dorsum of the abdomen is remarkably 
sculptured in both sexes, whereas ordinarily it is smooth. With 
certain Torymid genera constant differences are seen with the 
hind border of the second tergite. Thus in Holaspis it is incised 
in the middle with the females only, while with Oligosthenus it 
is smooth and straight in both sexes, and with Monodontomerus 
it is somewhat incised in both sexes. It is very common for each 
of the tergites to be fringed along its posterior border with one or 
two rows of fine hair, but often also this appears to be entirely ab 
sent. The spiracles are visible (sometimes from above) at the 
sides of the seventh tergite. The last ventral segment, forming 
the ventral valves, may be ridged or smooth. The urites are al 
ways more easily seen with the males than with the females and 
often have a median carina. With the females they are often en 
tirely closed by the tergites. The ovipositor approaches more 
closely in its structure that of the Braconids than that of the Proc- 
totrupids. The two sheaths are hard and strong, semi-cylindrical, 
and usually covered with short strong bristles. The ovipositor 
proper is straight, slightly swollen at tip, pointed, with the dorsal 
edge of the apex more or less serrate. This serration is quite 
marked in the larger gall-parasites, such as Syntomaspis and 
Torymus. The ovipositor may be short and hidden, or it may 
be longer than the whole body, and between these two there is 
great variation. The penis has two rudimentary claspers at base, 
and is, so far as I have been able to ascertain, usually bipartite at 
tip. It is seldom extruded in death. In Eupelmus the cleft is 
rounded and it has rounded sides ; in Aphe.linus it is more or less 
pointed and the cleft is sharply triangular ; and in such specimens 
of Pteromalus as I have examined it is subtruncate and the cleft 
is linear. In Thoracantha it is not cleft.

Mr. Schwarz then read the following communication : 

ON THE GENUS PHYTOBIUS. The Curculionid genus Phytobius Schcen- 
herr, as restricted by more recent authors, comprises two rather rare 
European species and was introduced into our fauna because a single 
specimen had been found in 1874, in Michigan. Dr. LeConte determined 
the same as being identical with the European Ph. velatus. The genus is 
at once known by the narrow, filiform tarsi, the 3d joint not being lobed ; 
by the very long claw-joint and the very slender tarsi Every one of these 
three characters is unique in the tribe Cryptorhynchinito which the genus 
Phytobius belongs, but the same combination of the same characters recurs 
in another tribe of Curculionidse, as well as in several other widely different 
families of Coleoptera, e. g , Haliplidce, Byrrhidce, Elmidcz, Dascyllidce^ndi 
Chrysomelidce. Wherever this combination of characters occurs it points, 
so far as our experience goes, toward an aquatic or at least semi-aquatic 
mode of life, and so it does in Phytobius. But this genus is remarkable in 
being the only known really aquatic genus among the Rhynchophora, all 
other hydrophilous genera of the family, e. g., Bagous, Stenopelmus, 
Lissorhoptrus, Tanyspkyrus, Lixellus, Barilepton, etc., being more or less 
semi-aquatic only. In Phytobius the larva, pupa and imago live constantly 
under the surface of the water, the imago only coming ashore to hibernate 
under debris in very wet ground. The life-history of the genus has been 
carefully studied by Mr. Edouard Ferris, and I may be permitted to 
insert here, in translation, a short abstract from his remarks (Ann. Soc. 
Ent. de France, 1873, p. 88). Mr. Ferris found the insect in all its stages 
under water on the filiform leaves of Myriophyllum spicatum, a plant 
which is also very common in North America. " The larva does not 
differ essentially from those of the typical Curculionidae, but as in those 
species which live exposed above ground on plants, e. g., Phytonomus, 
Cionus, etc., it is covered with a viscous liquid which is insoluble in water ? 
and by means of which the larva is able to retain its position even in a 
pretty strong current. When about to transform it secretes from the 
anus a larger quantity of the gummy substance than ordinarily, or possibly 
also a different substance. This substance is spread out over the whole 
body by a peculiar movement of the segments, and finally covers the whole 



76 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

larva as a pretty thick coating which gradually dries and hardens. When 
the process of drying is completed the body of the larva detaches itself 
from the covering, and the larva finds itself inclosed in a testaceous, parch 
ment-like cocoon which is almost spherical and firmly attached between the 
leaflets to a petiole or a branch of the plant. This is all very curious, but 
still more astonishing is the faculty of the larva as well as the perfect in 
sect to live continuously submerged. The weevil is certainly too lazy and 
too poor a swimmer to come from time to time to the surface of the water 
for a fresh supply of air, and the larva without any doubt never ascends to 
the surface." 

This subaquatic mode of life is no doubt the reason that specimens of 
Phytobius are so rare in our cabinets, and I have hitherto seen only three 
specimens of Ph. velatus found in North America. Last fall, however, 
Mr. Hubbardand myself were fortunate enough to find, near Detroit, Mich., 
a number of specimens hibernating in moist ground on the banks of the 
Riviere Rouge, which at that locality is filled with Myriophyllum, and I 
exhibit herewith some of them. In comparing them with the descriptions 
of the two known species of Phytobius, I found that the species before you 
differs structurally in many details and notably in the absence of thoracic 
spines and tubercles. When alive the species is one of the handsomest 
Curculionids known to me; its underside is snow-white, the upperside of 
a silky-gray, and the yellow patches of scales on thorax and elytra of the 
brightest sulphur-yellow. In'spite of all precautions in killing and mount 
ing the specimens, the colors gradually faded away and the specimens 
have now lost every trace of their original beauty. 

Since there are in our collections many undescribed species of the tribe 
Ceutorhynchini, the naming and describing of this new Phytobius would 
be rather inopportune at this place, and is better deferred until the whole 
tribe or family can be synoptically revised. 

Mr. Schwarz also read a note on the secondary sexual char 
acters of the North American species of Anaspis, of which the 
following is an abstract : 

There is great discrepancy in the descriptions of these characters. Dr. 
LeConte (Proc. Ac. Nat. Sc. Phil., 1862, p. 44) says: " In the male two 
long, slender appendages are seen proceeding from between the fourth and 
fifth ventral segments ; the fourth and fifth and sometimes the others are lon 
gitudinally excavated." Mr. J. B. Smith (Trans. Amer. Entom. Soc., x, 
1882, p. 77) quotes the above remarks of Dr. LeConte and adds : " I mustad- 
mit, however, that I have been entirely unable to discover these processes, 
although I have examined hundreds of specimens of A. rufa to this end 
alone. Males I have found with the excavated ventral segment, but never 
the processes." It seems strange that there should be such difference of 
opinion regarding this character in our Anaspt's, which by no means 
rank among the smallest Coleoptera, but the superficial appearance of 
this structure is, indeed, a most deceptive one. As Mr. Smith correctly 



OF WASHINGTON. 77 

says, one can examine many males, and in all the abdomen appears to be 
excavated, the excavation extending in an elongate-triangular shape from 
the apex of the fourth segment to the tip of the abdomen. Such will be 
found to be the case in most specimens which have been collected in 
alcohol, but in well preserved specimens there should be no doubt about 
the real nature of this structure, which can be described brieflv as follows : 
Two more 'or less slender, movable appendages arise from the apex of the 
fourth ventral segment; the abdomen is not excavated, but the last segment 
is emarginate, or notched. The appendages are stiff, of nearly equal width 
throughout, covered with rather sparse, black hair, and movable in an up- 
and downward direction, but do not seem to be capable of lateral movement. 
When closely applied to the surface of the abdomen they resemble in an 
extraordinary degree the abrupt ridges which in the males of certain other 
Coleoptera limit the excavation of the abdomen. In three species (M. 
nigra, atra and flavipennis} the appendages are straight or nearly so, and 
start from one and the same point at the apex of the fourth segment, diverg 
ing posteriorly; while in M. rufa the appendages are curved and widely 
distant at their starting place. Of the remaining species no males could 
be examined. 

Mr. Schwarz then read the following note : 

STRIDULATION IN HARPALUS CALIGINOSUS. I inquired of Dr. Horn, 
while he was in Washington on a recent visit, concerning his observation 
(alluded to on p. 51), and he told me that there can be no doubt regarding 
the stridulating power of Harpalus caliginosus. One evening his attention 
was called by some apparently large insect flying against his window, and 
on opening the same he was disappointed in seeing that it was only a 
specimen of this Harpalus -which -was noiv quietly resting on the window 
sill in the bright glare of the electric light near by. While looking at the 
specimen he distinctly heard the stridulating noise, and at the same time 
he plainly saw that the noise was produced by the beetle moving its abdo 
men up and down against the inner edge of the wing-cases. 

In view of this observation the reason of the failure of both Mr. Smith's 
and my own efforts to hear the stridulations in H. caliginosus becomes at 
once apparent ; for we expected to hear the noise while handling the speci 
mens, and from our experience we were correct in stating that the Harpalus 
does not stridulate while being so handled. In Coleoptera sound-produc 
ing apparatus are generally but little developed, but occur in several widely 
different families. They are present in Carabidce, Dytiscidce, Hydro- 
philidcE* Lucanidce, Scarabczidce, Ckrysomelidce, Curculionidce and An- 
thribidce. In each of these families, and no doubt also in others, we find 
a smaller or larger number of genera, or single species, which possess 
stridulating powers. But .in all these stridulating Coleoptera the sound is 
always heard when the specimen is handled, or when it feels approach 
ing danger, or when it is otherwise in a state of unusual excitement, e. g., 
during the act of copulation. Our Har^aius caliginosus appears to make 



78 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

a remarkable exception from this rule, and it remains for observers to 
ascertain whether or not other species of Harpalus, or species of other 
genera in Carabidce, participate in this habit.

Article III of the Constitution as amended stands, therefore, as 
follows : 

SECTION I. The Society shall consist of active, corresponding, 
and honorary members. Active members must be residents of 
the cities of Washington or Baltimore or vicinity. Corresponding 
or honorary members may be from any State or country. 

SECTION II. Any active member of the Society, in good stand 
ing, who may leave the cities or district above named to reside 
for a year or more elsewhere, may, on motion of any active mem 
ber of the Society, or at his own request, be transferred to the list 
of corresponding members, and shall from that time have the 
privileges of such members only. 

SECTION III. Candidates for active membership may be pro 
posed at any stated meeting by any active member, but shall not be 
elected until the next following meeting except upon motion of 
some person other than the proposer, and upon unanimous con 
sent of those present. A two-thirds' vote of the active members 
present shall be required to elect an active member. 

Corresponding members, except such as become such by re 
moval, may be proposed in the same way as active members, but 
the name must be referred to the Executive Committee, who shall 
at the next meeting report upon the same. A two-thirds' vote of 
the active members present shall be required to elect. 

Honorary members shall be proposed only by the Executive 
Committee, and may be elected at any stated meeting without 
lying over as in the case of active members. A unanimous vote 
of the active members present is required to elect. 

The election of active or corresponding members may be by

ballot or viva voce. Honorary members shall be elected by ballot 
only. 

Mr. J. D. Sherman, Jr., of Peekskill, N. Y., sent the follow 
ing communication : 

COLEOPTEROLOGICAL NOTES FOR THE YEAR l886. CyckrUS SteilOStomuS 

was found several times under fungi where, I suppose, it had stationed 
itself in order to feed upon the insects inhabiting the fungus. 

Amara imptincticollis is found on Lepidium virginicum during the 
warmer parts of the day in May ; whether or not it feeds on the plant 
I am not certain. 

Lebia pulchella was found under stones on May 18 and October 8. 

Cercyon prcetextatum and Silpha americana were found in fungi. 

The following Coccinellidce are found on Asclepias cornuti : Hippo- 
damia glacialis, convergens, parenthesis, Coccinella novemnotata, Adalia 
bipunctata, Brachyacantha ursina. 

Dermestes caninus in a vacated bird's nest. 

Cryptorhopalum triste, common on Taraxacum dens-leonis, in May. 

Cryptarcha strigata, in fungi where Pocadius hel-jolus is common, also 
on bruised pears, in September. 

Tenebrioides corticalis and Adelocera discoidea common under the bark 
of dead Pitch pines (Pimis rigida}, where, on February 10, I secured a 
single specimen of Dicerca punctulata. 

Acmceodera culta common on Taraxacum in May. 

Oxyomus porcatus common in dried horse manure in April. 

Both sexes of Geotrupes splendidus I found in a smooth-surfaced, nearly 
round cavity situated at the bottom of a winding hole some three or four 
inches deep, which communicated with the interior of the stem of a fungus; 
with them I found a pupa, which no doubt belongs to this species. 

The species of Trox fly in the hot sunshine in April (T. monachus and 
uni^triatus), are attracted by light at night (T. terrestrisz.\\& unistriatus), 
and are found in filth (T. terrestris, or allied species). 

Macrodactylus subspinosus was unusually uncommon on the rose, doing 
but little damage ; nevertheless it was as abundant as ever on the Ox-eye 
daisy. 

Molorchus bimaculatus, common on Viburnum prunifolium during the 
latter part of May. 

Colaspis brunnea abundant on Ambrosia artemisi&folia. 

Mr. Smith called attention to a peculiarity observed by him 
in the antennae of Cressonia juglandis. They have in the male 
two branches to each side of each joint, precisely as in the Satur- 
niidae. This feature is unique in the Sphingidae of North America ; 
nor did he know of its occurrence in exotic genera. He empha 
sized the relation of the Smerinthids to the Bombycids, even 



80 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

though the venation of the wings and the larvae are essentially 
sphingiform.* 

Mr. Smith also stated that he had found that among the insects 
usually named Euerysthia phasma, two species were embraced 
which differed decidedly, not only in markings, but in structure. f 

Mr. Smith also offered some remarks on the North American 
species of Callimorpha. In arranging the material of the U. S. 
National Museum he had come to the conclusion, from a study 
of the series of Callimorpha in the collection, that most of those 
forms now marked as varieties were really good species. He 
said that, at some future time, he would present a careful study 
of the forms. | 

Mr. Schwarz presented the following list of Scolytids found by 
him on Pinus inops, in the vicinity of Washington : Gnatho- 
trichus materiarius, asperulus, Pityophthorus sparsus^pullus, 
hirticeps, puberulus, Hypothenemus dissimilis, Xyloterus 
bivittatus (probably imported from farther north), Xyleborus 
pubescens, ccelatus, Dryoccetes affaber, Tomicus calligraphus, 
cacographus, pini, Carphoborus bifurcus, Dendroctonus tere- 
brans, Hylastes porcuhis, tenuis* Hylurgops pinifex. The 
mode of work of many of these still remains unknown. Among 
the less common species is Pityophthorus pullus, the galleries 
of which were exhibited and explained. The female beetle (or 
both sexes ?) constructs under the bark of the trunk a rather large, 
round or oval central chamber, from which from three to five long 
and slightly undulating galleries lead off in various directions, but 
usually more or less upwards or downwards. The larval galleries 
do not present any particular features, but are rather shorter than 
in allied species. All these galleries are more within the bark 
than in the outermost layer of wood.

Mr. Schwarz read a paper entitled " In Memoriam of Thomas 
Say." After briefly narrating the circumstances of Say's removal 
from Philadelphia to New Harmony, Ind., and the death of the 
great naturalist at the latter place, he continued as follows : 

Until very recently I was quite ignoi'ant of the fact that the last resting 
place of the " Father of American Entomology " was still recognizable or 
even marked by a monument. Some time last winter, however, I learned 
from Mr. C. Fleischmann, of this City, that during a few months' stay at 
New Harmony, he had every day the opportunity of looking from his win 
dow at the grave of Thomas Say. I begged Mr. Fleischmann for further 
particulars, and through his kindness I have come into possession of two 
photographs of the monument, which I. herewith exhibit, and of a copy of 
the inscriptions thereon. 

At New Harmony, Thomas Say lived and died in the house built by 
William Maclure, president of the Philadelphia Academy of Sciences, the 
life-long friend and adviser of Say, and the leading spirit in the New Har 
mony colonization scheme. His house, a very stately building, was after 
Say's death occupied by Alexander Maclure, the brother of William, and 
is now owned by a Mrs. Owen, the widow of the son of one of the founders 
of New Harmony. It occupies one street corner in the centre of the present 
little town of New Harmony, and in the garden, which extends from the 
house through the entire block to the next street, is the grave of Say, 
about fifty yards distant from the rear porch of the house. The grave is 
marked by a mound about three feet high, from which the monument arises, 
and surrounded by handsome trees, thus forming a very conspicuous ob 
ject. From the inscription on the west side we learn that the monument 
was erected in the year 1846 (12 years after Say's death) by Alexander 
Maclure in the name of his deceased brother William. It is of white 
marble, about six feet in height, of the quadrangular form still frequently 
seen in our cemeteries, and surmounted by a vase. It is quite imposing, al 
though not a great success as a work of art. The photographs represent 
the east and north sides of the monument, which even after a lapse of 40 
years appears to be in an excellent state of preservation. 

The following inscriptions, which are incised on the four sides of the 
monolith which forms the middle piece of the monument, do not need any 
comment further than to state that the signature " A. M.," on the west in 
scription, means Alexander Maclure :

Mr. Smith gave a brief review of specific characters in the 
genus Arctia, criticising the recent papers by Hulst, Neumoegen 
and Grote on the subject, and pointed out certain features in macu- 
lation which, in his experience, form constant and reliable specific 
characters.* 

Mr. Ulke made some remarks in regard to the exchange and 
sale of insects. He contended, that exchanges had the tendency 
to make collectors careless, and that these became more interested 
in possessing numbers of the check list than species. The ex 
changes, facilitated by the check lists, added nothing to the ento 
mological knowledge of the persons engaged therein. He had 
received large numbers of species to be named by him, and he 
invariably found that the majority of names obtained by exchange 
were wrong. The sale of insects in his opinion was even worse, 
many collectors actually forming a corner in some local or showy 
species. He further claimed that dealing in insects had the ten 
dency to produce cheating and to give wrong localities. Mr. 
Smith contended that exchange between collectors was the only 
means by which beginners could hope to ever obtain sufficient 
material to enable them to study their favorite group.

by him at the September, 1886, meeting of the Society. He had 
visited Rock Creek on May i, 1887, an d found the larvae in all 
stages of growth, just as he had found them the previous August. 
He thought that the species remained at least two years in the 
larval state. 

Mr. Smith gave a brief review of the classification of the Smer- 
inthince from the date of the creation of the genus Smerinthus by 
Latreille, showing how and on what characters it had been divided 
and subdivided, and explaining the characters used by the various 
authors. He criticised the most recent production of Mr. Grote 
on the subject, showing that Mr. Grote really worked in the dark 
and without any very distinct idea of what limitations to set to his 
genera. Except myops, every American species of the subfamily 
has been made a distinct generic type. He also gave a brief de 
scription of the genital structure of the group which here, as else 
where, gave valuable information as to the location of species. 
His arrangement, of which he gave a brief definition, would be as 
follows :

Mr. Lugger presented a sketch of an entomologist, met by him 
many years ago in Detroit, Mich. , in which he described the unique 
collection made by that gentleman, and the method adopted by him 
to combine business and pleasure.* 

Dr. Marx spoke about the North American species of scorpions, 
of which about fourteen are known. He said the study of these 
animals was made very difficult on account of the poor descrip 
tions by former authors and the numerous synonyms, which 
were very perplexing. The species known as Buthus carolini- 
anus, for instance, is neither a Buthus nor is it carolinianus.

Mr. Lugger referred to a statement by Dr. Hamilton, in the 
Canadian^itomologist (vol. xix, 1887, p. 64), in regard to the 
habit of Cloeotus aphodioides. Dr. Hamilton found these beetles 
in cavities in the bark of a small dead tree, in which the bark had 
not yet become separated from the wood. Dr. Hamilton thought 
these beetles had sought the old burrows of some other wood- 
boring beetle to hibernate. Mr. Lugger said that he had fre 
quently bred these beetles from their eggs, and had also found 
them in all stages in situ, viz., under the bark of dead trees, 
where they found food in the decaying material. It is very 
likely that the specimens found by Dr. Hamilton did not enter 
these holes to hibernate, but rather had made them to leave the 
place of their birth.

Mr. Smith gave in brief the characters of a new Arctiid genus, 
which he proposes to call Cerathosia. The only species, C. tri 
color, has the appearance of a Lithosiid, but is Arctiid in char 
acter.* 

Dr. Marx spoke on the Arachnid fauna of the District of Co 
lumbia. He is preparing a list of the local fauna, and possesses 
already about 200 species found in the vicinity of Washington. 

Dr. Riley mentioned the peculiar fact that, in some instances, 
where trees have been enfeebled from other causes, spiders can 
prove quite injurious to them. Young elms in his grounds, re 
cently transplanted, had been covered with spider-webs to such 
an extent as to prevent normal growth, and the spiders showed a 
great predilection for such in comparison with vigorous trees. 

Mr. Luebeck, of Philadelphia, spoke on the habits of Diccelus 
dilatatus. The beetle feeds, like the genus Cychrus, upon snails. 
In a number of instances he found the Dicaelus with the head in 
serted in the shells of Helix alternata, eating the enclosed snail. 

Dr. Riley exhibited various specimens, and made remarks 
thereon as follows :

NOTES ON THE LIFE-HABITS OF ^EGERIID.E.- A specimen of Melittia 
gloriosa Hy. Edw., from San Diego, Cal., the food-habits of which, so far 
as I know, are not yet recorded, though the moth itself has been found 
flying around cucurbitaceous plants by Mr. Edwards, and it was naturally 
inferred that the larva might live, like its congener, M. cucurbits, in the 
roots of these plants. This species, however, was reared by Mr. F. E. 
Blasedale from the roots of Rhus laurina. The pupal exuvium shows that 
the spines are more strongly marked than in any other ^Egerian with 
which I am acquainted, the frontal thorns being noticeably strong, and re 
calling the same parts in the larger Asilidce and Anthracidce. 

j&Lgeria impropria Hy. Edw. (specimens of imago, larva and pupa) is 
injurious, in the larval state, to strawberries in southern California. I 
have, for some years, known of great injury to strawberry roots by some 
borer of a Lepidopterous character, but the species had remained undeter 
mined. as I had been unable to obtain specimens. As soon as I had an 
opportunity of examining some strawberry plants on the plantation of 
Mr. I. V. Wilcox, of Santa Clara, Cal., it was evident that the larva belonged 
to the ^geriidce. The larva of impropria has been hitherto unknown 
and the name may be said, paradoxically, to be quite proper, and yet quite 
improper; for Mr. Edwards had also described a species of SEgcria by the 
name of fragarice, the larva of which was not yet known, though Mr. Ed 
wards informs me that it was found on the flowers of strawberry. The 
bred material shows that impropria is very variable in colorational mark 
ings of the body. % ' 

A third sEgeriid exhibited is the very pretty Phemonoe ^-caudata Rid 
ings, the larva of which I have received from Dr. J. C. Neal, of Archer, 
Fla., who found it boring in the root of a grafted Japan Persimmon. The 
imago issued April n, 1887. I also exhibit specimens of Sciapteron 
rob'inice from Los Angeles county, Cal., reared from larvae boring in Salix 
californica ; also specimens of ^Egeria albicornis Hy. Edw. from southern 
California, reared from larvse boring under the bark of Salix californica. 
An interesting fact connected with this last species is that the type is from 
Centre, N. Y., where the larva is not known; so that the species occurs 
on both coasts. 

Finally, a specimen of the very small sEgeria pyri Harr. , bred at the 
Department of Agriculture from apple, is included. 

COLOR-VARIATION IN THE LARVA OF AGRAULIS VANILL/E. I would also 
call attention to an interesting variation which I noticed at Los Angeles 
in the coloration of the larva of Agraulis vanillce. The eastern form of 
this larva is generally reddish or vinous-brown in color, with an indica 
tion of two darker longitudinal rays, as my notes and preserved material, 
and the figures by Smith and Abbott and the older authors show. Those 

O J 

found at Los Angeles were very striking by virtue of the general color 
being of a bright leaden blue or pale indigo-blue, with a broad bright lat 
eral cream-colored stripe more or less diversified with ferruginous, the 
head distinctly marked with vertical pale vittae and with a pale crown

MISCELLANEOUS INSECTS. I also exhibit a number of alcoholic speci 
mens of the larva and pupa, as also a mounted imago of the brilliant 
black, green and rust-red Lepidopteron, Eumenia atala Poey, recently 
collected by Mr. Schwarz at Cocoanut Grove, Fla., on Zamia integrifolia. 
The insect, on account of its brilliancy and its bright reddish larva, has 
been frequently treated of. I also exhibit another Lepidopteron a Noct- 
uid received from Mr. Schwarz, viz., Cloantha derupta Morr. , the larva 
of which Mr. Schwarz found upon Egg plant in southeastern Florida. It 
is interesting because of the great general resemblance which the larva 
bears to that of Laphygma frugiperda. 

Finally, I would present specimens of a new genus, Dendrotettix, 
family Acrididcz. I had reared the species which formed the type of the 
genus many years ago in Missouri in all its stages, and propose to describe 
it under the specific name of quercus. The peculiarity of the genus is that, 
as far as we know, it is essentially tree-inhabiting. 

Dr. Riley also read the following paper : 

FURTHER NOTES ON PHENGODES AND ZARHIPIS. 

By DR. C. V. RILEY. 

I exhibit herewith some further larvae of Zarhipis and its female. As 
compared with Phengodes this Zarhipis larva is somewhat more depressed, 
more parallel-sided, the thoracic joints less attenuated, and the pro-thoracic 
joint is more particularly shorter and transverse. When immature the 
color is pale, with but little brown, but when full grown the color becomes 
darker brown, and the general aspect, when the larva is stretched and 
active, is one that recalls the Myriapods upon which it feeds. The dead 
and dry specimens convey but a poor idea of the real form, as in life the 
larva can stretch to more than two inches in length and crawls easily and 
rapidly. The structure of the head is essentially similar but differs notably 
in the following particulars : The head itself is broader and more trans 
verse, with the jaws broader and apparently more strongly elbowed near 
base. The antennae have a very strong bulbus and are three-jointed, as in 
Phengodes; the nipple or terminal joint being stronger and the second 
joint being more often elbowed on the basil, *'. e., directed more outward ; 
the joints are also somewhat stouter and shorter than in Phengodes. All 
the other trophi are similar to those of Phengodes, but broader and 
shorter; the maxillary palpi diverging more just as do the antennas. 
There are a few very strong bristles around the head, one near the front 
and one just behind the antennae being particularly noticeable. The sur 
face of the body is somewhat more distinctly shagreened than in Phen 
godes. The medio-dorsal depression the whole length of the body is 
stronger, and in the pale specimens the brown on the superior surface 
leaves a similar medio-dorsal spot each side this line near the base of each 
joint, just as in the paler specimens of Phengodes. 

I had the good fortune of seeing three of these larvae alive while in Cal- 



OF WASHINGTON. 87 

ifornia, last April. One of them had been found December, 1885, by Mr. 
A. Koebele, who had kept it in a jar of earth with dead leaves. It died while 
I was there, in April, 1887, having remained motionless and without food 
for nearly fifteen months. The second was in Mr. Rivers's possession^nd 
had shed its larval skin on April 2, 1887. This Mr. Rivers kindly gave 
me. and it shed its skin again April 18, and it is more particularly to this 
brief period of about two weeks that I wish to call attention because it rep 
resents a stage of development hitherto insufficiently characterized, and 
which may be likened to the pupa state. It is in reality a pseudo-pupal 
condition, the insect being neither larva nor imago During this brief 
period the color is pale, there is no disposition to move, and the mouth- 
parts are more soft and undeveloped; the joints of antennae and palpi are 
less distinctly formed and shorter, while the jaws proper are reduced to 
little more than useless tubercles. The perfect, larviform female, after 
shedding this pseudo-pupal skin (which differs from the other shed skins 
in being pale and more delicate), becomes darker again and in general ap 
pearance much more like the full grown larva before it entered the pseudo- 
pupal condition. The color in the adult is uniformly dark brown above 
and much darker beneath than in the larva. In short, the perfect female 
is more strongly chitinized throughout, while the mouth parts are also 
darker and stronger, with more bristles, and the mandibles more distinctly 
elbowed and longer. The third specimen was given to me by Mrs. A. E. 
Bush, of San Jose, and. though not fully grown, died and became shrunken 
and rigid within a week in the box of dry earth in which I carried it while 
travelling. 

The second specimen, from Mr. Rivers, was placed in a large jar with 
earth and placed where the male might reach it, and on April 25 had at 
tracted a male. She subsequently laid eggs. These are spherical, 1.8-2 
mm. in diameter, with occasionally an irregular impression no doubt caused 
by external pressure. Color yellowish-white when fresh, turning grad 
ually tq dirty yellow. Tolerably shining and with no sculpture visible.

remarks upon them : 

NOTES ON THE EVERSIBLE GLANDS IN LARVvE OF ORGYIA AND PAR- 

ORGYIA, WITH NOTES ON THE SYNONYMY OF SPECIES. Dr. A. S Pack 
ard has called attention (Am. Nat... 1886, page 314) to the fact that the 
two coral-red tubercles on the back of joints 9 and 10 in the larva of Or- 
gyia leucostigma are in reality eversible glands, similar to that previously 
found by Mr. E. R. Poulton (Trans. Ent. Soc., Lond., 1886, page 16) on 
the loth joint of the European Orgyia pudibunda. 



00 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

I have long known of the eversible nature of these protuberances, and 
observed them first in 1873 on the larvae of Parorgyia clintonii Grote. In 
my descriptive notes of this species, made June 4, 1873, I referred to these 
glands on the middle of the back of joints 9 and 10 of the larva, comment 
ing on their curious character and on their recalling in function the osma- 
terium of Papilio larvae; also to the fact that they are coral-red and with 
out apparent odor. Later observations led me to believe that this note was 
inaccurate as to the odor, and that all larvae of both Orgyia and Parorgyia 
possess these tubercles, and that they are really scent-organs, like the 
osmaterium in Papilio. I have noticed quite a strong odor from those of 
Orgyia, and, in fact, a fine spray of liquid is sometimes thrown from them. 

I exhibit blown larvae of the European O. pudibunda and of Orgyia an- 
tiqua. This last species also occurs in this country, our specimens being 
somewhat smaller, on the average, than those of Europe. This larva 
shows two crimson-red eversible tubercles. 

I also exhibit, in addition to the common Orgyia leucostigma, blown 
specimens of O. gulosa Hy. Edw. and O. vetusta Bd., both of which I re 
cently observed living in California, and both of which have the same 
crimson-red organs, and have been reared to the imago by Mr Koebele. 

I also exhibit blown larvae of a Parorgyia, which, from the bred speci 
mens, I believe to be P. leucophcea Smith & Abbott. I have bred one 
male of this from the larva feeding on Persimmon. In an endeavor to 
determine my bred material in this genus, I have concluded that there are 
fewer species than have been made by Lepidopterists. The imagos vary 
considerably in details of coloration and markings, and it is quite prob 
able that obliquata will prove to be synonymous with leucophcea. The 
larva, as figured by Smith and Abbott, is probably misleading, in having 
the dorsal tufts too conspicuously shown on joints 8, 9, and 10, for in my 
specimens they have been, as in other species of this genus, large and 
conspicuous on joints 4, 5, 6, and 7, inclusive, but far less so on the other 
joints. 9 

I also exhibit various blown larvae of Parorgyia clintonii Gr. These 
vary in the color of the tufts according to state of growth, and there is also 
individual variation. My original specimens were found feeding on Honey 
Locust, but I have also found it on various other plants, as wild plum, elm, 
etc. Both these Parorgyia larvae show the same eversible glands, though 
they are less conspicuous than in Orgyia, on account of the greater den 
sity of the hairs surrounding them. As to the synonymy of this species, 
my experience with the adolescent states leaves little doubt that clintonii 
is a synonym of achatina Sm. & Abb., and I question whether, with more 
complete knowledge, parallela and basiftava and even cinnamomea will 
not prove synonymous with the same species. 

FURTHER REMARKS ON PHENGODES. In connection with the remarks 
made at a previous meeting, I also exhibit a female of Phengode.s laticollis 
received from Prof. Geo. F. Atkinson, of the University of North Caro 
lina. This is an undoubted female, having attracted the male and laid 



OF WASHINGTON. 89 

eggs, some of which also accompany the specimens. It agrees in every 
respect with my original figure published in LeBaron's fourth report on the 
insects of Illinois, and is distinguishable from the larva by its smaller 
jaws, and smaller, finer ungues. 

INTERESTING LEPIDOPTERA. I also call attention to a very pretty species 
of Syntomeida with metallic green wings and steel blue abdomen, tipped 
with ferruginous red, and with large white spots on the body, collected bv 
Mr. Schwarz at Cocoanut Grove, Biscayne Bay, Fla. It will doubtless 
prove to be a new species. 

Also specimens of another interesting, silvery white moth, the position 
of which is not very clear, and which Mr. Schwarz also collected. The 
interest attaching to them is that long strings or pencils of hair are seen 
to issue from the tip of the body made by the death movement of the ovi 
positor separating and welding the hairs from a conspicuous anal tuft 
which the female possesses. 

Mr. Schwarz commenced an account of a recent trip through 
the coral region of southeastern Florida, and narrated his expe 
rience during a short stay, in the month of April, on the island of 
Key West. The following is an abstract of his remarks : 

The island of Key West, extending in a west-easterly direction, has a 
length of from six to seven miles, with a width of from one to two miles. 
The western third of the island is occupied by the city of Key West, and 
the trees in the gardens and on the streets are all artificially imported 
from the West Indies or South America. A. rather wide beach, partly 
rocky and partly sandy, extends all along the south side ; the north side 
is without beach and covered with a dense growth of mangrove trees, or 
rather bushes, which extend also in a wide belt along the south side back 
of the beach. The middle of the island is occupied by an extremely thick 
growth of shrub-like trees, not higher than about 15 feet, but without much 
undergrowth. This shrubbery represents what is known as the semi- 
tropical forest of southern Florida, and its low growth on Key West and 
the other smaller Keys is no doubt attributable to the small elevation of 
the land above the level of the sea. There is a complete absence of fresh 
water springs, creeks, and swamps, and consequently, the Dytiscidae and 
all other families living in or near fresh water are not represented on the 
island. The ground is either rocky or covered with coralline sand, and 
since the porous rock absorbs at once every drop of the frequent showers, 
the surface of the ground is constantly dry. The few herbaceous plants 
growing in the woods or on the open places are all of a maritime character. 

The whole aspect of the island is, entomologically speaking, by no 
means inviting, and my first attempts in collecting resulted in disappoint 
ment. It took some time before I found out that, owing to the extreme 
dryness, collecting under stones, and sifting the old leaves and other debris 
in the woods, produce hardly anything, and the sparse vegetation of herb 
aceous plants also harbors a very scant fauna of no special interest. On 



90 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

the beach 16 species of Coleoptera were found, of which number only 3 
(a Trickopteryx, an unknown Aleocharid, and Blapstinus opacus) do not 
seem to occur north of Cape Florida. The bulk of the fauna is represented 
by the species living in or on the trees of the semi-tropical forest. There 
is, therefore, on the island of Key West (and, I may add, also on the other 
Keys and on the shores of Biscayne Bay, south of Miami river), a very strik 
ing scarcity of predaceous, rhypophagous, and coprophagous Coleoptera 
and an equally striking preponderance of certain phytophagous families. 
Among the latter, the Rhynchophora are by far the best represented fam 
ily in the number of species as well as specimens; the Cerambycidce fol 
low next; the Pttnidce occupy the third place ; the various bark-inhabiting 
families of the Clavicornia are fairly represented, while the Rlateridce, 
Buprestidce, phyllophagous Scarabceidce&nd Chrysomelidce are represented 
only by a very small number of species. 

During a stay of five days on the island the whole of which time could 
not be devoted to entomological excursions 129 species were found living 
in or on the forest trees. An analysis of this fauna shows that 36 species 
thereof are of general distribution in the more southern portion of the 
United States ; 70 are not found north of Florida, and 52 represent the 
" semitropical fauna." Of Rhynchophora 36 species were found ; of Ceram 
bycidce 18, and otPtinidce 13 species. Of the whole number, more than one- 
fourth are species hitherto not known to occur in the United States. Some 
are no doubt undescribed, but since the food-plants are all, or nearly all, of 
West Indian origin, most of the species are either described from the West 
Indies or will no doubt be found to occur in that region. 

Before adjournment the following shorter communications were 
made : Dr. Riley spoke on the large collection of American Cole 
optera of the late Mr. G. D. Smith, of Boston, Mass., which is 
still offered for sale ; Mr. Ulke, on the peculiar features of the col 
lecting season of the present year ; Mr. Schwarz, on the great 
usefulness of naphthaline in preserving and protecting collections 
of insects in the South ; and Mr. Howard related the wanton de 
struction by children of Wheel-bugs (Prionidus cristatus} and 
their larvae which had stationed themselves on a fence to inter 
cept the Hyphantria larvae crawling along the fence. 



AUGUST 4, 1887. 

Seven persons present. President Howard in the chair. 

Dr. Marx made some additional remarks regarding the types of 
the Scorpionida described by Wood. As stated at a former 
meeting (see p. 64) ten of these are preserved in the U. S. Na- 



OF WASHINGTON. 91 

tional Museum. The remaining three he had believed were lost, 
but during a recent visit to Philadelphia he succeeded in finding 
two of them in the collection of the Academy of Natural Sciences. 
This discovery enables him to correctly place in the recent system 
all but one of Wood's species as follows : 

1. Buthus biaculeatus = Centrurus biaculeatus Lucas. 

2. Buthus boreus = Vejovis boretis Girard. 
3 Buthus Californicus = Centrurus vittatus Say. 

4. Buthus Carolinianus = Centrurus vittatus Say. 

5. Buthus emarginaticeps = Hadrurus emarginaticeps W.* 

6. Buthus eustheneura = ? (type lost). 

7. Buthus exilicauda = Centrurus exilicauda W. 

8. Buthus hirsutus = Hadrurus hirsutus W. (Thorell). 

9. Buthus Lesueurii = Diploc-entrus Lesueurii G. 
10. Buthus punctipalpi = Vejovis punctipalpis W. 
u. Buthus spinigerus = Vejovis spiniger W. 

12. Centrurus phreodactylus = Uroctonus phaeodactylus W. 

13. Scorpio Allenii = Broteas Allenii W. 

Mr. Smith exhibited a section of Abies Douglasi, from Cali 
fornia, with the burrows of a Longicorn beetle, Notorhina aspera, 
and read a letter from Mr. L. E. Ricksecker in regard to the ovipo- 
sition of this species. 

Mr. Howard spoke on retardation in the development of Bom- 
bycidce. He instanced European cases of such retardation, and 
narrated that in October, 1885, two cocoons of Samia cecropia 
were received by a lady friend of his. About two months ago 
these cocoons were cut open, and the pupa? were still alive, so 
that the imagos would probably not appear before next year. 

In discussing this communication, Mr. Smith stated that a re 
tardation of one year has frequently been observed in most of our 
large Saturniidce and in many Sphingidce. Mr. Ashmead said 
that he had kept a Cynipid gall for two years, and the larva? therein 
were still alive ; application of water speedily brought the flies out. 
Dr. Marx mentioned another case of retardation in Argiope basil 
ica, the eggs of which, collected in 1882, did not hatch until four 
years afterwards. 

Mr. Howard then read a paper, of which he has prepared the 
following abstract : 

ON ENCYRTUS MONTINUS PACK. This Parasite was described by Packard 

* This is probably only a mutilated specimen of Hadrurus hirsutus. 



92 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

in his paper entitled " Some Ichneumon Parasites of New England Butter 
flies." and has since been considered as a parasite of the White Mountain 
butterfly (Chionobas semtdea}. Recently, however, the type specimen 
has come temporarily into my possession through Mr. Scudder, and I find 
that the only authority for such consideration is the old label which reads : 
" Found alive in an old chrysalis case of semtdea." An additional label 
credits the collecting to Mr. Sanborn. Study of the specimen shows that 
the species belongs to the chalcostomus group of the genus Encyrtus, ap 
proaching very closely to E. lunatus Dal. It has no connection with 
E. su'ederi Dal. with which Dr. Packard compares it, and which belongs 
to Comys. All of the chalcostomus group, including lunatus, are parasites 
of Coccidse, the only exceptions being barbarus and Rogenhoferi, the 
habits of which are not known. Moreover all are parasites of the genus 
Lecanium. No true Encyrtus is known in Europe to have been bred from 
a Lepidopteron, and no species of the subfamily Encyrtinse from any di 
urnal. Encyrtus bucculatricis How. is the only American exception to the 
former rule. 

From these facts it seems to me extremely improbable that E. montinus 
is a parasite of C. semtdea, but rather that the occurrence of the type speci 
men in the old empty chrysalis case was entirely an accident and that it 
had issued in all probability from some neighboring Lecanium. The type 
specimen is a female and not a male as stated by Dr. Packard. 

Mr. Smith spoke on the structural features of the Sphingida3. 
He compared the general type of genital structure with that of 
other families, finding here a universal existence of a peculiar 
supra-anal process, which takes on more or less of a claw-like 
form, very different from the ordinary simple curved hook of 
most families, or even the double hooks of some Bombycids. He 
showed a tendency to abnormity in certain species and a curious 
lack of agreement in other details of genital structure in species 
of the same genus. 

The peculiar structure of Dilophonota was explained. Here 
there are two superior plates, both furcate, but the curvature of 
the forks are not coincident. Several other features of genital 
structure were pointed out, and drawings of these structures in 
nearly all the American species were exhibited. 

The armature of the tarsi in some of the genera was discussed 
and explained, as well as the peculiarities of the venation of the 
family. The classification of the Macroglossincz was briefly touched 
on, as was the relationship of the family with some Bombycid fami 
lies. Mr. Smith thinks that there are two distinct leads into or from 
the Bombycids, the Smerinthince being more closely related to the 



OF WASHINGTON. \ 93 

Saturniidce, while the Sphingidce are allied rather to the Ptilo- 
donts. He gave a brief history of classification, with the special 
view of demonstrating the error of English and many American 
authors in the use of the term Sesia, and, finally, remarked on some 
of BoisduvaPs descriptions of Sphingidcz from drawings and the 
difficulty of positive identification. 

Mr. Schwarz made the following additional remarks on the 
Coleopterous fauna of Key West : 

The Mangrove belt which encircles the island is composed chiefly of 
three species of tree-like shrubs, the Black Mangrove {Avizennia nitida), 
the White Mangrove {iMguncularia racemosa}, and the Buttonwood 
(Conocarpus erecta}. Thk last is the only food-plant of Chrysobothris 
impretsa * which would be greatly destructive if the wood would serve 
any other use besides fuel and the manufacture of charcoal. C hry sob ot hr is 
ckryscela is also extremely common in this tree, besides several species of 
Leptostylus, among them argentatus. Elaphidion cinereum and Neoclytus 
devastator also develop in the branches of Conocarpus, but are not con 
fined to that tree. The last-named species is one of the most common in 
sects on Key West and breeds in all sorts of the harder forest trees. On 
the Black Mangrove I never was able to find any insect whatever, except 
a Cecidomyious gall on the leaves. The White Mangrove is the food-plant 
of Elaphidion irroratum. This species occurs in North America, in my 
experience, only along the coast of southern Florida, and I seriously doubt 
the correctness of the localities, " Illinois" and " New York," as given in 
Mr. Leng's Synopses of Cerambycidce (Entom. Amer., i, p. 32). 

The largest and most striking tree in the " hammock" is the Gumbo 
Limbo tree (Btirsera gummifera}, but no Coleoptera or Lepidoptera were 
found to feed on the leaves. The only Scolytid which burrows in the 
trunk proved to be the common and widely- distributed Xyleborus fuscatus, 
while big holes often seen in the trunk prove that the tree has been inhab 
ited by a gigantic Cerambycid {Stenodontes maxillosui). Under bark of 
decaying trees numerous specimens of the genera Ditoina, Silvanus, 
L&mophlceus, Smicrips, Bactridium, Cossomis, etc., are met with, among 
them several undescribed species, or, more correctly speaking, West In 
dian species, hitherto not known from the United States. 

The fig-trees on Key West are, owing to their stunted, shrub-like growth, 
much less inhabited by insects than they are on Biscayne Bay or the larger 
Keys ; but, under the bark of a species of Ficus (probably pedunculata), 
which I saw only on Key West, I found great numbers of a remarkable 
new Thysanoes. Spalacopsis stolata, Methia pusilla, various Elaphid-

t 

ton, and Leptostylus bore in the smaller branches of Ftcus, but were much 
more common in the Biscayne Bay country. 

The Poison Wood (Rktis metopium} is greatly subject to the attacks of 
Tetrapriocera longicornis, but the tree vigorously defends itself by exud 
ing from the wounded places quantities of a resinous gum which drowns 
the boring beetles. Trees weakened by fire or other causes are usually 
riddled with the holes of the Tetrapriocera which seems to attack the tree 
for feeding purposes only and not for oviposition. At least I never found 
the larva in the Poison Wood, though I discovered it later at Biscayne Bay 
under quite different conditions. An undescribed species of Teretriosoma 
preys upon the Tetrapriocera and may frequently be found by cutting into 
the burrows of the latter. The tree further harbors a peculiar Scolytid (a 
new Pitvophthorus), which constructs very neat galleries under the bark, 
and several other interesting species, e. g:, Scalidia linearis and Dysme- 
rus basalts. 

The Cocoa-plum (Chrysubalanus icaco} is also among the more common 
trees and appears to be the only food-plant of Pseudomus inftatus, a remark 
able new Xyleborus allied to pyri, and a large species of Caryoborus. The 
genera Lembodes and Erodiscus are also not rare on this tree, but do not 
seem to be confined thereto. 

Mr. Schwarz added a short account of the insects annoying and 
molesting man on Key West. There is no want of the various 
in-door pests, such as ants, roaches, fleas and bed-bugs. Out-doors, 
mosquitoes, Chrysops, Tabanus, Ceratopogon are not unusually 
troublesome, while ticks and red-bugs {Leptus irritans) appear 
to be entirely absent. The most interesting species is the jigger 
{Rhynchoprion penetrans), which is quite abundant in the out 
skirts of the city, and which is said to occur also at Lake Worth, 
some 250 miles farther north. 

Mr. Schwarz also exhibited larva and imago of Oligotoma Hub- 
bar di (family Embidce}. The larva is not uncommonly met 
with in southern Florida, occurring singly in the old galleries of 
wood-boring insects. It is quite active, and no spinning habits 
were observed. Only a few images, apparently all males, were 
observed occurring in company with the larvae. The species was 
never seen on the wing.

Seven persons present. President Howard in the chair. 

Mr. Smith reported on the entomological papers read before the 
American Association for the Advancement of Science during the 
recent meeting in New York.* 

Mr. Howard, as an instance of true, although somewhat misdi 
rected, entomological enthusiasm, told the adventures of J. K , 

a member of a New Jersey scientific society, as recently related to 
him by a member of the same society. 

It seems that K , a young man, uneducated and poor, a collector of 

macrolepidoptera, had obtained possession of some work descriptive of 
some of the British Museum collections. He thought of those entomo 
logical treasures all day; he dreamed of them by night until he was fairly 
daft for a sight of them. He gave up his job (he was a day laborer) and 
went, almost penniless, to New York, where, after long striving, he se 
cured a chance to work his passage to Liverpool as cook's assistant on a 
sailing vessel. He arrived at Liverpool without a cent, tramped across to 
London, subsisting almost entirely on charity, and at last arrived before 
the Museum, only to find that the insect collections were closed up for 
some months during repairs or transfers. Completely disheartened, he 
sat down on the curb and cried. Policeman investigates cause of tears, 
crowd gathers, and, among others, fortunately, one of the assistant cura 
tors hears the doleful story, takes pity on the poor man, and enables him 
to get a sight at the collections. This was all he wanted. After feasting 
his eyes he sought work, and finally found his way back to New Jersey, a 
happy and contented man. 

Mr. Howard mentioned the recent rearing by Mr. Scudder of 
an Ichneumonid parasite {Ichneumon instabilis] from an adult 
of the White Mountain Butterfly ( Chionobas semidea), and stated 
that he knew of no recorded instance of the rearing of a Hymen- 
opterous parasite from an adult Lepidopteron. 

Mr. Schwarz exhibited specimens of both sexes of Dysmerus 
basalis from southern Florida. The female is in every respect a 
Lcemophlceus, and even in the male the antennal structure does 
not seem to warrant a generic separation of Lcemophlceus. 

Mr. Ulke exhibited an apparently undescribed Calandrid beetle, 
allied to Phlceophagus, which he had recently found in the District 
of Columbia.

Mr. Ashmead read the following paper: 

A PROPOSED NATURAL ARRANGEMENT OF THE HYMENOPTEROUS 

FAMILIES. 

BY WM. H. ASHMEAD. 

A natural arrangement of the divisions and families of the Hymenoptera, 
according to my views, differs so materially from that proposed by Mr. 
E. T. Cresson in his recent excellent work, " Synopsis of the Families and 
Genera of the N. A. Hymenoptera," that this early opportunity is taken to 
draw attention to them while that work is fresh before the entomological 
world. 

The division of the order into two sections Hymen, ditrocha and Hymen, 
monotrocha is, I think, a natural one; but the arrangement of the fami 
lies by Mr. Cresson is, in some respects, very unnatural, and fails to show 
their relationship. 

The section monotrocha I consider to contain the highest types of the 
order, and hold with Dr. A. S. Packard that, among the family Apidce, 
are found the most highly specialized forms. 

Beginning therefore with this family, I think a very natural sequence of 
the families can be shown leading into the Hymenoptera ditrocha as fol 
lows :

It will be seen that the anomalous family, PelccinidiE, is assigned a po 
sition between the Pompilida and the Sp/iecidce. 

Mr. Cresson placed it temporarily near Ichn-umonidoc, but it cannot be 
long there, the trochanters being one-jointed, a fact to which Mr. Cresson 
calls special attention It seems to me to be allied to the long-bodied 
Sphecids, AmmophilcE, and a position is assigned the family near them. 

Prof. Packard has, somewhere, called attention to the fact that the male 
Pclecinus resembles the genus Trypoxylon in the family Crabronidae. That 
this anomalous family belongs somewhere in this section, I think cannot 
be questioned. 

The families Mulillidce and Chrystdidcz lead naturally into the Hymen,

which reason that family is placed at the head of that section 

For the section Hymen, ditrocha the divisions first proposed by St. Far- 
geau are preferred to those made use of by Mr. Cresson, for they enable 
the presentation of a much more natural sequence of the families than 
could otherwise be given. 

They are as follows :

Ovipositor consisting of a single horny piece issuing from the tip of the 

abdomen, CANALIFERA. 

Ovipositor spiral or semi-spiral, retractile when at rest, . . SPIRIFERA. 

Ovipositor of two horny, saw-like pieces, SERRIFERA. 

Ovipositor partly lodged at rest in an external sheath from beneath some 

distance from apex of abdomen, ...... TEREBELLIFERA.

It will be seen that the Mymarince have been removed from the family 
Proctotriipidce ; the ovipositor does not issue from the apex of the abdo 
men, and they have other characters that exclude them from that group. 
The English hymenopterist, A. H. Haliday, many years ago, recognized 
this fact and placed them among the Chalcididce ; but his views, apparently, 
were not accepted, for all late systematists let them remain undisturbed 
among the Proctotrupidce. From a study of several of the genera I feel con 
vinced Mr. Haliday was nearly right in placing them with the Chalcididae. 

Among them are the smallest? and most degraded hymenopters known, 
and, while allied in habits to the Chalcididae, in structure they offer char 
acters that seem to me to entitle them to family rank. 

In venation and the fore wings of some of them there is a remarkable 
resemblance to certain forms among the Trichogrammince, the lowest group 
of the Chalcididce, and I have therefore assigned them a position after 
that group. 

The following table maybe used to separate these three families : 

Hind wings linear, . 2 

Hind wings not linear; 

ovipositor issuing from the extreme tip of abdomen, PROCTOTRUPID^E. 

ovipositor issuing from the middle of venter, . . . CHALCIDIDAE. 

2. Ovipositor issuing subapically, ....... MYMARID^E, m. 

With the Mymarince removed the Proctotruptdce form a natural group 
closely connected with the parasitic Cynipidce through the Diapriince and 
Eucoilince. 



OF WASHINGTON. 99 

The Cynipidce through the Ibaliince and Oryssidce connect with the 
Tenthredinidcen, and a natural sequence of the other families follows, as is 
shown in the arrangement of the families above given. 

The Braconidce seem to me to be more closely allied to certain saw-flies, 
and in consequence are placed above the Ickneumonidce. 

Both of these families need revision, and no effort is made to arrange 
the subfamilies. 

The Ichneumom'dce connect naturally then through the Trigonalidce and 
Stephanidce with the Evaniidce, and the latter lead naturally into the 
Chalcididce through the genus Hyptia and the Eucharid genus Lophyro- 
cera Cameron, a species of which I have taken in Florida and named in 
MS. jL. JJoridana. 

The sequence of the subfamilies in the Chalcididce as arranged above 
seems to be a very natural one, so gradually do they merge the one into the 
other. 

The Eucharince, Perilampince and Eurytomince are very closely allied, 
and the last through Aximince. form a very close connection with the Chal- 
cidiiice, Torymince and the following groups. 

I am by no means satisfied that Axima is entitled to subfamily rank ; it 
seems to me to belong to the Eurytomid group. 

The Blastophagce, or fig insects, Francis Walker placed in the Procto- 
trupidce ; according to Sir Sidney Saunders, they form a section in the 
Cynipidce while Prof. ] O. Westwood says they belong to the Chalcididce. 
At present engaged in preparing a monograph of the N. A. Cynipidae, 
I was very desirous of satisfying myself on this point, and fortunately have 
been able to do so. from a study of possibly an undescribed species, now in 
the U. S. Department of Agriculture, recently collected by Mr. E. A. 
Schwarz, on Ficus aurea in South Florida. 

The species studied evidently belongs to Saunders' genus Kradibia, 
which Dr. Mayr, in his " Feigen-insecten," says is identical with Blasto- 
phaga Grav. ; at any rate it is no Cynips, and I agree with Prof Westwood 
in considering the Blastophagce as a group in the Chalcididce. 

They seem most closely allied to the Spalangince and a position is as 
signed them next to that subfamily. 

In conclusion, I beg to say that the views herein set forth are based upon 
a tolerably close study of most of the families mentioned, all being known 
to me in nature but two Mellinidce and Ampulicidce. 

In discussing this paper Mr. Howard stated that it appeared to 
him that Mr. Ashmead's arrangement was, in the main, a one- 
character classification, and that no natural classification should 
be attempted without a thorough review of many characters. 
The ovipositor is an important organ, and its variations should 
have much weight, but an arrangement of the families according 
to such variations will clear up but a single factor in the problem.

Mr. Howard also took strong exception to the placing of the sub 
family Mymarince among the Chalcidida , calling attention to the 
pronotal characters as having great weight in retaining it with the 
ProctotrupidcE. The resemblance of the venational characters to 
those of the Trickogrammince he considered of little value, and 
cited the resemblance in the venation with certain Scelionincc to 
that of many Chalcididce as much more striking. He also stated 
that while, under the microscope, the ovipositor with the Myma- 
rinse apparently arises near the base of the abdomen, this appear 
ance may be due to the great transparency of the abdomen with 
this group, and that on careful study it may possibly be found to 
issue from the tip, as with other Proctotrupidce.

NOTE ON A NEW PARASITE OF CAMPONOTUS PENNSYLVANICUS. 

By W. H. Fox, M. D. 

During the past summer it was my good fortune to meet with the larval 
form of an interesting and peculiar parasite of the common black ant 
( Camponotus pennsylvanicui). 

About the middle of July, while sitting on the front steps of a house in 
Ilollis, New Hampshire, I noticed several decapitated bodies of the black 
ant which still retained the power of motion. Being curious to know what 
had become of the heads, I instituted a search, and was rewarded by find 
ing several of them. To my surprise, the heads also seemed to have the 
power of motion; but this was easily explained on a little closer scrutiny. 
Each head was found to be inhabited by a white grub, which completely 
filled the cranial cavity. The articulation of the mouth parts had been 
destroyed, and the appendages had fallen off, leaving an opening through 
which the larva could protrude its anterior extremity. So completely had 
the contents of the head been destroyed that, upon the removal of the larva, 
the eyes of the ant were seen to be transparent, and the articulations of the 
antennse'showed as two light spots. The mode of motion of the larva was 
simple but interesting. The head of the ant was kept on its flat, or poste 
rior, surface, and the larva took a firm hold on the wood of the steps, close 
to the mouth opening; then, by elongating itself, it pushed its domicile in 
the opposite direction as far as possible; then, loosening its hold, con 
tracted, and began again. The rate of travel was very slow, for I have left 
one for over half an hour and found it again, on my return, within a couple 
of feet of the spot where it was left. As to the mature form of this insect 
I know nothing, not even the order to which it belongs. A few of the larvae 
are presented for examination, and several have been kept in some earth, 
in the hope that I can get the imago from them next summer. I would 
say that I have also found this parasite in the head before the latter had

become detached from the body of the ant, showing that the egg had been 
deposited in the living host. Hoping to be able to clear this subject up 
more fully at some future time, I must leave it as it stands for the present.* 

Mr. Lugger read the following paper : 

A NEW METHOD OF PRESERVING TRANSPARENT AOJJATIC INSECTS 
FOR THE MICROSCOPE. 
BY O. LUGGEK. 

The study of transparent aquatic larvae of the various orders of insects is 
both amusing and instructive. For the former purpose a common life-cell 
is all that is required, and many a pleasant hour can be spent with the 
microscope in contemplating the beauties of these delicate objects. The 
whole of the internal anatomy and the workings of the various organs can 
be studied with ease. But for the more serious work the life-cell alone is 
not sufficient. The object to be studied will soon die under these unnatu 
ral conditions for lack of air, and it is often difficult, if not impossible, to 
substitute a second specimen for the dead and now opaque object. Even 
if careful drawings have been prepared of the still transparent larva, it is 
all-important to preserve the object in such a manner that it can always 
be consulted at any future time. 

Various, more or less successful, methods have been invented, but all 
have proven futile after a short time; the preserved specimens either 
shrink out of all proportions or they become opaque and useless. 

Some time ago I received by exchange a slide prepared by Mr. Dunker, 
of Berlin. He succeeded in inventing a method of preparing the lower 
animals and plants found in standing water in a perfectly natural condi 
tion. Infusoria, small Algse, Rhizopods, Flagellates, Ciliates, Chloro- 
phyllacese, Desmids, Diatoms, Daphnia, and Cyclops species were thus 
prepared by him and sold in large numbers. However, Mr. Dunker has 
shown very little liberality in this matter, and keeps his method a secret. 
When I received the slide I concluded to sacrifice it, hoping to be able to 
discover his method. I broke the cover-glass, and immediately I per 
ceived the odor of something familiar, and related to the cheap alcohol 
made of wood. The substance is Rectified Wood-vinegar (Acetum pyro- 
lignosum rectificatum). Many experiments during the last three months 
convinced me that this is the preserving material long desired. Of course, 
I do not know whether Mr. Dunker uses the same simple material or a com 
pound in which it occurs. 

A neat and very useful cell for mounting aquatic specimens was shown 



* Mr Howard, in a paper read before the Biological Society of Washing 
ton, October 22, 1887, stated that this parasitic larva probably belongs to 
the Dipterous family Conopidce, the larvae of one or more species of which 
have been found in Europe to be parasitic in the abdomen of Bombus, 
Osmia, Odynerus, and Pompilus.

me some time ago by Dr. Thos. Taylor, of the Department of Agriculture. 
This cell is very easily made, and can be built up very quickly to any de 
sired height The substance used for this purpose is common beeswax. 
To make the cell harder, and to raise the melting-point, a slight amount 
of powdered resin is added. Both materials are heated together in a small 
porcelain dish, so as to thoroughly combine them into a homogeneous 
mass. If required for use, the dish is simply heated, and the cell is made 
in the usual way upon a turn-table. Since both turn-table and slide are 
colder than the wax, the cell becomes visible at once, and, by repeated ap 
plications with the brush, it can be made of any required depth. If too 
high, or if too sloping towards the centre, the wax can be readily re 
moved upon the turn-table by the application of a knife; a groove for the 
reception of the cover-glass is also very readily made. The cell is now 
ready for most purposes, and is an excellent one for mounting with 
glycerine jelly and Canada balsam. If another material oil, for instance 
is to be used which would dissolve the wax, the inside of the cell should 
first be coated with any of the usual varnishes, such as Brunswick black. 
The same varnish should also be used from the outside to seal the com 
pleted and filled cell. I have found such cells of great utility in enclosing 
aquatic larva?. To do so satisfactorily, I make with a knife a shallow cut 
across the cell and fill the latter with water in which the larva to be pre 
served has been placed. By gently pressing down with a cover-glass I can 
secure the still living specimen in any desired position. Now I remove 
with a piece of blotting-paper a very small quantity of the water through 
one of the cuts previously made and allow at the other cut the Pyroligne- 
ous Acid to enter. As soon as this acid has reached the larva this dies at 
once in the position occupied at the time. The cell is now sealed in the 
usual way; but previous to doing so the sides of the two cuts are pressed 
together. 

Specimens thus treated remain unchanged for a long time ; for how long 
I do not know as yet, but possibly for an indefinite time, if not exposed to 
the sunlight. 

With this method of preserving transparent aquatic larvae can be com 
bined the staining of them at the same time. For this purpose Aniline- 
blue or Fuchsine should be used, which are soluble in water. One part 
of the color, dissolved in 200 parts distilled water, is mixed with 800 parts 
of the rectified pyroligneous acid. The modus operandi is the same. In 
the course of several hours the object has become uniformly stained, and 
can be sealed after the addition of another drop of the acid. If stained 
too dark, a current of the diluted acid will soon remedy this fault. 

Mr. Lugger also showed some very peculiar Dipterous larvae, 
received by him from the vicinity of Wood's Holl, Mass. They 
were found in tide pools, fastened to some of the long-leaved 
species of Ulva. The larvae belong to a species of Ephydra.

Mr. Smith said that, on the occasion of a recent visit to Phila 
delphia, he had an opportunity of looking over carefullv the 
Sphingidas of the collection of the Am. Ent. Soc. Many of these 
are determined by Mr. Grote, and the types of his papers on Cuban 
Sphingidae are there. In the genus Diludia* Mr. Grote has three 
species, jasminearum, brontes and leucophceata. The species 
are not at all congeneric. Brontes is the type of the genus and 
has a large, prominent head, armed fore tarsi and produced thorax. 
He pointed out the difference between the species referred to here, 
and claims that neither brontes nor leucophceata are properly 
members of our fauna, but must be dropped from our lists, ycts- 
Diinearum is entirely different generically from the others.* 

Mr. Howard spoke at some length of a recent trip to Cambridge, 
Ithaca, and Philadelphia. He praised the extensive biological 
collection of insects in the Agassiz Museum, and exhibited a case 
of a Caddis Worm {Aspatherium picicorne] , given him by Dr. 
Hagen, and which had been infested by an Ichneumonid, Agrio- 
typus armatus. The same parasite is known to infest Spathi- 
dopteryx ( Phryganeidce] . He mentioned the fact that the col 
lection of Braconidce, presented by Dr. Foerster to the Peabodv 
Academy, is now in the Agassiz Museum, and prior to its removal 
it had become badly damaged, and that now less than half of the 
species are in condition for comparison. He then described the 
systematic collection which Prof. Comstock has brought together 
at the Cornell University, Ithaca, N. Y. This is already a most 
excellent reference collection. The Lepidoptera have been deter 
mined by Grote, Morrison, and Mrs. Fernald ; the Hemiptera by 
Uhler ; the Diptera by Williston ; the Orthoptera by Scudder and 
Pierce, and the Hymenoptera by Cresson. He also described 
several ingenious contrivances invented by Prof. Comstock, and 
in use in his laboratory. Among them the block-system for the 
arrangement of a permanent collection, his darkened glass tubes 
for the observation of pith-inhabiting Hymenoptera, his automatic 
apparatus for the inflation of several larvae at once, his cabinet 
with insulated drawers for colonies of ants, and his cartridge belt 
for collecting purposes. He did not dwell upon the collection of

ance of the Lepidoptera over other orders, and stated that this

ON THE INSECTS FOUND ON UNIOLA PANICULATA IN SOUTHEASTERN 

FLORIDA. 

BY E A. SCHWAKZ. 

Uniola paniculata is an ornamental grass commonly known as " Sea- 
oats," and very abundant at the ocean beach in Florida, where the plant 
reaches a height of from five to seven feet. Toward the beginning of June 
of this year I had the good fortune to visit several times the beach opposite 
Lake Worth, in southeastern Florida and my attention was then attracted 
by several insect depredators on this Uniola disfiguring and thinning out 



OF WASHINGTON. 105 

the beautiful ears of the grass so that I had difficulty in finding perfect 
specimens of the plant. This fact induced me to look a little more care 
fully into the insects living on Uniola with the following result : 

A species of Oxacis is extremely abundant on the ears of the plant and 
most injurious thereto. Many ears are entirely denuded by the hundreds 
of specimens found upon a single large plant. They are very active and 
wary, and many specimens fly off on the approach of a person. At this 
season I failed to find the larva in the old roots of the plant, but the same, 
or an allied, species has been bred before by Mr. Hubbard from larvae liv 
ing in decaying wood buried in the sand along the beach. The particular 
species to which this Oxacis belongs cannot yet be ascertained, owing to 
the confusion into which this genus has fallen by the accumulation of more 
abundant material, which shows' an extraordinary degree of variability in 
coloration and sculpture. 

This Oxacis is vigorously assisted in its destructive work by numerous 
specimens of Hymenorus densus, the earlier stages of which still remain 
unknown to me. It is true that a large number of larva? are met with 
among the old roots of Uniola as well as other plants growing on the bank 
of the beach, but if the larvae of Hymenorus were among them I have been 
unable to distinguish, them from what I took to be the larva? of Bla^stt'nus 
or Phaleria. At any rate, the larvae of Hymenorus and Oxacis live in de- 
caving vegetable matter, and are not injurious to the living plant. 

A third species not infrequently seen on the ears is Mordellistena splen- 
dens. It was observed by me to feed upon the pollen, and of its natural 
history I shall speak further on. 

A fourth abundantly-occurring species is Collops nigriceps, which is seen 
actively running up and down the plant. I could not find out whether it 
feeds on the pollen or on the larva of the insect presently to be mentioned, 
viz : 

The common Chinch Bug (Blissus leucopterus), which occurs in large 
number on the upper parts of the Uniola, and which, in this southern lati 
tude, develops some peculiar traits. In regard to geographical distribu 
tion, it may be of interest to state that the Chinch Bug extends along the 
Atlantic coast as far south as Cape Florida, being absent on the shores of 
Biscayne Bay and on the chain of the Keys, but reappearing on the coast 
of Cuba, and probably also on other islands of the West Indies. The same 
distribution is participated in by Uniola panictilata and many other insects 
and plants. The Chinch Bug further occurs in this southern latitude only 
in the brachypterous form, as I never, among thousands of specimens, saw 
a single macropterous specimen, and it appears that the warm climate of 
semi-tropical Florida, which ought to be rather favorable to the develop 
ment of the macropterous form, is more than counterbalanced by the tough 
and coarse nature of the food-plant. Uniola paniculata appears to be the 
only food-plant of the Chinch Bug at Lake Worth and Cape P"lorida, as I 
found onlv a few scattered imagos on the few other grasses growing on the 
bank of the beach, and on these the bugs may have been blown down 



106 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

from the Uniola. Contrary to the habits shown by this insect in our more 
northern cultivated fields, the Chinch Bug is to be found on Uniola only 
on the upper portion of the plant, the images and larger specimens among 
the ears, the younger between the upper blades. The reason for this habit 
is, in my opinion, easily 'explained by the very woody and tough nature 
of the lower part of this storm-beaten plant, and further by the fact that 
the constantly drifting sand would make life rather uncomfortable for the 
Chinch Bug close to the ground. Finally, I would state that in all my 
travels in central and southern Florida I do not remember having found 
the Chinch Bug in considerable number in the interior of the country; in 
fact, I never found a single specimen in the valley of the St. John's River. 

A very small species of Phlceothrips occurred at the base of the younger 
blades, but is hardly numerous enough to affect the plant in any way. 

Of special interest to me among the insects just enumerated was Mor- 
dellistena splendens, which I had never found before, and its constant oc 
currence on Uuiola suggested to me the probability of finding its earlier 
stages within the stem of the plant. Upon cutting open the dead and 
dying plants I was soon rewarded with finding the insect in the larva, 
pupa, and imago states. Most of the specimens were images ready to 
issue from the stems, many were still in the pupa stage, while the larva; 
were already tolerably scarce. From the numerous specimens thus found 
by me the natural history of Mordellistena splendent may be summed up 
as follows : The female beetle inserts a single egg in the stem just beneath 
the ear, and the young larva commences to hollow out the interior of the 
stem (or rather to widen the naturally hollow inside), making its way 
downward. The duration of the larval state is unknown to me, but when 
full-grown the larva has hollowed out a distance of from one and a half to 
two feet. The stem of the plant increases in width downwards, and the 
larva, when it has arrived at the lower end of its burrow, is thus enabled 
to turn around. It then reascends within the stem until it has reached the 
place where the diameter of the hollowed interior is just large enough to 
prevent the larva or pupa from sliding downwards. Here it changes to 
pupa, but before doing so it gnaws a round hole in the side wall until only 
the thin outer skin is left. The change to pupa then takes place, and the 
perfect insect, after casting the pupa skin, finds itself with its head just 
opposite the nearly completed opening. It breaks, or rather eats its way 
through the outer skin and escapes. I cannot tell whether there are two 
or more annual generations in this species, but it appears that the plant 
is killed by the working of the larva. Of parasites, I failed to discover 
any; but in some of the plants, evidently hollowed out by the Mordellis 
tena larva, I found a solitary ant which has kindly been determined by Mr. 
Pergande as Colobopsis impressa. Wherever the stem was inhabited by the 
ant I failed to find any trace of the Mordellistena larva; nor was there the 
usual exit hole which would prove that the larva had passed through its 
transformation and that the ant had entered the stem through the exit 
hole of the beetle. I presume, therefore, that the ant enters the stem 
from the root and eats the larva. 



OF WASHINGTON. 107 

To complete this short review of the insects found on Uniola, it still re 
mains to be mentioned that the stems deserted by the Mordellistena fre 
quently become the abode of numerous specimens of a Ptinid beetle of the 
genus HemiptycJtus, the larvae of which feed upon the ddbris left by the 
Mordellistena larva. 

Mr. Schwarz made a communication regarding the correlation 
in the increase of the number of mosquitoes on the one side and 
certain species of dragon-flies on the other side, as observed by 
him in the months of May and June, at Biscayne Bay, in south 
eastern Florida. 

The following is an abstract from his remarks : 

Mosquitoes abound in that section of the country at all seasons, but when 
ever the regular trade wind ceases to blow they enormously increase in 
numbers and become a most serious pest, which greatly interferes with all 
out-door occupations, especially in the hammock lands. During such mos 
quito spells there is an equally sudden and great increase in numbers of 
certain dragon-flies, and this is the more interesting because there is a great 
scarcity of fresh water in the country south of Miami River. It may be 
presumed, however, that most of the dragon-flies come from the Ever 
glades to the shore of Biscayne Bay, a distance of about 7 or 8 miles. 
Three species of dragon flies, Celithemis eporina, Libellula auripennis, 
and Anax ingens, were thus incredibly abundant at times, while two or three 
others did not participate in this increase. 

Mr. Schwarz also mentioned a peculiar habit in Danais bere- 
nice observed by him at Biscayne Bay, Fla. Whenever the cut 
weeds and shrubbery were burned on the cleared patches, these 
butterflies congregated in great numbers on the heated rocks close 
to the line of the fire. 

Mr. Smith exhibited a specimen of Cicindela Belfragei, which 
shows a curious abnormity in the shape of an acute tubercle on 
the left side of the prothorax. 

Mr. Smith also called attention to some modifications of tarsal 
structure among the Arctiidce. He finds that some genera, as 
Leucarctia and Ecpantheria, have the claws cleft to the base- 
others, like Phragmatobia and Pyrrharctia, have them dentate 
at the tip, while in Spilosoma and Antarctia there is a distinct 
long tooth at the middle of the claw. The claws are not always 
alike on all feet. Sometimes the claws of fore tarsi only are 
toothed, and sometimes all are so in any case the anterior claws 
are the ones modified. What value this character should have is

ON THE MORPHOLOGY OF SCORPIONID^E. 

BY DK. GEORGE MAKX. 

In studying the morphology of the Scorpions, as far as the limited num 
ber of species at my disposal allows me, I have noted a few points which 
seemed to me to be of general interest. 

Allow me first to draw your attention to a peculiar and remarkable con 
dition in the organization of the Scorpion, viz., that of an intense concen 
tration and aggregation in the anterior region of the body, in opposition 
to an exaggerated extension or elongation in the posterior part. 

We know that the Arachnids are acephal, that early in their embryonic 
evolution the development of the head was interrupted, that it was, so to 
speak, swallowed up by the more intensified development of the thorax; 
in contradistinction to the formation of the cephalothorax of the crusta 
ceans, where the head, in the course of its development, became simply 
blended or coalesced with the chest : the absence of the two principal attri 
butes of the head, the antennae and the true eyes, in the Arachnids, is suf 
ficient proof of this. But, in addition to this, we find in the anterior part 
a state of aggregation, which seems so much the stranger if we compare 
it with the extravagant and lavish state of extension in the posterior. We 
need only to examine the sternal side of the cephalothorax to notice at 
once the crowded condition of the joints of insertion of the appendages. 
We see that some parts, which are in allied orders, well developed and oc-

cupy their natural position, are here pushed into other places, or overlap, 
or are abbreviated, atrophied, or altered to such a degree that their true 
character can only, with difficulty, be rightly determined. And, if we now 
examine the posterior region, it contains internally no organ which could 
not be, and is not in the closely allied forms, abbreviated to half its length ; 
it bears externally no other important part, except the sole defensor, the 
poisonous sting, and probably the body was so elongated that this weapon 
might be able to protect the animal from an attack upon any part of its 
body. 

The whole body of the Scorpion is covered by a tough, coriaceous mem 
brane, which is prone to develop into plate-like structures, sclerites, of a 
hard chitinous consistence. These sclerites cover the dorsal and ventral 
parts of the body and the appendages and only the pleural sides of the 
cephalothorax and the abdomen, and the articulations of the latter are free 
and enveloped by the athrodial membrane. These sclerites form the ex 
ternal skeleton of the Scorpion. 

Viewing the body from a general morphological standpoint, we find it 
naturally divided into three distinct regions : the cephalothorax or pro- 
soma, the abdomen or mesosoma, and the tail o-- metasoma. Each of 
these regions consisted originally of six segments, but the condition of 
concentration in the prosoma has obliterated these articulations, and they 
are only indicated by the six pairs of appendages which it bears. The 
meso- and metasoma consist of apparently thirteen segments, but the 
terminal joint of the tail, the vesica, with the long and sharp sting, can 
not be counted with the abdominal segments on account of its post-anal 
position; it is an abdominal appendage. 

The cephalothorax is covered dorsally by a solitary chitinous plate, the 
Carapace, into which the organs of vision are inserted. They consist 
of three groups of simple eyes, corresponding with the ocelli of the 
insects. A large pair is situated in the median line of the carapax, either 
at, or before, or behind the centre of the longitudinal axis; on each side, 
at the latero-anterior-angle of the carapace is a group of two or three ocelli, 
with sometimes one or two accessory ones, like those of Thelyphomis which 
I mentioned on a former occasion. I have here to withdraw a statement 
made at a previous meeting, that these accessory eyes are not provided 
with a separate branch of the optic nerve, and are, consequently, mere 
granular integumentary formations an opinion which other naturalists 
also entertain but in Androctonuz, which generally possesses two acces 
sory ocelli, I have found a distinct branch to both. This fact, however, 
has been long known, and in 1843 Newport, of England, described, in his 
excellent paper, the lateral ocular branches of the optic nerve. 

The six pairs of appendages of the prosoma are : the mandibles, the 
maxilhe, and the four pairs of legs. The mandibles are three-jointed, 
and the two joints form a chela or forceps. Let me here mention that a 
very important point in the present classification is based on the tooth 
armature of both of the mandibular fingers; indeed, the existence of sub-

families depends upon the presence of one or two minute teeth on the 
inferior margin of the immovable finger. 

The maxillae are situated below 
the mandibles, in close proximity. 
They are broad and square and of 
a hard chitinous consistence; they 
are upholstered on their inner sur 
face with a fleshy and softly-pubes 
cent cushion, which rubs against 
the one on the other side, thus pro 
ducing a vacuum which assists in 
sucking the prey ; a sharp and pow 
erful process at the anterior end of 
the maxillae helps the other trophi 
to tear asunder the body of the vic 
tim. The maxilla? bear the large, 
five-jointed, maxillary palpus, orig 
inally an ambulatory organ, in 
which the three tarsal joints are 
developed into a powerful prehen 
sile organ of large dimensions. The 
hand, the former first metatarsal 
joint, with the immovable finger (2d metatarsal segment) and the movable 
finger (the former tarsus), forms thus a part constructed like the mandibles. 
It may be of some interest to you that the chela of the Arachnids differs 
from that part in the Crustaceans in that here the outer finger is movable 
while in the latter class it is the inner finger that moves. 

In the posterior area of the narrow free space between the maxillae, we 
notice a fleshy and softly pubescent piece, the ligula, which serves here as 
a palate ; at its base is the minute resophageal opening. 

Below the maxillae, and forming the floor of the oral cavity, is situated 

the labium, a thin and flat plate-like 
organ, divided in the centre longitu 
dinally, thus forming two lobes. The 
structural character of this part has 
been hitherto strangely misunder 
stood on account of its external ap 
pearance from the underside ; for here 
it appears to be four-lobed, as the long 
and narrow, two-lobed prosternum is, 
in consequence of the condition of

inside of the mouth, we may easily see the true structure (Fig. 3, e, the 
labium). 

In no other order of Arachnids is the fact 
so nicely, so distinctly demonstrated, ad 
oculos, that the first pair of legs will soon 
(in a higher class) develop into labial palpi, 
as in the Scorpions ; for here we see clearly 
the insertion of these appendages into the 
sides of the labium (Figs. , and a). 

That the part which occupies the median the mouth; I, coxae of the first 

r*.u i u- 4-u pair of legs, 

area of the labium is the prosternum, is proven 

by the insertion of the second coxae, that is, the coxae of the first true 
legs, which insertion is clearly illustrated in some genera of the family 
Pandinoidce. in which the labial border surrounds the basal part of the 
coxae (Fig. 2, sternal side of Hormurus Unde riv oodii n. sp.) The meso- 
sternum is not always visible, at least not at the external surface; and 
where it is distinctly present it has been hitherto overlooked by observ 
ers. In the family Androctonoidce we distinctly see in many genera a 
small tubercular process right at the anterior border of the " sternum " 
the metasternum (Fig. i, b}. In the family Pandinoidce, where the 
metasternum is less reduced in size than in the former, the mesosternum 
is blended with the metasternum, and is indicated visibly in many gen 
era by a distinct line and a difference in the angular position of these two 
areas (Fig. 2, , mesosternum). 

The metasternum is the great criterion for the families into which the 
order of the Scorpions is divided. Is it long and very narrow, or sub-tri 
angular, the animal belongs to the family Androctonoidce ; if it is pentag 
onal, the family Pandinoidce is indicated; while those scorpions without a 
metasternum, or in which it is only represented by two transverse linear 
structures, are included in the third family, Bothriuroidce. 

The second general region of the body, the mesosoma or abdomen, with 
its seven segments at the dorsal surface (some naturalists consider the last 
segment as belonging to the tail), has ventrally apparently only five scler- 
ites. But we notice in the narrow space between the last pair of coxae and 
immediately behind the metasternum two peculiar structures, the anterior 
of which represents the genital operculum (Fig. i, /), and below which 
lies the sexual apparatus. As tbis operculum is of the same form in both 
sexes, the scorpion cannot be sexually differentiated by this organ. Be 
hind the operculum, which is generally of an oval, plate-like form, are sit 
uated those peculiar organs which are original to the Scorpion, the combs 
(Fig. i , /). Of the functions of these organs we know absolutely nothing. 

By the concentration of the cephalothorax the space for the two an 
terior ventral sclerites becomes so scarce and narrow that only the genital 
tubercle of the first ventral segment and the jugum with the combs of the 
second segment are retained, while the rest of the space is occupied by the 

third and fourth coxae.

Each of the following ventral sclerites. with the exception of the last, 
bears a pair of stigmatic openings which lead to the lung-books, and which 
are considered the invaginated external respiratory organs of an inferior 
class of Arthropods. I will state here my opinion in regard to the lung- 
books and the combs, without going into detail or endeavoring to prove it : 
The respiratory organs, which are now concealed in the abdomen, were 
in a prototype originally outside of the body, and much larger in size and 
in jive pairs ; that the first pair, by being situated nearer the genital appa 
ratus, became gradually stimulated, and, consequently, hypertrophied, with 
an increased blood and nerve supply, until they became so large that they 
were retained either as a necessary or important accessory to copulation, 
or a pleasant excitor in the voluptuous play of love-making. 

The last great region, the metasoma or tail, is by rights not a tail but a 
part of the abdomen, that is, it contains internally the proctodaeum or 
colon, the large caudal artery and the spinal cord with its four caudal gan 
gliaorgans which are not found in a tail sensu proprio It is only its 
form that distinguishes this region from the mesosoma. This part is al 
ways much longer and more slender in the male than in the female. 

The legs of the Arachnids are generally composed of seven principal 
joints, as follows : coxa, trochanter, femur, patella, tibia, metatarsus, and 
tarsus. We see that here a knee-joint, patella, is inserted between the fe 
mur and the tibia. This knee-joint distinguishes the leg of the Arachnids 
from that of the insects, in which the tibia immediately follows the femur. 
In the Scorpion we find that the joint which follows the femur cannot be 
a knee-joint on account of its form, size, and articulation, but that it cor 
responds exactly with the tibia of the insect leg. In other words, in the 
structure of the leg of the scorpion we find a proof of the closer relation 
ship of that highly organized Arachnid with the next higher developed 
class of insects. 

Mr. Schwarz exhibited the following species and made remarks 
upon them : 

i. The species of insects referred to by Mr. J. B. Smith in his article, 
" Ants' nests and their inhabitants" (Amer. Natur., 1886, p. 686), viz., 
Tapinoma sessile (family Formicidce}, an unnamed Heteropterous larva, an 
undescribed Anthicus (family Anthicidce], and the two species of Temnop- 
sophus (family Malachiidce). All these species occur under the same con 
ditions on low plants in the prairie regions of southern Florida and, 
although belonging to three different orders, exhibit a remarkable resem 
blance in general appearance. This holds especially true of the three first- 
named specie's. As another curious example of accidental resemblance, 
Mr. Schwarz exhibited specimens of Olibrus princeps (family Phalacr idee], 
Exochomus marginipennis (family Coccinellidce), and Argopistes scyrtoides 
(family Chrysomelidai), which occur promiscuously on shrubbery in the 
semitropical portion of Florida.

2. Specimens of Pityophthorus mnutissimu9*.nA its galleries, under bark 
of red oak branches, found at Washington the past month. The primary 
galleries closely resemble those of P. querciperda, exhibited at a former 
meeting (see p. 56), /'. e., they consist of a very short longitudinal gallery 
which is crossed at its upper end by an extremely long transverse gallery. 
It seems that the larvae do not make any galleries of their own. 

3. Specimens of Otidocephahis Poeyi. This species, hitherto known 
only from Cuba, occurs also on Key West. The Floridian specimens are 
much smaller and darker colored than the Cuban specimens, but are spe 
cifically not distinct. Gyllonhal, in his description, briefly mentions a re 
markable character in this species, viz., the presence of a large fovea on 
the upper side of the beak; but Suffrian, in his list of the Rhynchophora 
of Cuba, entirely misinterprets this description and considers the fovea 
as an abnormity. The fact is that this spoon-shaped fovea is a secondary 
male character not recurring in any other described species of the genus. 

4. Specimens of a new Bonvouloiria recently found at Biscayne Bay, 
Fla , the genus being hitherto known only from California and Texas. 
Larvae, pupae, and imagos were found amongst a blackish mould grow 
ing under the bark of freshly-burned stumps. The species, when fully 
matured, has the thorax and one spot on each elytron covered with a snow- 
white, mould-like efflorescence. When just hatched the beetle is without 
this efflorescence and remains so for about two days. Then the efflores 
cence on the thorax rather suddenly makes its appearance and shortly after 
wards the elytral spots. 

5. Specimens of the Scolytids Phlxotribus liminaris and Hylesinus 
opaculus. Dr. Harris, in his description of the former species (Ins. Inj. 
to Veg., 3d ed., p. 84), states that it occurs also under elm bark. Mr. 
Schwarz said that in his experience Phlceotribus liminaris does not occur 
under elm bark, but that Hylesinus, opaculus is rather common under such 
conditions. Both species resemble each other closely, so that, without ex 
amination of the structural character in the antennae, they can hardly be 
distinguished, and it appears probable, therefore, that Dr. Harris had con 
founded the two species. 

Mr. Smith read the following paper : 

SOME OBSERVATIONS ON MUSEUM PESTS. 

BY JOHN B. SMITH. 

One of the primary duties of a person in charge of a large collection of 
insects is keeping out Museum pests as the various species that feed on 
the dried insects are generically termed. In a large collection, like that 
of the National Museum, no inconsiderable time is required for that pur 
pose, as it takes at least two weeks to go through all of the boxes carefully. 

It has been the fashion to recommend as a certain preventative tight 
boxes, and quarantining all specimens before putting into the collection, 
and undoubtedly this is an excellent precaution, saving much future labor. 



114 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

It is however by no means the certain remedy which it has been claimed 
to be. The boxes and cabinets in use in the Museum are as perfect, so far 
as safety is concerned, as it is possible to get them at present, yet withal 
constant care is required. Psocidice will find their way into the tightest 
boxes, and though they do little damage ordinarily, yet in a collection of 
Tineidce, or minute Diptera, they can do quite considerable damage. For 
these pests I have found naphthaline a perfect remedy. A single case of 
the size made by Mr. Akhurst is a perfect protection, and lasts about three 
months ordinarily. 

Tineid larvae are rather rarely found in the collections as the larger 
moths and are not always easily discovered, since they make no dust as 
do the Antkrent. On one occasion, I found that one pair of wings of a 
C. regalis suddenly collapsed without apparent cause. Close examination 
showed a Tineid larva that had been feeding on the dense long vestiture, 
making galleries in all directions, in such a way, that when I took hold of 
one end of the gallery the vestiture of the underside came off in large 
sheets, leaving the wings almost clean, the veins broken here and there, 
which produced the collapse. They rarely burrow into the specimen 
never in my experience. Ptinidce are sometimes found, but are exceed 
ingly rare in our collection. One box, lined with corn pith, was riddled 
with them, and a very few specimens were attacked. 

But by all odds the most dangerous enemies are the larva? of the Der- 
mestidce, which are pests, pure and simple. The principal enemy in our 
collection is Antkrenus varius, though Trogoderma is not uncommon. 
My experience with these is, that in the uniformly high temperature pre 
served in the laboratory they breed all the year around, and have no defi 
nite broods a few larvae appear at all times, though during the summer, 
when the beetles come in from the grounds and other parts of the museum, 
exposed specimens are attacked at more regular intervals. The rule is to 
keep naphthaline in all boxes at all times, but like all rules it is not always 
possible to adhere strictly to it. The boxes not so protected are usually 
first attacked. In a cabinet not quite tight I coned a number of drawers 
and left the others unprotected. In the course of the summer the unpro 
tected drawers nearly all became infested, while as a rule the others were 
free. The naphthaline seems to act as a repellant. I have found, however, 
that rt does not annoy the larvae to any very great extent, and Mr. Lugger has 
shown me a naphthaline cone in a hollow of which a larva had pupated! 
I have reason to believe, however, that it does retard the development of 
young larva. A large number of boxes nearly a hundred were received 
from North Carolina, containing a collection, principally Coleoptera. They 
were overhauled and found to be pretty generally infested with Trogo 
derma, this being the only species found. No Anthrenus larvae were no 
ticed. Bisulphide of carbon was freely used, and naphthaline cones were 
placed in all the boxes. For a while the boxes were frequently examined 
and no larvae developed. Throughout the summer the boxes were exam 
ined at intervals and remained free. With the approach of cold weather 



OF WASHINGTON. 115 

they were left for a longer period, and the cones pretty generally evapo 
rated. In December this was noticed and the boxes were again over 
hauled, and it was found that a very general development of larvae had 
begun all of them Trogoderma and none of them more than 2-3 mm. in 
length most of them apparently just hatched. The entire collection was 
then overhauled and an occasional Anthrenus larva was found, but no 
other Trogoderma, even in the most exposed boxes. 

I conclude from this that the collection when received was pretty gen 
erally infested, and that there were eggs everj'where, ready to develop; 
some had begun to develop, and these were destroyed by the use of the 
Bisulphide of Carbon, which also served to check development of the 
eggs. The boxes were quite large, and two large cones were put in each ; 
they were also quite secure, and the atmosphere in them was fully impreg 
nated with the odor of naphthaline. Throughout the summer, when under 
ordinary circumstances they would have developed, the eggs remained 
dormant, but after the naphthaline had evaporated completely, development 
began. I might add here that Trogoderma is an exceedingly rare pest in 
New York, and not common in Washington, further south it seems to 
replace Anthrenus. For all these pests, when out of the egg, Bisulphide 
of Carbon is a sovereign remedy, except where they are burrowing in large 
Coleoptera and Lepidoptera. I have repeatedly soaked large Bombycids 
with chloroform or bisulphide, and a week later found them still infested. 
I worked for a month over some large Lucanids (Proculejus} and finally 
separated the parts so that I could fill the body cavity with chloroform. 
In one case, which was somewhat exposed and contained odd material 01 
little value, I found a specimen destroyed by Microgaster a rare parasite 
for Anthrenus. How they got at this box it is rather difficult to explain, 
since it was tight enough to prevent the entrance of the insect. 

As a rule Anthrenus can hardly be considered fastidious, but occasion 
ally they manifest color preferences. In one specimen of Grapta inter- 
rogationis the black spots bordering on the costa were neatly cut out, no 
other portion of the wing being touched. Its career was suddenly cut 
short before it had quite finished one wing, and I now regret that I did not 
allow it to continue its work to note whether it would have attacked the 
other wing in the same manner. 

I have noticed also that boxes on the lower tier of shelves are very much 
more liable to attack than those on upper tiers, and this leads me to believe 
that the parent beetle will deposit eggs outside of the boxes or on the floor 
of the cases, and the young larvae will work their way into the smallest 
crevices. It seems difficult otherwise to account for isolated larvae in boxes 
containing only old insects. 

Finally I find the danger of infection comparatively greater at Washing 
ton than in New York principally because the warm season begins earlier 
and lasts longer, increasing the chances of infection. I find, too, that the 
only real chance of safety consists in constant examination, tight boxes 
and a free use of chloroform or Bisulphide of Carbon. 



116 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

As to naphthaline, I consider that it is a good general preventative. I 
know it to keep out Psocids and Ants. It enhances the tendency to grease 
and to verdigris, and in tight boxes it seems to exercise a relaxing tend 
ency, causing the wings to droop. 

Dr. Marx presented for publication the following description

Mr. Howard read a paper, of which he has submitted the fol 
lowing abstract : 

A MISCONCEPTION REGARDING THE LECONTE EDITION OF SAY. The 
title-page of the two-volume LeConte edition of Say reads: "The com 
plete writings of Thomas Savon the Entomology of North America," and 
from this wording of the title-page I have reason to believe that the im 
pression is very general that in this edition LeConte included all of the 
entomological papers written by the father of North American descriptive 
entomology. Such, at least, was my own impression. 

In 1884 I found in the Journal of the Academy of Sciences, .of Philadel 
phia, for August, 1817, vol. i, page 63, an interesting not by Say, which 
I have republished with comments in Psyche, vol. iv, page 206, August and 
September, 1884. I have recently found two other articles in the Memoirs 
of the Philadelphia Society for promoting Agriculture, vol. iv, 1818, the 
one a letter dated September 28, 1817, published upon page 224, and the 
other a letter dated October 30, 1817, published upon page 236. The find 
ing of these three articles lead me to the conclusion that the editor intended 

O 

simply to bring together descriptive papers of 'Say, and this conclusion is 
verified by a paragraph in Dr. LeConte 7 s preface. The title page is there 
fore very misleading, and the cause of a general misconception as to the 
,_-cope of the work on the part of entomologists. After the preparation of 
this note I discovered that the two letters of Say referred to have been men 
tioned by Dr. Hagen in Psyche for March, 1884. The U. S. Department 
of Agriculture possesses a copy of the now rather rare Memoirs of the Phila 
delphia Society above mentioned.

ANNUAL ADDRESS OF THE PRESIDENT. 

A COMMENCEMENT OF A STUDY OF THE PARASITES OF COSMOPOLITAN 

INSECTS. 

BY L. O. HOWARD. 

The desirability of a general compilation of the parasitic rela 
tions of all parasitic Hymenoptera has been forced upon me in my 
study of these forms, and I have for some time been engaged in 
recording in spare moments such relations wherever published, 
with a view of bringing out in two great tables the parasites and 
the insects from which they have been reared, arranged, first, ac 
cording to the classification of the parasites, and, second, accord 
ing to classification of the insects parasitized. Whenever, in 
making these records, the insect playing the part of host (victim 
seems a better word) has chanced, to my knowledge, to be a cos 
mopolite, or at least to occur in both Europe and North America, 
I have considered its parasites with greater interest, and the idea 
which I had long since conceived, and which I have not seen for 
mulated elsewhere, that the comparative study of the parasites of 
such species would be followed with results of considerable inter 
est, and possibly of some practical value, has occurred to me with 
added force. This recording has advanced so far at the present 
time that I have been able to accumulate sufficient facts for a pre 
liminary paper on this subject, which, it strikes me, is so broad 
in its interest and so well calculated to appeal to entomologists of 
all specialties that it is well adapted to an address of this kind. 

In advance of a consideration of the actual records it is obvious 
that a plain tabulated statement, such as I shall give, will be of 
use in the following ways : It will be a slight help in determina 
tion of parasites ; it will be an indication of possible synonymy

where names differ ; it will bring before the eye in comparison 
species which are vicarious, which represent each other in differ 
ent countries, although specifically distinct ; it will assist us towards 
a clearer idea as to the general habits (whether uniform or variable) 
of genera and other groups of parasites. These points, however, 
will of course be brought out in a much stronger manner by the 
tabulation of the entire records, although this present tabulation 
will assist in these directions. The table which follows, however, 
will form a record upon which to base the collection and importa 
tion of the parasites of a destructive species an attractive idea 
which has been often discussed in entomological writings, but 
seldom carried out with much practical success. Other uses for 
such a list will unquestionably arise, and, indeed, since writing 
the introductory -lines of this paper a most striking and interesting 
instance of the value of just such knowledge, in a way the pos 
sibility of which never even occurred to me, has been brought out 
by our fellow-member. Dr. Riley. The Hessian Fly has been 
very destructive for two years past in England, and the question 
has been, and it is an important one, whence did it come? Two 
important wheat-growing districts furnish England with much of 
this grain, viz.. North America and Russia. Now it happens that 
within a few months of each other Dr. Riley monographed the 
North American parasites of this insect, and Dr. Lindemann 
the Russian parasites. No accurate way of fixing the source of 
the English supply was found until Dr. Riley on his recent trip 
to England discovered that the parasites there were identical with 
the Russian forms, and, with one exception, specifically distinct 
from the American forms, the exception belonging to the Russian 
fauna as well as to the American. America is thus relieved of the 
onus which falls upon Russian shoulders. 

This paper will therefore subserve several objects, and if it were 
only tolerably complete its value would be considerable. The 
record is. however, incomplete and necessarily more or less inac 
curate. 

The European records fail in many instances to record the spe 
cies of the host, which often, and especially in case of Aphidid<z 
and Coccidce, usually having wide-spread species, debars us from 
much interesting information. There- such information is usually 
recorded in connnection with treatises on the structure and habits 



120 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

of the parasites, in which the specific determination of the host is 
of less importance. Here in America, however, owing to the fact 
that little has been written upon the habits or classification of par 
asites, such records occur almost entirely in works on the habits 
of the hosts, which are usually injurious insects, or at least showy 
ones well known to the popular eye, and in this case the specific 
determination of the parasite becomes the less important. Thus 
in Europe we have twenty or more parasites recorded from " bark- 
lice on oak," and these bark-lice may or may not be identical with 
species in this country, and, per contra, in this country we all 
know how often occurs the phrase, " a hymenopterous parasite 
lives in this insect," or " an ichneumonid parasite has been bred." 
From these two facts, tendencies, or necessities it will be readily 
seen that it is almost too early for generalizations. 

In the present state of our knowledge in America, perhaps no 
better can be done. In Europe there is less excuse ; specialists 
abound, the insect fauna is well known, and nothing but the in- 
tentness of the individual upon his own restricted group, and his 
carelessness as to others, and even to the close relations in life 
which they bear to other groups, prevents us from having much 
fuller records. Few lepidopterists, for instance, save the para 
sites which issue from larvaB in which they are interested. The 
parasites are to them such unmitigated nuisances, and their ap 
pearance is such a grievous disappointment, that, unless they 
chance to belong to some brilliant or striking species, they are 
thrown aside in disgust. Here, however, I must pay my respects 
to Messrs. Bridgman and Fitch, who have brought about a revival 
in England of late years in the direction of a reform of this abuse. 
At the present day there are many English lepidopterists who re 
ligiously save and record the parasites which they rear. 

This leads us naturally to the mention of the other entomologists 
whose records have been of assistance, and who have done the most 
in the study of the lives of parasites. 

Messrs. Bridgman and Fitch are well towards the top, and they 
have recorded a great many rearings in The Entomologist during 
the last eight years. 

Ratzeburg, in his great work on the Ichneumons of Forest In 
sects, recorded some eighteen hundred parasites and their hosts. 
It is difficult to use his observations, however, on account of 'the 



OF WASHINGTON. 121 

complicated synonymy, a large proportion of the species described 
by him as new having been described before. 

Kirchner, in his catalogue of the Hymenoptera of Europe, has 
brought together a great number of records of rearing of parasites, 
and repeats nearly all of Ratzeburg, but this part of his work was 
hurriedly done. 

Edouard Ferris, in his various papers, has recorded many para 
sites. These records have been brought together and published 
with the observations of Giraud, who was also a most industrious 
observer of the habits of parasites, under the caption " Liste d'ec- 
losions d'Insectes," by Giraud and Laboulbene, in the Annals of 
the French Society for 1877. 

Rheinhard and Hartig and Pastor Kawall in the Entomological 
Journal of Stettin, Westwood in the Transactions of the London 
Society, Snellen van Vollenhoven in his Finacographia, Curtis in 
his Farm Insects, Kaltenbach in his Enemies of Plants, Mayr in his 
short monographs published by the Imperial Zoological-Botanical 
Society of Vienna, Brischke in his various papers published by the 
Konigsberg Society, Buckton in his monograph of the Aphids, 
Wachtl in his short papers in the Vienna Entomological Journal, 
Cameron in recent papers published by the Glasgow Natural His

Dours in his Catalogue of the Hymenoptera of France, Marshall 
in his Monograph of the British Braconidas, Moller in the Entom, 
Tidskr., and G. C. Bignell in one of the Ray Society publications, 
have been the principal contributors to this branch of the subject 
in Europe, and the principal sources of the information which I 
have brought together. 

In this country the only attempt at a list or table is the short 
one prepared by myself and published in Bulletin 5 of the Division 
of Entomology. Nearly all of our records occur in isolated form 
in the writings of our economic entomologists. Riley has recorded 
more rearings than any other American author, in his Reports on 
the Insects of Missouri, in the American Entomologist, in his re 
ports as entomologist to theU. S. Department of Agriculture, in the 
reports to the U. S. Entomological Commission, and in the Trans. 
St. L. Acad. Sci., and in the Proc. Nat. Mus. Fitch, Harris, 
Walsh, Le Baron, Shimer, Norton, Emily A. Smith, French, 
Forbes, Lintner, Comstock, Packard, Ashmead, Cook, Weed, 
Hubbard, Patton, Provancher have all published a greater or lesser

number of such records. Mr. Ashmead has sent me a manuscript

many of which are as yet unpublished. Mr. Schwarz has kindly 
looked over my records of parasites of Coleoptera, and advised me 
concerning the cosmopolitan beetles, and Dr. Williston has assisted 

me in the same way with the Diptera.

Remarks on the address were made by Dr. Riley, Mr. Schwarz, 
and Mr. Smith. The unanimous thanks of the Society were then 
tendered Mr. Howard for his excellent paper. 



FEBRUARY 2, 1888. 

Seven persons present. President Schwarz in the chair. 

Mr. R. GodefTroy was elected a member of the Society. 

Dr. Fox read a paper " On Certain Genera of the Lycosida" 
discussing more particularly the genera Dolomedes and Ocyale. 
Attention was called to the conflicting descriptions of the genera 
as given by the standard authors, and particularly to the fact that 
no mention is made by any of them of the relative heighth of the 
cephalic portion of the cephalothorax. A comparative table was 
given showing in what respects the authors differed and in what 
they agreed in their generic descriptions or characters used. 

Mr. Smith mentioned that, while there was but a single named 
Dolomedes in the Museum collection, there were probably some 
species in the lot collected for the National Museum by Prof. 
Underwood last summer. That Prof. Underwood's intention 
was, if possible, to cover the old Hentz collecting grounds in 
Georgia and Alabama, and to get material to identify the Hentz 
species with what success remains to be seen. 

In response to a question by Mr. Schwarz, Dr. Fox gave the 
geographical distribution of the genus, and of some species, show 
ing a very extended range. This subject was briefly discussed by 
Messrs. Schwarz, Howard, and Fox. 

Mr. Howard asked whether, where a European genus was the're 
well marked^and constant, the definition should be enlarged to in 
clude American forms which showed some one particular character 
not present in the European species. 

Mr. Schwarz replied affirmatively, and cited the differences in 
the genus Pterostichus as an example of what had been done in 
Coleoptera. Mr. Smith cited the Noctuid genus Perigrapha, 
the European species of which have pectinated antennae in the 
female, while in the American forms the antennae are simple ; the 
genus, however, being the same in other respects, the American

forms were included under the same generic term. Mr. Howard 
said this agreed with his ideas on the subject. 
Mr. Heidemann made the following 

REMARKS ON THE HEMIPTERA COLLECTED BY MR. SCHWARZ 
IN DADE Co., FLORIDA. 

BY O. HHIDEMANN. 

The material collected by Mr. Schwarz is now in the hands of Prof. Uhler, 
in Baltimore, who has promised to determine it and to make a list of 
the species. 

I recently spent an afternoon in looking over Prof. Uhler's large collec 
tions, and also obtained from him considerable information about these 
interesting insects. There appear to be about 95 species altogether, every 
one of which belongs to the fauna of Cuba, San Domingo, or some other 
part of the West Indies. All but four or five obscure little Aradidce and 
Capsidce and a few Pentatomidce are well known and described. 

Among the Pentatomidce were Eusclristus variolaris Pal. Beauv., and a 
Nezara, which I made out to be Say's Pentatoma abrupta, now ranked as 
a synonym of Nezara pennsylvamca De Geer. Prof. Uhler said that the 
insect was a typical specimen of N. pennsylvanica. N. hilaris, which is 
quite common in the vicinity of Washington, differs in having the hind 
angles of the pronotum triangular instead of rounded. 

It would be interesting to know more certainly the geographical distri 
bution of these species how far they may extend beyond southern Florida. 

As soon as \ receive a list of the species I hope to be able to give more 
and better information concerning them. 

Mr. Smith, referring to the character of this fauna, stated that 
among the Lepidoptera, so far as they had been studied, the West 
Indian fauna predominates, and in his opinion they really belong 
to this fauna, and not to that of temperate North America. He 
would not add them to our catalogues for that reason. 

Mr. Schwarz said that this fauna extends much further north 
than is generally supposed. He finds considerable difficulty in 
determining the species, but gradually, as he succeeds in working 
them up, he finds that they all belong to the West Indian or Cen 
tral American fauna. 

Mr. Howard mentioned that among the specimens brought home 
by Mr. Schwarz are some short-winged chinch bugs, peculiar in 
having quite sharply-pointed elytra. He has seen the same form 
from other localities, always from the sea-shore, and he believes 
that it is a sea-coast form. 



138 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

Mr. Schwarz read the following paper : 

ON XYLEBORUS PYRI AND AN UNDESCRIBED ALLIED SPECIES. 

BY E. A. SCHWARZ. 

The galleries made by Scolytid beetles are divided into such as are more 
or less between the bark and the outermost layers of wood, and such as 
enter the solid wood. Those of the former class are readily investigated 
and described, and the burrows of quite a number of our native species have 
been made known, although only a small proportion have been illustrated by 
figures. The Scolytids of the second class that bore into the solid wood are 
much less numerous, and their galleries much more difficult to investigate. 
To fully illustrate their work two figures are necessary, viz., a transverse 
section of the branch or trunk containing the galleries, and a longitudinal 
section through the burrows. Only very few of these species have hitherto 
been described by American authors, c. g., Gnaihotrichus materiarius and 
Monarthrum malt, by Dr. A. Fitch ; Corthylns, punctatisshnus, by Dr. C. 
H.Merriam, while two or three other species have been briefly referred to. 
The most frequently mentioned example of this class is the Pear-blight 
beetle, Xyleborus pyri, of which W. D. Peck published an account as early 
as 1817 (Mass. Agric. Jour., iv, no. iii, pp. 205-207). His account is 
quoted, in abstract, by Dr. Harris (Treat. Ins. Inj. to Vegt, Flint ed., p. 
91), and has been faithfully copied by every subsequent writer whenever 
there was an opportunity to refer to the Pear-blight beetle. In view of 
the knowledge we now possess of the life-history of Scolytids, through the 
investigations of Ratzeburg, Perris, Altum. Eichhoff, and others, it seems 
strange that no one has ever pointed out the errors in Peck's account. He 
starts with the statement, that the female beetle deposits the egg in the bark, 
a statement which is erroneous, since all Scolytids, without exception, 
oviposit within their galleries. Then he proceeds to describe the gal 
lery as consisting of a somewhat winding passage leading through the bark 
into the wood, and turning around the core of the twig concentric with the 
bark. This description is imperfect, and shows that Peck made only a 
transverse section of the twig. Had he made a longitudinal section he 
would have noticed that this long gallery is intersected vertically by a 
number of shorter galleries. That these vertical galleries exist is evident 
from remarks by Dr. Harris, which he adds, without further comment, to 
his quotation of Peck's account. 

The galleries of Xyleborus pyrt when completed must be very similar to 
or identical with those of the allied European X. dispar as figured by 
Eichhoff (Europ. Borkenk.. p. 280), and I have myself on a former occasion 
expressed the belief that these two species are specifically identical ; in other 
words, that our pear-blight beetle would prove to be an old importation 
from the Old World. The burrows of all Scolytids which enter the solid 
wood are constructed after the same principle, at least so far as known to 
us. Only a single species is known to form a notable exception, viz., the 
European X. Saxeseni, which, without making any galleries whatever,

hollows out a large chamber, wherein the eggs are deposited and the 
larvae mature. Another very similar exception I was fortunate to discover 
last year in southern Florida. While in Key West I found about the 
middle of April on the cocoa plum ( Chrysobalanus. icaco) a single specimen 
of an undescribed Xyleborus belonging to the pyri group. Two weeks 
later, while staying at Cocoanut Grove, Biscayne Bay, I found on the same 
tree another much smaller and otherwise quite distinct specimen in which 
I recognized the male of the species found at Key West. I began now a 
careful investigation of the dead branch (from a tree cut down some weeks 
previously) upon which the specimen was found, and which was about 12 
mm. in diameter. Holes of the requisite size and leading straight into the 
wood I found plenty, but they were either emptv or occupied by a specimen 
of the polyphagous Hypothenemus eruditus, which seems to construct these 
holes only for feeding purposes, as 1 never found any egg chamber or 
larvae. Finally I found an entrance-hole which for nearly two millimetres 
went straight into the wood, then there came a short elbow downward, and 
then it was rather suddenly enlarged into a capacious chamber of irregu 
lar oval shape, which reached to within the core of the branch. In this 
chamber there was one pair of the Xyleborus, and on its lower innermost 
corner another smaller chamber opened of more elongate shape, and being 
entirely within the core. This smaller chamber proved to be the "nursery," 
as on its bottom 1 found a number of eggs laid in ^ heap and some recently 
hatched larvae. I hope to describe the species at a future opportunity and 
propose to name it after its food plant.

Thirteen persons present. President Schwarz in the chair. 

The chairman of the Publication Committee presented a copy 
of the Proceedings, No. 2. 

Prof. Riley presented a paper entitled "A Contribution to the 
Literature of Fatal Spider Bites."* He mentioned the common im 
pression that such cases are of frequent occurrence, on the one hand, 
and the disbelief, as common among Arachnologists, on the other, 
and then gave details of a case that had recently come to his at 
tention from Greensboro, N. C. , where a specimen of Latrodectus 
mactans caused the death of a farm hand. He concluded with a 
review of the literature of the subject. 

Mr. Lugger mentioned a case of poisoning by a spider which 
happened some four years since in his own family. In very early 
spring, before vegetation had become very active, his little

daughter was amusing herself by spinning the wheel of an old 
toy wheelbarrow which had been lying about since the preced 
ing fall. Suddenly she cried out in great pain that a spider had 
bitten her. Soon afterward she fainted and was convulsed with 
pain. The spider, which was caught and proved to be Phydippus 
tripunctatus L., had bitten one of her fingers, which showed 
very plainly two little holes close together. The space in the 
immediate vicinity was white, but a bright red color surrounded 
it and gradually extended over the entire arm. The bitten spot 
was frequently washed with diluted liquid ammonia. After pass 
ing through a number of convulsions with intense symptoms of 
fever, headache, swollen eyes, and great pain in the pit of the 
bitten arm, the girl gradually grew better, and after about three 
days all inflammation had disappeared. 

Dr. Marx commented on the case, and the importance of thor 
oughly investigating all the circumstances, before deciding that 
death really occurred from the spider's bite. It has been con 
tended that it was almost impossible for Latrodectus to kill ; the 
mandibles are so minute and soft that, even if they could pierce, 
it would seem as if they could hold scarcely venom enough to do 
any harm. He hoped, with Dr. Fox, to carry on some experi 
ments on this point. He would not be too hasty in applying 
ammonia as an antidote, since it was really not settled whether 
the venom was an acid or an alkali. 

Mr. Lugger said it turned blue litmus paper red. Continuing, 
Dr. Marx said that in homoeopathy some spiders w r ere used 
medicinally. He described the habits of a Latrodectus mactans 
kept by him in captivity, describing the method of enveloping its 
victim in a viscid fluid which rapidly hardens into a gauzy tex 
ture. This he had removed on one occasion, and swallowed, 
with the effect of increasing the pulse from 72 to 120; a second 
experiment produced the same results. 

Mr. Lugger said that he had been bitten by Lycosa on several 
occasions without unpleasant results. He had taken many La 
trodectus mactans, but had never been bitten. 

Mr. Schwarz, commenting on the case described by Prof. 
Riley, does not consider it conclusive by any means. No one 
had seen the spider which bit the man, and the specimen sent 
was supposed to be like that which bit another man. 



OF WASHINGTON. 141 

Mr. Dodge said that Dr. Palmer was bitten on one occasion 
on the hand, and three months after, when he saw it, the hand 
was very much puffed up and inflamed, and in a very ugly con 
dition, though Dr. Palmer said it was then very much better, and 
was healing. 

Mr. Schwarz suggested permanganate of potash as a remedy. 

Judge Johnson said that he had once upon a time investigated 
a number of spider-bite cases, but without ever getting any posi 
tive proof, so he had never published the result. 

Dr. Marx said that he had investigated one case of a supposed 
death from spider bite in Washington, D. C., which resulted in 
showing that the victim had gone to sleep at night and had 
awakened in the morning with a pustule on the neck, which 
rapidly inflamed and enlarged, and eventually caused death. No 
one had seen any spider, and the assumption that there had been 
one was utterly unfounded, yet the case was published everywhere 
as an undoubted One. 

Dr. Fox thinks there is probably some basis for some of the 
accounts, and thinks that under some physical conditions the bite 
might become dangerous. 

Mr. C. R. Dodge exhibited impressions from some of Glover's 
early plates, and gave an account of Glover's experiments in various 
methods of engraving on stone and metal, and of his manner and 
system of work. 

There was some discussion on the drawings shown, and on the 
relative value of the various processes in producing good entomo 
logical results. In this Messrs. Marx, Schwarz, Smith and Lug 
ger took part. 

Mr. Howard presented a note describing an external parasite on 
a spider found by Dr. Fox about the middle of February.* 

Mr. Schwarz said that to him the most interesting point was 
the season at which this parasite was found. It was so early in 
the spring that it seemed scarcely likely that it had attained its 
present development from an egg deposited this season. The in 
ference was that it had hibernated with its host. 

There was considerable general discussion on external para 
sitism, and the possibility of molting in the larva so infested. Mr.

Lugger described more fully the way in which the parasite was 
attached to the spider. Dr. Marx described the ways in which 
spiders molt, and Dr. Fox detailed the circumstances under which 
the specimen was found.

OBSERVATIONS UPON THE HETEROPTERA COLLECTED IN SOUTHERN 
FLORIDA BY MR. E. A. SCHWARZ. 

BY P. R. UHLER. 

Through the kindness of Mr. Otto Heidemann I have been permitted to 
examine the interesting collection of Hemiptera made in the extreme south 
ern part of Florida by that ardent student and acute collector of Coleoptera, 
Mr. E. A. Schwarz. 

This collection throws much additional light upon the insect fauna of that 
peculiar portion of our southern territory, and enables us to perceive with 
greater distinctness the West Indian and Neotropical characteristics of that 
country. South of Indian River, more particularly, the types of this fauna 
appear, and upon the border land most influenced by heat and moisture 
they form a decidedly distinct feature of the insect assemblage. Genera 
such as Diolcus, Loxa, Vulsirea, Edessa, Spartocera, Catorhintha, Jly- 
aly menus, Pthia, Jadera, Lasiochila, Zelus, and Mononyx are here repre 
sented by conspicuous examples, and species of other genera which are 
common in San Domingo, Cuba, Mexico, and Central America are not 
less numerous in this region. 

Certain- Nearctic and widely distributed genera, such as Homcemus, Pan- 
gcetts, Euschistus, Mormidea, CEdancala, Ligyrocoris, Emblethis, Nysius, 
Pygolampis, Aradtis, Aneurus, Galguhis, etc., are also present in the or 
dinary numbers, and show that the North American continental forms of 
Hemiptera, although having had the usual struggle with widely varying 
climatic conditions, have been able to hold their place in spite of compe 
tition with the new comers from more southern lands. From the abun 
dance, variety, and instability of the assemblage of species now known to 
inhabit the region extending from Central America to Southern Colorado, 
we are induced to believe that the principal part of our United States 
Hemipterous fauna has been derived from that quarter. Nearly all the 
genera and species, excepting only the high-mountain and cold weather 
forms, thus far found in the country between the Great Lakes of Canada 
and the alluvial belt south of Tennessee occur quite abundantly in Mexico 
and the adjoining countries. 

The time at the disposal of Mr. Schwarz was too short to allow full col 
lections of the species of this region to be secured ; but the 95 species which 
were taken, together with those brought together by the industry of former 
collectors, enable a fairly correct estimate to be made of the character and 
peculiarities of the Hemipterous fauna of the region. A singular absence 
of Capsiiice is to be noticed in this collection, and there are also no speci-

mens of the common Cyrtomenus, Stiretrus, and other conspicuous forms. 
Among the Tingitidce is a representative of the South American genus 
Acanthochila, heretofore not discovered in North America, which we con 
sider important enough to describe in this place. 

ACANTHOCHILA Stal. 

A. exquisita. New sp. Form similar to that of Gargaphia ; ovate, the 
wing-covers transparent throughout, excepting the clavus and adjoining 
field of the corium ; abdomen and pectus black, the former polished, the 
latter opaque; head rounded, impunctate, set with rows of minute bris 
tles, unarmed ; vertex grooved, having a white carina each side at the 
suture bounding the inner side of the eyes; eyes round, brown ; antennae 
testaceous, moderately slender, rather longer than the head and thorax 
combined ; clavate, the basal joint very thick, shorter than the head, armed 
with stout, strong bristles ; the second joint almost as thick, bristly, sub- 
conical ; third, very long, slender, set with slender erect hairs; fourth, 
fusiform, not as thick as the basal ones, but longer than both conjoined, 
bristly, with the apical half blackish ; bucculse testaceous or ochreous; 
rostrum and tylus ochreous, the former extending behind the middle 
coxae ; thorax either ochreous or blackish, with ochreous lateral network, 
the surface with remote sunken punctures, and short, sparse setae; lateral 
margins slightly expanded into curved lobes, with a series of five quad 
rangular cells each side, and having the outer edge armed with six or seven 
long acute spines tipped with black; anterior lobe small, deeply indented, 
bearing a slender pale carina along the middle, which is less distinctly 
carried back on the posterior lobe; the posterior lobe dull, trapezoidal, 
sub-acutely deltoid behind, white at tip; pectoral pieces more or less mar- 
fined with testaceous; the ante-pectoral flaps remotely granulated ; legs 
;staceous, clothed with slender bristles ; scutellum minute, black, covered 
it base by the truncated tip of the produced pronotum ; hemelytra coria- 
:eous throughout, an oval area at base, which includes the clavus; this 
>ortion is coarsely sunken punctate ; exterior to this the sagense have 
two, or at most three, series of net-work areoles, which increase in size 
)osteriorly, so that six series of irregular rhomboidal cells form the whole 
,-idth of the corium behind the middle; the costal margin has a series of 
about seventeen gradually diminishing spines, extending from the con 
tracted base to beyond the middle; the veins of the surface generally set 
with minute bristles throughout; length to tip of abdomen 2j, to end of 
hemelytra 3-3^ millims. ; width across the pronotum scarcely i millim. 

Only four specimens of this interesting insect were present in this col 
lection, three of which were females and the fourth a male. The male is 
more transparent, and has more clean cut black markings than any of the 
females. 

The specimens were found near Cape Florida in the month of May. 

Mr. Schwarz stated that as to the Coleoptera the derivation of 



144 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

the United States fauna is different and the South Floridian is no 
part of it, as he would show later. 

Mr. Smith made some remarks on the characters of the family 
Heterogynidce and the species recently placed in it by Mr. Ed 
wards. He does not believe it really occurs with us.

Twelve persons present. President Schwarz in the chair. 

Mr. Schwarz, from the Publication Committee, reported that 
by an error in proof-reading the record of the election of Mr. 
Ashmead, on August 4, 1887, was omitted. 

Dr. G. H. Horn made some remarks on the genus Pleocoma 
and its place in the Lamellicorn system.* He exhibited a slide 
showing the location of the stigmata on the connecting membrane, 
and proving that Dr. LeConte was correct in his location of the 
genus. He criticises Gerstaecker's paper, recently translated by 
Mr. Smith,| and shows that, convincing as it seems, it is based 
on a positive error of observation. He also believes now that 
the larva described by Osten-Sacken really belongs to this genus. 

Dr. Horn further exhibited a larva of Platypsyllus mounted in 
balsam. This, he stated, was of extreme interest, since it posi 
tively proved the coleopterous nature of the insect. The larva is 
truly coleopterous, with well developed mandibles, which are 
shed in the imago stage, and this is the only known instance of 
the loss of the mandibles in a coleopteron. In a paper now in 
press, | he describes, and figures the larva, and speaks more at 
length of its structure. 

Prof. Riley said he had been extremely interested in Dr. Horn's 
last communication, as he had had the larva of Platypsyllus on 
his desk for some eighteen months, intending, as soon as he could 
get to it, to publish the discovery. They had been collected for 
him by Mr. Bruner, near West Point, Nebraska, and from the 
examination made by him upon their receipt he had concluded

them coleopterous beyond a doubt. He had never questioned in 
his own mind the accuracy of Dr. LeConte's conclusions, but the 
discovery of the larva definitely confirmed them. 

Mr. Lugger asked whether the pupa had been found. Dr. 
Horn said he had not received it. Prof. Riley was not certain 
whether or not it was among his material. 

Mr. Schwarz read a paper on the semi-tropical insect fauna of 
Florida, with special reference to the Coleoptera, of which the 
following is an abstract :* 

While the insect fauna of the southwestern extremity of North America 
has been tolerably well studied, very little has hitherto been known of the 
insect fauna of southern Florida. That there existed in south Florida a 
small colony of West Indian forms has long been known, but quite a num 
ber of species have also been described as being peculiar to that section. 
From a study of a collection of Coleoptera made last year in southeastern 
Florida Mr. Schwarz has come to the conclusion that this section has no 
peculiar fauna and that the West Indian colony is much richer in species 
than has hitherto been supposed. Besides this semi-tropical colony south 
ern Florida harbors a large number of widely distributed species, while 
the true Floridian fauna is but poorly represented. The presence of this 
West Indian colony is solely due to the influence of the Gulf Stream, which 
favors the importation of West Indian plants and insects into the southern 
extremity of Florida, but prevents the extension of the fauna and flora of 
the North American continent into the West Indies. This immigration 
of West Indian forms not only takes place from Cuba, the nearest of the 
West Indian islands, but from all parts of Central America which are 
brought under the influence of the Gulf stream, namely, all of the islands 
and the coast of the Central American continent south of the peninsula of 
Yucatan. To the same agency is due the fact that the West Indian colony 
in Florida is composed o-nly of such species as, in the imago or prepar 
atory stages, are capable of sustaining the transportation by sea from the 
West Indies. Hence the total or almost total absence of many families 
among the West Indian colony, e. g., Carabidae, rhypophagous Clavicor- 
nia, Scarabseidae, Lampyridae and Chrysomelidse, and the predominance 
of such forms as live under bark or within the wood, e. g., the Rhyn- 
chophora. Cerambycidce, Ptinidae, etc. All these semi-tropical species 
have founded a permanent colony in Florida, because their original food 
plants which form the semi-tropical hammock of southern Florida have 
also firmly and permanently established themselves on the North Amer 
ican continent. It is evident, therefore, that the extent of this West In-

146 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

dian colony is coincident with that of the semi-tropical forest, and Mr. 
Schwarz pointed out that in southeastern Florida this forest occupies the 
chain of the Keys, and small, more or less widely separated spots on the 
mainland as far north as the head of Biscayne Bay. It is northwardly 
continued, however, immediately along the shore in island-like, usually 
very small, spots as far as Cape Malabar. According to the botanists the 
same conditions prevail on the southwestern coast, where the semi-trop 
ical forest extends always immediately along the coast as far north as 
Tampa Bay. In the interior there is no semi-tropical forest except on the 
few Keys in the Everglades. This character of the semi-tropical fauna of 
Florida and its peculiar distribution is in marked contrast with the exten 
sion of the semi-tropical fauna into the southwestern extremity of North 
America. 

The immigration of West Indian forms into Florida took place at a quite 
recent geological period and is, in fact, still going on, but must not be 
confounded with that immigration from the south which took place at the 
end of the glacial period and which shaped the character of the present 
fauna of North America. 

Mr. Schwarz finally argued the point whether or not it would be advis 
able to include these semi-tropical species in the catalogues and monographs 
of North American insects. An inclusion of the whole Central American 
fauna is evidently impracticable, but a complete exclusion is also most in 
convenient. Mr. Schwarz agrees with Mr. Smith that only those species 
should be included which are found breeding in our territory ; but this 
would practically include the whole of the semi-tropical Coleopterous 
fauna occurring in Florida, and it would seem advisable to add still an 
other restriction, viz., to exclude all those forms which in their character 
strongly contrast with the nearest representatives of the North American 
fauna and which would occupy a more or less isolated place in our mon 
ographs and synopses. 

Dr. Horn, commenting on Mr. Schwarz's paper, said he agreed 
with him in his ideas of the derivation of this fauna. He had been 
watching it for some time, and had often been in doubt whether 
the species should or should not be included in our lists. He 
thinks not, when they introduce confusing material into our fauna, 
though species in truly temperate genera might easily be included. 
On the question of distribution he cites the fauna of Guadalupe 
Island. Here a current runs south from Alaska along the 
Pacific coast to Point Concepcion, is here deflected, and finally 
strikes Guadalupe off South California. Along the whole region 
the fauna is similar, and he believes is largely governed by this 
current. He also showed why the political boundary between 
the United States and Mexico was also nearly a natural one for 



OF WASHINGTON. 147 

two distinct faunas, and showed how by a series of deserts, moun 
tain chains and wedge-shaped valleys the Coleopterous fauna of 
the two countries was well separated. 

Prof. Riley thinks that Mr. Schwarz omits an important factor 
in distribution, viz., the wind. He cited a number of species 
picked up far from land, and evidently carried by the wind. As 
a curiosity in distribution he cited the case of Hornia minutipen- 
nis, which he received from Fresno Co., Cal., living with an 
undescribed species of Anthophora. 

Dr. Horn has no idea how this species could become so wide 
spread unless it followed the distribution of a particular bee. 

Prof. Riley thinks this the remnant of an ancient type, which 
by reason of its parasitic habits has undergone little or no change. 

Mr. Schwarz said this is the only Meloid occurring on both 
sides of the Continent. 



MAY 3, 1888. 

Eleven members present. President Schwarz in the chair. 

Mr. Tyler Townsend was elected Corresponding Secretary of 
the Society, vice Mr. O. Lugger, resigned. 

The discussion of Mr. Schwarz's paper was then in order, and 
the Secretary read the preceding abstract to inform members. 

Mr. Mann thinks that Mr. Schwarz's proposed restrictions to 
the admission of this fauna into our lists good and necessary. 

Dr. Fox thinks that the rule as to spiders would be too strict, 
and suggests that it may be necessary to make special rules for 
each order. 

Mr. Smith gave a review of some portions of the Lepidopterous 
fauna of this region, which in general is limited much as described 
by Mr. Schwarz for Coleoptera. A few of the species have 
spread into Northern Florida, and Southern Georgia. Unfortu 
nately the fauna is not so well known in the Lepidoptera, and many 
of the species from Florida have no definite locality. As a whole, 
he agrees thoroughly with Mr. Schwarz in his ideas. 

Mr. Schwarz said he omitted from his remarks all reference to 
those strong flyers whose occasional presence in more remote 
localities is due to this power. Dr. Merriam had informed him 



148 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

that the sub-tropical avifauna had precisely the same distribution 
which he had found for Coleoptera. 

Judge Johnson stated that the West Indian flora, so far as he 
had observed it, did not extend far into the interior of Florida, 
but extends north on the west coast as far as Tampa Bay. 

Dr. Marx reviewed the spiders collected by Mr. Schwarz, and 
finds that of the 26 'species collected by him one only is tropi 
cal, 7 are common throughout the United States, and 18 are like 
the usual Southern United States forms. In fact, this collection 
is peculiar for the large proportion of Northern forms. Ccntru- 
rus biaculeatus, a scorpion found by Mr. Schwarz, is found also 
in South America and Africa. 

Mr. Schwarz said that he estimated the number of semi-tropi 
cal Coleoptera in Florida at from 250 to 300 species. He does 
not believe that the wind has much to do with the distribution, 
because it is prevailingly east and west at the seasons when the 
insects might possibly be carried there. 

Mr. Smith gave the characters and affinities of the genus Cy- 
dosia,* which he finds a true Arctiid, allied to Cerathosia. He 
also gave some notes on the habits of Lachnosterna, as observed 

o ' 

by him, and stated that the species are unusually abundant this 
year. 

Dr. Marx showed the figure of an abnormal Scorpion, having 
only a single joint to the metatarsus ; also a figure of a Lycosa 
in which the middle row of eyes has disappeared. 

Mr. Howard showed two plates of genitalia drawings from 
Mr. Scudder's forthcoming work on the Butterflies of New Eng 
land. 

Mr. Smith stated that he had looked over these with great in 
terest ; he was well acquainted with the forms of these organs as 
found in the Macro-Heterocera, but had never carefully exam 
ined the Rhopalocera. Some of the figures none were named 
bear a striking resemblance to the form usual in the Sphingidce*

ON THE TYPES OF TOMICUS LIMINARIS, HARRIS. 

BY E. A. SCHWARZ. 

Afour meeting held in December, 1887 (p. 113), I expressed my suspicion 
that Dr. Harris had probably confounded Phloeotribus liminaris and Hy 
lesinus opaculus in his description and account of the former species. I 
came to this conclusion from the fact that Harris mentions Peach and Elm 
as the food-plants of his species, whereas, in my experience, the species 
under Elm bark is Hylesinus opaculus. I was, of course, unable then to as 
sert positively that Harris had confounded these two species which so 
closely resemble each other, but, through the kindness of Mr. Samuel 
Henshaw, I had lately the opportunity to examine Harris' type of/*, limi 
naris, and I also received through him a transcript of Harris' notes to the 
numbers in his cabinet. Harris had three specimens under the name of 
Tomicus liminaris, and his notes thereto read as follows : 

" No. 521. Miss Morris finds it in bark of Peach trees, and thinks it the 
cause of Yellows ; imago in August and September. 

"No. 821. Mr. Leonard, 2 [February?], 31, Dublin, N. H., No. 307. 

"No. 1007. Under bark of Elm, Milton [Mass.] " 

Specimen No. 521 is the true Phlceotribus liminaris; No. 821 is Poly- 
graphus rufipennis. How Dr. Harris came to place this among his Tomi 
cus liminaris is more than I can explain. No. 1007 is undoubtedly Hyle 
sinus opaculus, and proves that my suspicion was well founded. 

It may be of some interest to append here Dr. Harris' notes on the other 
species of Scolytidce in his collection, a copy of which I owe to Mr. Hen 
shaw :

NOTES ON PRONUBA AND YUCCA POLLINATION.* 
BY PKOF. C. V. RILEY. 

Partly because of more pressing duties, partly because of a desire to make 
some special experiments, but chiefly in the hope that (after the fruiting 
season of the dehiscent Yuccas was over, and Mr. Hulst had been able to 
make more careful observations) he would himself gracefully amend his 
opinions to accord with the facts, I have deferred answering till now the 
remarks by Mr. Hulst on pp. 236-238 of vol. ii, Ent. Amer. The matter 
is too important to drop, and I have too much regard for my critic person 
ally, and hope for his future entomologically, not to do what little I can to 
check an unfortunate tendency to hasty work and conclusion, noticeable in 
this as in some other of his late writings. 

Mr. Hulst "confesses the corn" in reference to my first complaint, and 
is inclined to blame the report for his misrepresentations an inclination 
which would have more of my sympathy were he not editor of the paper. 

It is, however, far more important, from the scientific side, that he con 
fess to the justness of my second indictment, and it is to this end that I 
return to the subject. 

Mr. Hulst adheres to his belief " that there must be very extensive fer 
tilization of the dehiscent species of Yucca by the agencies of bees and 
other insects." He does not bring forth a single definite fact or observa 
tion of actual pollination to prove or sustain the belief, but rests it on the 
following grounds : 

ist. That Meehan found that the mere application of pollen to the papil 
lose apex of the stigma is sufficient for fertilization. 

2d. That he (Hulst) has seen honey-bees within the open as well as the 
partly open flowers, as also other insects, Aphides and Coccinellidae being 
particularly mentioned. 

3d. That not one in ten of the capsules subsequently examined by him 
showed the larva. 

4th. That he is informed that dehiscent species of Yucca do ripen seeds 
in Europe. 

Such are the negative arguments upon which he rests his belief in the face 
of all \ho, facts I have put on record. Let us consider the former briefly 
in their order. 

ist. My good friend Meehan has written much on the fertilization of 

* In explanation of the controversial nature of this communication, it 
becomes necessary to refer to a dispute on this subject between the Rev. 
G. D. Hulst and myself in the columns of Entomologica Americana dur 
ing the summer of 1887. The communication is a reply to Mr. Hulst's last 
publication on the subject, and is presented verbatim et literatim as writ 
ten on my way to Europe in August of that year, and as mailed to him 
from England. Mr. Hulst is editor of the aforesaid journal, and exercised 
his editorial prerogative in declining to publish the communication. I have, 
therefore, concluded to present the paper to the Society, since it discusses 
matters of considerable scientific interest.

Yucca much, too, that has not shown the keenest penetration nor the 
strictest accuracy. But, in candidly admitting his errors when shown to 
be wrong (as he has done to the writer and, I have reason to believe, to 
Mr. Hulst, who sought his support in the belief here combated), he has 
proved himself to be the true naturalist. I am familiar with his experi 
ments, having witnessed the results, and can best express my own opin 
ion by quoting from a letter from the late Dr. G. Englemann (written Jan. 
10, 1881), in which among other things he says : * * * "As to Mee- 
han's operations I have seen myself the fine, large, well-filled pods of 
Yucca angustifolia raised by him by his artificial method. He says he 
punches an anther into the stigmatic cavity. Whether he or anybody 
else could distinguish whether the pollen adheres only to the papillose 
(not stigmatose) apex or gets into the liquor that fills the cavity when the 
stigma is ready to conceive, is a question (or no question)!" Meehan's 
experiments were made on a 'species in which, as I have elsewhere shown, 
the stigma is shorter and the stigmatic liquor more abundant than in 
Yucca filamentosa, and it may be that for these or other reasons it is more 
easily pollinized by hand or by other means than by Pronuba. But I have 
followed up his experiments and made many others during the past seven 
years, on filamentosa and aloifolia, with results that convince me that ap 
plication of the pollen to the papillose apices only is not sufficient to in 
sure fructification, at least in those species. My experiments have been 
made in the afternoon, evening, and morning; with flowers one day, two 
days, and three days after opening; with pollen from the same flower or 
from other flowers either on the same or other racemes; by touching the 
mere apices with anther or brush, and by forcing the pollen by either con 
veyance into the stigmatic tube. In these experiments, which have not 
yet been published, and which it is unnecessary to detail here, I have 
endeavored to guard against all influences, such as the condition of 
the plant and the weather, which might affect or vitiate, the results. These 
may be summed up thus : 

(1) Dr. Engelmann's limit of time during which fertilization may take 
place must be extended so as to include the second evening, and even the 
second morning, after the opening of the flower. 

(2) No seed has been produced by merely touching the apices of the stigma 
with the pollen, though partial fertilization may take place and cause the 
growth of the fruit for a varying period, generally only three or four days. 
When the pollen is thrust into the tube (the mode of conveyance making 
little difference) fertilization is much more certain, but even here is rarely 
sufficient to produce ripe seed, the upper part of the pod often filling well, 
but the basal part not filling, and at last withering so that the fruit ulti 
mately falls off before ripening. 

The conclusion is inevitable that angustifolia is more susceptible to arti 
ficial pollination than the species which I experimented with, and that 
Pronuba far excels man in the perfection with which she performs the act. 
She has the power of fertilizing all the ovules, at which nb one will wonder 
who has carefully watched her, because the act of pollination is normally

repeated several times, first from one of the angles between the apices, then 
from another, and, as Prof. Wm. Trelease has shown, the tongue is used, 
in addition to the tentacles, to push the pollen down to the bottom of the 
tube. 

2d. I have made careful search the past summer, and have had my asso 
ciates, Messrs. Howard, Pergande, and Lugger, assist in the search for 
honey-bees in or about the Yucca flowers in Washington. There were over 
200 stalks under observation, most of them of easy access on the grounds 
of the Department of Agriculture. Neither of the three gentlemen men 
tioned detected any bees, but I succeeded on two occasions, and each time 
between 9 and 10 a. m., in finding a single bee flying about the flowers. In 
neither case did the bee make any attempt to enter, but in each it probed 
around the outer base of the flower in search for nectar, and soon left 
evidently without being able to get much. These facts I record, not in 
any way to cast discredit on Mr. Hulst's statement, but rather to show 
how very different from his own has been my experience in this direction, 
both in St. Louis and Washington. Not that I place much faith in the 
constancy of bees, which are known to be somewhat fickle in their tastes 
according to season or colony, a fact that ma^y account for the difference in 
our experience, as may also the presumption that Apis mellifica is more 
abundant in Brooklyn than in Washington, or, again, the known fact that 
Tucca angustifolia is less scant in nectar than its filamentose congener. 
Be that as it may, our Apis has plainly, so far as observed, been after nec 
tar, and has shown no disposition whatever to go near the stigma, and this 
fact is, as I have learned, corroborated by Professors Cook and Beal, of the 
Michigan State Agricultural College, where, for the first time this year, 
they have observed honey-bees about the Yucca flowers. It is further cor 
roborated by experiment which I made this summer of confining bees to 
the flowers within a gauze enclosure. 

As for pollination by other insects, Chauliognathus pennsylvauicus, 
which feeds on both pollen and the nectar, is the most common species 
found in the flowers, and by virtue of these habits and its peculiarly modi 
fied mouth-parts, is most to be suspected ; yet I have carefully watched it 
for years, only to be convinced that it never either assists or competes with 
Pronuba in the act of pollination. 

3d. This argument has already been disposed of in my previous commu 
nication (vol. ii, p. 238, summary iv), and it is only necessary to add, that 
until Mr. Hulst is more exact, and will tell us what proportion of his pods 
containing no larvae also showed no signs of oviposition (i. e., how many 
were perfect without sign of puncture or constriction or irregularity about 
the middle), we shall not even know how many the little moth pollinized 
without getting a chance to perform the other (to her) important act. 

4th. This is contrary to my own experience in Europe, and to all au 
thoritative record familiar to me, and until Mr. Hulst gives us his authority 
and the evidence, it were shere waste of time to further discuss the point. 

I have thus disposed of all the valid arguments brought forward by Mr. 



OF WASHINGTON. 153 

Hulst to sustain his position on this matter. I may briefly notice, how 
ever, a little satire which he indulges in at my expense, and a quite irrele 
vant assertion which happens also to be incorrect. 

As one deeply interested in apiculture and a practical bee-keeper twenty- 
seven years ago, it was, perhaps, unpardonable in me not to qualify the 
statement about bees not being attracted to white flowers. Both Miiller, 
in his " Alpenblumen," and Lubbock, in "Ants, Bees, Wasps," etc., have 
shown that bees prefer blue and purple to white flowers, and this is what 
was meant on the face of my language, so to cpeak; but Mr. Hulst has 
naturally made the most of the lapsus, and scored a point where every 
other point is against him. 

The assertion which I would call atfention to, and which is entirely be 
side the question at issue, is that ''we are indebted to Dr. Engelmann for 
the discovery of the fact that Pronuba is an agent in the fertilization of 
Yucca." 

Whatever may have led Mr. Hulst to make this assertion, it is simply 
untrue, and the facts, which I may as well put on record here, are these : 
In June, 1872, Dr. Engelmann, who then knew full well that Yucca needed 
extraneous aid in fertilization, called my attention to this fact, and to the 
further fact that insects, especially white moths and soldier-beetles CC/iau- 
liognathus), were common in the flowers. He made no observations what 
ever upon insect pollination, but wished me to study the question. The 
discovery that Pronuba was the agent was my own, as were all the subse 
quent discoveries in reference to the insect made that year; but they were 
always communicated to him, and often shared with and witnessed by him. 
My first paper on the subject was read in August, 1872, before the A. A. A. S., 
at its Dubuque (Iowa) meeting, and presented to the Academy of Sciences 
of St. Louis at the meeting for September 2, 1872. Dr. Engelmann's " Notes 
on the genus Yucca " were presented to the same Academy September 16, 
1872. Both papers are printed in vol. iiiof the Transactions of the Academy, 
Dr. Engelmann's preceding, because leading up to mine. In his paper 
Dr. E. says : <l The suspected insects were handed over to my friend Mr. 
C. V. Riley, who thereupon took up the zoological part of the investiga 
tion, the surprisingly interesting results of which are detailed by him in the 
succeeding paper" (Trans., etc., iii, p. 19), and I distinctly express my in 
debtedness to him " for drawing my attention to the fact that the plants of 
this genus must rely on some insect or other for fertilization." It is quite 
probable that but for Dr. Engelmann's suggestion I should never have 
made the investigations, and he should share with me whatever honor at 
taches to the discovery. If this is what Mr. Hulst means his language is 
unfortunate. Dr. Engelmann was, during my residence in St. Louis, at once 
my friend, companion, and master in natural history matters, and I have 
too much reverence for his memory to allow to pass unchallenged what he 
himself would repudiate were he still among us. As soon as I had learned 
that Pronuba was the agent he sent a brief announcement to the Bulletin of 
the Torrey Botanical Club (vol. iii, No. 7, July, 1872, p. 33) rather hastily 



154 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

referring to the insect as " a white moth of the genus Tortrix," and in a 
subsequent communication (ibid., August, 1872, p. 37) he corrected the 
error and recorded some further facts in the life-history of the insect. In 
neither case was there any claim of individual discovery of the entomo 
logical facts, and these announcements must be read in the light of his 
subsequent more deliberate language which I have quoted. 

In conclusion, having already devoted more time to Mr. Hulst's opinions 
than they justify, let me add that another year's study of Yucca fertilization 
has not only served to confirm all that I have hitherto written, but still 
further to enhance the importance of Pronuba to the plant and the intelli 
gent nature of her unique performances. Prof. Wm. Trelease, who has 
made the only other careful observations on the subject which have come to 
my notice, has demonstrated (Bull. Torrey Bot. Club, Aug., 1886, pp. 135- 
141) that the stigmatic liquor is not nectariferous, but that the slight 
amount of nectar associated with the flowers is secreted in thin pockets 
formed by the partitions that separate the three cells of the pistil, and 
which open externally by a contracted pore from which the nectar is poured 
through a capillary tube (enclosed by the closely applied, but not out 
wardly united, lobes of the ovary) to the base of the pistil, so that nectar- 
feeding insects seek it not about the stigma, but at the base of the pistil 
or of the petals, whether within or without. I have fully verified Tre- 
lease's statements by dissection and study of the insects seeking this scant 
nectar, and endorse his conclusion that while the observations serve to 
disprove any positive value of their nectar in the pollination of Yucca 
flowers, they add to the importance of Pronuba by showing that the acts 
of collecting the pollen and transferring it to the stigma are performed 
voluntarily and without food compensation as I was at first inclined to 
believe. 

I have lately had the pleasure of studying Yucca -whipplei in California 
and the remarkable tree-yucca ( Y. brevifolia] in the Mojave desert. The 
former is pollinized by Pronuba maculata Riley, and the latter by a most 
remarkably modified and adapted species which I expect to describe as 
Pronuba paradoxa. 

Thus everywhere in the United States where Yucca nominally fruits we 
find it associated with its Pronuba. 

I await with interest and curiosity any new discoveries in this connec 
tion, but, so far as present knowledge justifies anticipation, I should ex 
pect, where neither Pronuba nor Pronuba-like insect exists, to find the plant 
modified to more readily permit self-fertilization sooner than to find Apis 
mellifica the pollinizing agent, the opinion of Mr. E. L. Layard, of 
New Caledonia (who first expressed it in 1880; Nature, vol. xxii, p. 606), 
and of Mr. Hulst, to the contrary notwithstanding.

Mr. Schwarz said, commenting on Miiller's statement that bees 
do not visit white flowers, that Miiller was not speaking of food 
flowers at the time, but what he calls bee flowers. 

Mr. Howard thought that Prof. Riley's experiments, confining 
bees with Yucca which they did not touch, were conclusive. 

Mr. Smith said that the habits of an insect in one locality are 
not necessarily the same as in another. Both Mr. Hulst and Prof. 
Cook had seen bees on Yucca. On Long Island he had found 
Lachnosterna in great abundance on blackberry blossoms. Mr. 
Townsend had found them in Michigan with similar habits. He 
had this season failed to find a single specimen on the flowers 
near Washington, though there were plenty of beetles all around. 

Prof. Riley reasserted the similar fact regarding bees, which 
were often very capricious, but showed that, where they do visit 
the Yucca flowers, they have nothing to do with fertilizing them, 
and, even in artificial pollination by man, perfect fruit can only 
be obtained when the pollination is done as fully and carefully as 
it is done by Pronuba.

Two BRILLIANT AND INTERESTING MICRO-LEPIDOPTERA NEW TO OUR 

FAUNA. 

BY C. V RILEY. 

I have had for some time, as a part of the material which I have turned 
over to the National Museum, two small moths of exceptional brilliancy 
and beauty, which are new to our fauna and which I took occasion to study 
while in Europe last autumn. As a rule, I do not care to present isolated 
descriptions of species, but in both these instances there are special rea 
sons for departing from this rule, as the first is one of the largest and pret 
tiest of the Tineina, having a superficial Tortricid habitus, and the second 
is interesting as belonging to a small group essentially exotic, which has 
been placed by authors both in the Tineidse and the Tortricidse, and which 
virtually is a somewhat interesting form belonging rather to the lower 
Noctuidae. I name them in honor of two of our most capable and most 
worthy micro-lepidopterists, and in each case with permission.

approaching in some instances to olivaceous ; face and palpi paler, more 
yellowish. Thorax of the same vivid green, somewhat more yellowish on 
the borders, but especially on the collar, which is separated from the meso- 
thorax by a fine black suture. Primaries of the same vivid green at basal 
third, posteriorly limited by a straight line which slightly obliques outwardly 



156 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

toward the inner border; along the costa is a dark, somewhat lunate dash 
or streak, reaching the base of the wing, but not the posterior limit of the 
green space ; on the inner base there is also more or less black ; along the 
margins of the black the green becomes more yellowish, and in some in 
stances is bright sulphur-yellow; beyond this basal green space the orna 
mentation is difficult to describe, consisting of dark metallic hues, chang 
ing from bronze to violet in varying lights. A perfect unspread specimen, 
screened from side lights, appears bright metallic bronze, with a purplish 
.gloss interrupted by two sinuate transverse bands of a darker shade of 
brown, almost black : the first of these consists of two patches or tufts 
of raised scales, truncate posteriorly ; the second band is sinuate, the scales 
are less raised, and form no distinct tufts : a dusky spot at apex, and another 
at anal angle ; between the dark bands there is an almost white costal spot, 
shading imperceptibly into the bronze of the rest of the space. In a re 
flected light the ordinary appearance of the wings shows, between these 
dark bands and the dark posterior border, three distinct coincident bands of 
the most brilliant metallic gold and lilac ; the first corresponding to the pos 
terior limit of the green ; the second more irregular, and across the second 
third of wing; and the third elbowing near apex and coincident with hind 
border. In most specimens, along the median of these metallic bands, the 
wing is more or less whitish, particularly at costa, while there is also more 
or less white on the costa just inside the third or posterior metallic band. 
Secondaries bronzy-black, with less lustre than the primaries, and with 
distinct whitish fringe. Beneath both wings are brownish-black, glisten 
ing, the primaries with an indefinite and incomplete whitish line along 
posterior border, and two paler costal spots, corresponding to those on up 
per surface, more or less fully indicated ; the secondaries with tips of fringes 
only, whitish. Legs bronzy-black, the front coxae white or yellowish ; front 
tarsi ringed with white; spurs of middle tibiae white, with a few dusky 
scales, and middle tarsi ringed with white; posterior tibiae with white 
annulus and white tip, and with the spurs white, with two white annuli. 
Abdomen bronzy-black, with metallic iridescence; the ovipositor of the 
female pale, lance-shaped, and usually extruded beyond the tip ; the basal 
segment above with the margins usually flaked with white, and tending 
to form a distinct white annulus. 

Described from 12 specimens. 

Hab., Los Angeles Co., Cal. 

Differs at once from 5 1 . xanthobasis Zeller by the fine green color of the 
basal space, the maculation of the remainder of the wing being lighter and 
more distinct throughout. 

From chlorobasis Zeller it differs in the costal maculation of the green 
basal space, as well as in the whitish costal spots, which seem to be entirely 
wanting in the Brazilian species. From both the prominent raised scales 
will serve as a distinguishing feature. 

I first met with this interesting little species upon my trip to Los Angeles 
in the spring of 1887, Mr. Coquillett having obtained a number of speci-

mens, and Mr. Koebele having reared it from larvae feeding between the 
leaves of Quercus agrifolia. 

This genus was described by Zeller in 1875 (Verh. z. b. Ges., Wien., vol. 
xxv, p. 324), and referred to the Cfioreutinte as a close ally of Simcet&is, but 
only two species were described, those with which I have compared it. 
His generic characterization is imperfect from lack of material, but I will 
give a more full characterization at some future time.

WALSINGHAMIA, Gen. nov.ffead distinct, somewhat protuberant be 
tween the eyes, but not tuberculate or mucronate; ocelli distinct, large; 
palpi slender, reaching to about the middle of front ; terminal joint scarcely 
more than half as long as second, slender, with a pointed tip; no maxil 
lary palpi; tongue moderate; antennae for about half their length thickly 
clothed with scales above; beyond this the joints are well marked, and 
mobility seems practically confined to this part of the antenna; a broad 
white ring just above the thickened part, otherwise black, basally marked 
with ferruginous scales above. Thorax smooth and well rounded at shoul 
ders ; legs stout, rather short, densely clothed with scales, the tarsi most 
distinctly so, the segmentation so obscured that they seem four-jointed; 
tarsal claws very minute and simple; median tibia two-spurred, posterior 
with both median and terminal spurs of good length, the former rather 
more, the latter less, than one-third the length of the tibia. Wings rather 
large ; primaries with costa distinctly arched toward apex, which is some 
what acute; posterior border oblique to the obtusely rounded anal angle; 
i2-veined; dorsal vein furcate basally; costal vein (12) strong, from base 
to costa beyond the middle; n from subcostal about one-third from base 
to costa; subcostal from base to end of cell, and continued thence unbroken 
to costa rather within half its entire length it forms a slight angle, giving 
rise to a faint vein running to the cross-vein and forming a large accessory 
cell; cross vein distinct between veins 9 and 10 (which are widely sepa 
rated); 9 to costa near apex, forming a series of faint curves between 
veins 4 and 9; 5 to 8, inclusive, decidedly weaker than the other veins; 8 
from cross-vein to apex, equidistant between 7 and 9, which are not farther 
apart at base than 5 and 6; 7 continuing from the faint vein closing the 
accessory cell to the hind margin below apex; 5 from cross-vein, nearly 
midway between 4 and 6 nearer the former to the hind margin ; 3 and 
4 from the end of the median, and rather close together ; 2 from the median, 
about f from base, to outer margin ; i (dorsal vein) from base to anal 
angle. Secondaries with veins 5 to 7, as well as the subcostal, much 
weaker than the others ; costal vein free from base to costa near apex ; 
three dorsal veins, the intermediate (i b] distinctly furcate basally ; median 
giving off 2 close to the end of the cell and continuing beyond, giving off 
3 and 4 on a stalk, half way to the hind margin ; 5 from the cross-vein 
about midway between 4 and 6; 6 from the cross-vein nearer to 7 than 5; 
7 continuing the subcostal from the end of cell to the apex; a faint longi 
tudinal vein divides the cell and terminates on the cross-vein between 5

and 6. Abdomen with no unusual character. No secondary sexual dif 
ferences of importance, the antennae only being somewhat more thickly 
clothed in the male. 

Named after Thomas, Lord Walsingham. 

This genus finds its nearest ally in Choregia Zeller (Felder) ; referred 
to the Tineidae by Felder. The venation and other structure seem to 
agree more nearly with the Tortricidae, both in this genus and in Choregia, 
the vein i b of secondaries being furcate at base, though the forks are in 
distinct, the vein becoming well marked only below the forks. The 
weakness of the sub-costal and its derivatives is very well marked in both 
genera, and there is a very faint branch between the subcostal and costal 
near the base. 

The habitus of this genus would place it nearer to Mictopsychia, but that 
genus has but two internal veins to secondaries, while the distribution of 
the veins of primaries indicates a location much higher in the scale, and is 
hardly Tortricid. 

Choregia has similar antennae, but in the male they are ciliated beneath ; 
the front is not produced or conic, but is flat, and the head therefore shorter ; 
the palpi are longer, much stouter, not curved upward ; the legs are longer 
and more slender, the tarsal joints distinctly marked ; the primaries are 
narrower, subequal, and longer, the posterior border less oblique. The 
venation, while of the same type, presents several differences of generic 
importance : veins 7 to 10 are from the rounded apex of the cell, 10 not as 
the continuation of the subcostal, and much nearer to 9 than in the new 
genus. There is no accessory cell, and veins 3-5 are equidistant instead 
of 5 almost equidistant between 4 and 6. 

Walsinghamia belongs to a distinctively South American type, and will 
probably be associated, having similar antennae, with Gauris Walker and 
Rhobonda Walker the species being principally from Brazil. 

WALSINGHAMIA DIVA n. sp. Expanse 16 mm. General colors, brilliant 
metallic blue and purple, an4 non-metallic orange-red. Head, bright rusty- 
red above ; front yellow; palpi pale yellow, tipped with blackish. Thorax 
a leaden, somewhat metallic blackish-gray, with yellow scales at sides of 
scutellum. Primaries metallic purple at basal third, to a distinct transverse 
golden-yellow band which obliques posteriorly but very little, and is nar 
rowly margined each side by a row of black scales : beyond this the purple 
assumes deeper violet and steel-blue hues through the middle portion of 
the wing, giving way to a metallic, deep greenish gloss, which extends 
to a strongly curved cream-yellow streak, which starts broadly and 
obliquely from the costa at f from base, is suddenly narrowed and poste 
riorly bent on the cell, then runs nearly to the apex, where it again curves 
almost at right angles and runs parallel to the posterior margin, rapidly 
narrowing, and lost about \ from anal angle : beyond this yellow streak a 
deep rust-red band runs as a margin around the apex and along hind bor 
der to anal angle ; between the two streaks the deep violet-purple scales 
form a narrow band, widest along costa : fringes leaden-black, with a black

line at base. Secondaries deep orange-red, with a blackish submarginal 
cloud near apex; fringes as on primaries : beneath, secondaries as above; 
primaries leaden-gray, with marginal reddish streak reproduced, but in 
paler shade ; the yellow streak of upper side also indicated on costa in the 
same color, and a central, longitudinal reddish cloud. Legs with the femora 
and'tibise pale beneath, dark above, the hind tibiae with golden-yellow 
scales above, and with a dark terminal annulus; tarsi inclining to golden- 
yellow, with one dark annulus about basal third, and tips also dark. Abdo 
men of the same leaden black, banded with rather a dull gamboge or golden 
yellow; anal tuftings more distinctly marked with this last color. 

Described from 3 specimens collected by Mr. E. A. Schwarz at Cocoa- 
nut Grove, Fla., in May, 1887. The larva skeletonizes the leaves of a wild 
species of Ficus, presumably F. fiedunculata, and makes an even, fine web. 

Prof. Riley read a short note calling attention to an error in the 
published Minutes of the Am. Philos. Soc. regarding the date of 
the first appearance of the "Hessian Fly." He found on hunting 
up the Minutes that the term " Hessian Fly" does not occur in 
them at all until 1791, long after the Revolution; that the pas 
sages relied on by Dr. Hagen to prove its presence in America 
before the Hessians arrived mention the u Fly in Wheat," " the 
Fly," or u the Fly-weavil," which refer to Sitophilus oryzce S. 
granarius* or Gelechia cereallela. Dr. Hagen's argument based 
on the erroneous quotations therefore fails.* 

Messrs. Howard, Schwarz, and Smith made some remarks on 
this subject. 

Mr. Howard read a description of an interesting new parasite

pursuing like a hawk a specimen of Ammophila. 

Prof. Riley described the methods of attack of Tachinids on 
locusts, and the .efforts of the locusts to get away.

TERMITOPHILOUS COLEOPTERA FOUND IN NORTH AMERICA. 

BY E. A. SCHWARZ. 

Dr. Horn has quite recently (Trans Amer. Ent Soc., vol. xv, 1888) de 
scribed and figured the very interesting larva of Glyptns, a genus of Cara- 
bid(E, which occurs in tropical Africa in the nests of white ants, and this 
reminded me that I had long since promised to put on record a list of such 
of our North American Coleoptera as are known to live exclusively among 
termites. The paleotropical region seems to abound in such Coleoptera ; 
in South America some extraordinary forms have been discovered among 
termites, and two of these genera, Corotoca and Spirachtha, have been 
described and figured by the late Prof. Schioedte. In North America only 
a few termitophilous species have hitherto been observed, but I feel quite 
confident that future investigations, especially in the southwestern portion 
of the country, will greatly swell their number. Our field coleopterists 
pay too little attention to the subject, and then it must be remembered that 
termitophilous Coleoptera, with the only exception of the genus Philo- 
termes, are much more difficult to find than myrmecophilous species. As 
is the case with this latter class of Coleoptera, we are quite ignorant re 
garding the earlier stages of termitophilous species, nor do we know any 
thing of their relations to their hosts. 

The list of species, so far as I am able to make it out from the few ob 
servations on record and from the experience of my friends and myself, 
is as follows : 

1. Myrmecochara pictipennis. According to Dr. G. Kraatz (Linnoea 
Entomologica, vol. ii, p. 41) this has been found by Prof. Schaum in the 
nests of termites in Louisiana. I found this little-known species at vari 
ous points in the Southern States, but always among ants {Solenopsis 
geminata), and a second undescribed species, in all probability referable 
to the same genus, occurs near Washington, D. C. , also among ants 
{Pheidole debilis). Thus I catalogue this species with some doubt among 
the termitophilous Coleoptera. 

2. Philotermes pilosus, found in Mass., Pa., D. C. and Tenn. 

3. Ph. pennsylvanicus, found in Mass., Pa., D. C. and Florida (Crescent 
City). 

4. Ph. Fuchsii, found in Tenn. and Fla. (Crescent City). 

5. Microcyptus testaceus, found in Ga. (AthensJ and Fla. (New Smyrna 
and Crescent City). 

6. Trichopsenius depressus, found in Texas (Columbus), La., and Fla. 
(Crescent City). I was quite surprised to learn from Mr. Fred. Blanchard 
that he found it also near Lowell, Mass. 

7. Xenistusa cavernosa.

8 . Xe n istusa fossa ta . 

9. prcssa. 

The three last-named species have hitherto been found onlj at Columbus, 
Tex. They occurred in a prostrate, but not decayed, trunk of Celtis texana, 
which was honeycombed by a large colony of Termes. Specimens were 
quite abundant in the galleries of the white ants, but since the wood was 
very hard they had to be cut out with an axe and on account of this awk 
ward mode of investigation only a few could be secured. When alive, and 
when examined shortly after being killed, they seemed to represent three 
species; they were sent so to Dr. Leconte and accordingly described by 
him as three different species. However, from the descriptions and the 
dried specimens in our collections, it is difficult to distinguish the species, 
and quite impossible to conceive a correct idea of the peculiar appearance 
of these insects when alive. With their cylindrical body, their greatly ex 
tended abdomen, and their peculiar mode of locomotion, they resemble 
much more the wingless white ants than we would suspect from the dried 
specimens. They are by far the most remarkable termitophilous Coleop- 
tera hitherto discovered in North America. If they should be found again 
they ought to be put in weak alcohol so as to preserve their original shape 
and to enable a more careful description of their structural characters, and 
more especially the secondary sexual characters on the last ventral segment. 

Next to this genus in resemblance to their hosts are the species of Philo- 
tcrmcs. This is the only genus which, in my experience, wanders about 
with the White ants in their subterraneous foraging expeditions, and 
which may be found among them in early spring under stones, old bark, 
etc. But the specimens are more abundant in the nests of the white ants, 
and the other genera are only found within the true nests of their hosts, 
or very rarely in their immediate vicinity. The genera Myrmecochara, 
Microcyptus, and Trichopsenius have little or no resemblance to Termes, 
but they all have that peculiar appearance at once suggestive of an inquili- 
nous or parasitic mode of life such as we are accustomed to see in most 
myrmecophilous and parasitic Coleoptera. The general similarity in ap 
pearance and superficial structural characters between Microcyptus and 
Limulodes, a myrmecophilous genus of the family Trichopterygid.cz, have 
already been pointed out by Dr. Horn (Trans. Am. Ent. Soc., vi, 1877, p. 
87), and no one can deny a certain superficial resemblance, though not in 
any structural details, between Trichopsenius and the beaver parasite, 
Platvpsyllus castoris. 

All species in the above list we're found among Termes flavipes, and it 
will be noticed that, except in the Southern States, they have hitherto been 
observed only east of the Alleghanies. 

Specimens of the species mentioned were shown by Mr. 
Schwarz. 

Some discussion on the place of these insects in the economy 
of Termes took place between Mr. Schwarz and Prof. Riley.

Mr. Howard remarked that no Hymenopterous parasites of 
Termes Were known, unless Caratomus should prove such. 

Mr. Schwarz said he had seen Carato?nus only on the walls of 
the Department of Agriculture where there are Termes.

NOTES ON COLEOPTERA OF PfiEKSKILL, N. Y. , FOR 1887. 
BY JOHN D. SHERMAN, JK. 

Helops cereus and micans, the former in the greater numbers, occur to 
gether under stones at the bases of trees. 

Haltica ignita is common on the leaves of Kalmia early in May. 
Prionochteta opaca is common both in carrion and fungi. 

I found some sixty or seventy specimens of Pityophthorus querciperda 
under bark of a felled oak tree. 

Xantholinus fulgidus was found among rubbish, such as dried sticks, 
ashes of a bonfire, old leaves and soil, late in April and early in May; 
about 35 specimens. 

Throughout April Oxytelus rugosus is very common under small stones 
in the garden, some 30 having been found under each stone. The beetle 
also flies about on warm afternoons. 

Oxyomus porcatus and Rhyssemus scaber also fly around heaps of rub 
bish oil warm afternoons in the early part of May. 

A pair of Hister planipes was found in an ants' nest under a stone on 
April 21. 

Coptocycla aurichalcea frequents the flowers of Ranunculus, with which 
it closely assimilates in color. 

Prasocuris varipes is also found on Ranunculus in the latter part of May. 

Valgus canaliculatus flies on warm days in May, and is also found in the 
dirt under bark of old stumps. 

On May 7, a chilly, showery day, nearly 160 specimens of Megilla macu- 
lata were found huddled together under one stone. 

Aphodius fossor was quite common in May and June. 

Diabrotica vittata, D. i2-punctata, and Bolboceras; lazarus, one speci 
men each, and several specimens of Aphodius stercorosus were attracted 
by a light at night July 15. 

Paeudebceits oblitus was common in the latter part of May amongst the 
lichens on rocks. 

Otiorhynclncs ovatus was common in July, as usual, on fences, old wood, 
around houses, etc. 



OF WASHINGTON. 163 

Disonycha limbicollt's, 30 specimens, Limonius auripilis, 8 specimens, 
and Ltxus concavus, 8 specimens, were found on June 8 and 13 on a species 
of Rumex. 

Batyle suturalis and Centrinus scutellum-album are common on Ox-eye 
Daisy (Leticanthemum vulgare} ; the latter species and Rhipiphorus dimi- 
diatus and cruentatus occur on Nepeta cataria. 

The flowers of Viburnum prunifolium yield Molorchus, Sericosoimis, 
Agriotes, Attains scincetus, Anaspisflavipennis, and species of many other 
genera. 

Mr. Smith, referring to the note on Helops* said that he had 
never found them except under the bark of trees. Valgus he has 
found very local on Long Island ; a single patch of woods only 
yielding any number of specimens. He described their location 
in the stumps of trees, and the season at which they were found. 

Mr. Schwarz said that his experience agreed with that of Mr. 
Sherman regarding Helops ; he has found them under stones near 
the base of trees. He added that it is strange that no one has 
succeeded in finding the larva of Helops in our country, common 
as it must be.

NOTES ON THE FOOD HABITS OF SOME NORTH AMERICAN SCOLYTID^E 

AND THEIR COLEOPTEROUS ENEMIES. 

BY E. A. SCHWAKZ. 

Pityophthorus concentralis Eichhoff, originally described from Cuba, 
must be added to our fauna, since it occurs abundantly throughout the 
semi-tropical region of Florida on the Poison wood {Rkus metopium.~) It 
is closely allied to P. consimilis, but at once distinguished by the sharply 
raised concentric lines on the anterior part of the thorax. Its work may be 
briefly described as follows : By the co-operation of several parent beetles 
a large central chamber of irregular outline is excavated under the thin 
bark of the trunk or larger branches of the tree. Several (from two to five), 
more or less, undulating primary galleries, of not great length, radiate 
from this chamber, and the eggs are deposited singly in little indentations 
either on one side or on both sides of these galleries during the process 
of excavation. The larval galleries are short, either diverging in the usual 
way or frequently intersecting each other, or even reverting to the central 
chamber. The pupal chamber is not sunk into the wood. 

In the middle of June, 1887, I found on Mr. Hubbard's Prairie Farm, near 
Hawk Creek, Volusia Co., Fla., a prostrate tree of Black Gum (Liquid- 
ambar styraciflua}, which had been felled in October the previous year. 
Upon beating the branches into my umbrella I found numerous specimens 
of two Scolytids, Pityophthorus ptilicarius and another species of the same 



164 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

genus, which, upon subsequent comparison, I fail to distinguish from P. 
annectens* The former of these is an easily recognized species known to 
infest Pine trees, and its occurrence on Liquidambar could not fail to at 
tract my attention. Wishing to ascertain the life-history of this, as well as 
of P. annectens, I carried some infested branches with me to Washington 
for further investigation. I did not breed a single specimen of P. puli- 
carius, nor did I find any trace of its galleries under the bark, and feel con 
fident, therefore, that this species does not breed on Liquidambar, and that 
the specimens only visited the tree for feeding purposes. Of P. annectens 
I obtained, in the course of the subsequent month, several hundred speci 
mens from the branches. Its work closely resembles that of P. concen- 
tralis, but the primary and larval galleries are longer, owing, no doubt, to 
the softer nature of the wood. 

In July of the present year an immense colony of Pityophthorus consi- 
milis was found near Washington, D. C., infesting the dead and dying 
branches of a large specimen of Rhus toxicodcndron, which had been torn 
down by a storm in August, 1887. That this species infests Rhus glabra 
has been pointed out by me on a previous occasion (see p. 17), but I had 
not before known it to live in the Poison Ivy. Its primary galleries also 
start from a central chamber, but usually follow, more or less, the longi 
tudinal axis of the vine, rarely going around the twig. The species is evi 
dently very prolific, and the larval galleries crowd and intersect each other 
so often that the whole bark in the vicinity of the central chamber is com 
pletely undermined, and the individual larval galleries cannot longer be 
distinguished When full-grown the larvae enter a little more the solid 
wood to undergo their transformation. Pieces of infested vines were, for 
several months, under my observation, and thousands of beetles emerged, 
and some are still emerging up to the present day. 

Although I had twigs of Liquidambar and vines of Poison Ivy infested 
with Pityophthorus for several months in my room I never obtained a 
single hymenopterous parasite therefrom, but I had occasion to observe 
some coleopterous enemies of these Scolytids. Lczmophlceus (Dysmerus} 
basalts occurred occasionally in the galleries of/ 3 , concentralis in southern 
Florida. I obtained it also in some numbers from Liquidambar twigs in 
fested by P. annectens, and in great numbers from the vines of Rhus toxi- 



*The species was described by Dr. LeConte from specimens found by 
me many years ago at Tampa, Fla. , on the Yellow Pine {Pinus palustris). 
The specimens were only beaten from the trees, which does not indicate 
that they breed under pine bark. From what we know at present of the 
life-history of our Pityophthorus, it seems hardly probable that the same 
species infests Conifers and, at the same time, deciduous trees. It is pos 
sible that we have to do here with two different species. From a letter 
by Dr. LeConte, published in Bull. No. 7 of the U. S. Entom. Comm., pp. 
260-261, it appears that Dr. Packard also obtained P. annectens from a de 
ciduous tree, but, unfortunately, the name of the tree is not mentioned.

codendron infested by P. consimilis. Here I succeeded also in finding its 
larva within the galleries of the Scolytid. From the Liquidambar twigs 
I obtained further a small number of the rare Narthecius grandicefis, and 
from the vines of Rhus toxicodendron a few specimens of Lcemophloeus an- 
gustulus, which species was also bred some years since by Mr. H. G. Hub- 
bard from twigs of Rhus glabra infested by P. consimilis. The three 
Cucuj ids just mentioned have a rather cylindrical form of body, and I am 
inclined to believe that their larvae will only be found within the galleries 
of bark-boring Scolytids, whereas most of the species of Lcemophlocus 
with flattened body, e. g., L. testaceus, biguttatus, etc., are. not enemies of 
Scolytids, but probably prey upon dipterous and other coleopterous larvse 
living under loosened bark. A single specimen of Scalidia Uncarts, found 
dead in the galleries of P. conccntralis in southeastern Florida, might in 
dicate that the larva of this species is preying on those of Scolytid. The 
larva of Nemosoma cylindricum was frequently found in the galleries of 
P. consimilis, and is a very efficient enemy of this, and no doubt also of 
other Scolytids infesting deciduous trees. No Histeridcevitrt found in the 
galleries of the three Pityophthorus mentioned above, though our species of 
Cylistix, and the more cylindrical species of Platysoma and their larvae, 
are common enough in the galleries of pine-infesting Scolytids. Our 
species of Hypop/ilceus seem also to prey only on Scolytids infesting 
Conifers. Some genera of Cleridce, both in the imago and larval states, 
are well known as enemies of Scolytidae ; the pretty Clerus ichneumoneus 
could frequently be seen on the trunks of Rhus met opium watching for the 
Pityophthorus and snapping them off as soon as they emerged from their 
holes, and a large Clerid larva found in the galleries probably belongs to 
that species. From the twigs infested by P. annectens and consimilis I 
bred numerous specimens of Phyllobtenus dislocatus, but did not observe 
the larva. 

An accidental, but nevertheless very efficient, enemy of P. annec 
tens proved to be a Cerambycid larva, viz., that of Leptostylus acu- 
It/er, which was quite common in the Liquidambar branches. The bur 
rows of this Leptostylus are very broad when compared with the diameter 
of the larva, and are preferably constructed right through the colonies of 
the Scolytids, completely obliterating their galleries and crushing the 
Scolytid larvae and pupae. I have since observed that the larvae of allied 
Cerambycids (Leptostyhis macula and Hyperplatys arfersus), which I found 
in Hickory twigs inhabited by Thysanoes fimbricornis, have also the habit 
of running their galleries over those of the Scolytid, for the reason, I sup 
pose, that on such places the bark has become somewhat loosened from 
the wood, thus facilitating the burrowing on the part of the Cerambycid 
larva.

ON A NEW AND INTERESTING SPIDER FROM THE UNITED STATES. 

BY GEORGE MARX, M. D. 

Allow me to draw your attention to a new and very remarkable spider 
from the United States, which is so singular and strange in its structural 
characters that nothing like it has been hitherto known toarachnologists ; 
so peculiar that it cannot be placed in our present system ; so anom 
alous that it appears like the representative of a prototype, in which 
characters were united in one individual which are now distributed into 
widely differing genera. 

It was found by my friend Dr. Fox, of this city, in the neighborhood of 
Lookout Mountain, Tenn., where it lives in the forests of that mountain 
ous region. It constructs at the underside of projecting cliffs or rocks a 
white, dense web that resembles a saucer or the shade of a student's lamp, 
the narrow part being attached to the surface of the stone, the broader 
and lower margin hanging face downward, being held in place by some 
stronger guy threads and a loose reticulum which surrounds the whole 
structure. In this the spider dwells in an inverted position, and it shakes 
the web like some other species (especially Pholcus) when one ap 
proaches it. 

When I received this spider it appeared at the first glance, by its gen 
eral aspect, the long, slender legs, the shape of the body, the pale color, 



OF WASHINGTON. 167 

as a member of the family Pholcidae, but a closer examination soon re 
vealed its true, wonderful characters and the great importance of its dis 
covery. 
The principal and most important characters are as follows : 

1. It has four true lung sacs or lamellar tracheae. 

2. It has a cribellum and calamistrum. 

3. The mandibular claws are inserted nearly vertically. 

4. The maxillae stand upon the broad and short labium (instead of the 
labium being placed between the two maxillae, as is the common case;. 

5. It has the general appearance of a Pholcus. 

The four lungs present would place it into the Tribe Territelarice but 
for the calamistrum and cribellum, which organs no member of that 
group hitherto known possesses, and for the fact that this spider constructs 
a web above the ground. Besides these points, the whole aspect of our 
animal speaks against its being placed in that Tribe, for it resembles 
and shows evident affinity to certain families of the Tribe Tubitelariae 
and Retilelarise, and it would find a more natural place amongst these 
groups were it not for the number of lung-sacs, which excludes it at once 
from them. 

I sent some specimens to Prof. T. Thorell in Italy, acknowledged to be 
one of our best Arachnologists, and he was equally surprised at it. 
"This wonderful spider is the most curious one discovered in this cen 
tury," he wrote. 

At his suggestion I named it Hypochilus (from the position of the max 
illae above the Hp), and in appreciation of this distinguished naturalist 
and my friend, Hypochilus Thorellii, and the new family which it con 
stitutes, Hypochilidce.* 

This paper was discussed by Messrs. Schwarz, Smith, Mann, 
and Drs. Marx and Fox. In the course of this discussion Dr. 
Fox described more in detail the web-rhaking habits of the species, 
and Dr. Marx gave a review of the different families of spiders 
and their mode of web-making.

TWELVE SPECIES OF COLEOPTERA TAKEN FROM STOMACHS OF TOADS IN 
MICHIGAN, WITH REMARKS ON THE FOOD-HABITS OF TOADS. 

BY TYLER TOWNSEND. 

At the time that Professor S. A. Forbes made known his observations 
relative to the food-habits of birds, it occurred to me, as it doubtless also 
did to others, that toads, and, indeed, all animals with an appetite for in 
sects in a general way, where no particular discrimination is shown, were 
likewise injurious by destroying beneficial insects, which if left to live

would make away with many more noxious individuals than the toads 
themselves consumed. 

On the 7th of August, 1883, while examining the stomach of a toad 
caught in some woods near Constantine, T found therein an ichneumon fly 
and a single lepidopterous larva. The former was either Ophion or a nearly 
allied genus. Here was a decidedly injurious toad to begin with, as one 
ichneumon fly of this genus will parasitize quite a number of caterpillars, 
and in the case of some genera of parasitic hymenoptera the numerous 
progeny that follow would in turn parasitize an immensely larger number. 
I have also seen a record of one Calosoma frigidum, parts of Cicindela 
repanda, and several Platynus placidus being found in the stomach of a 
single very harmful toad. Many rarities are encountered in this way by 
enthusiastic collectors. 

The dozen species of Coleoptera which I give here were taken from the 
stomachs of toads caught in the vicinity of Constantine, Michigan. In all 
of the cases but three I make a record in connection with each species of 
the nature of the locality in which the toad was found, also the time of 
day and the state of the weather, as these items would naturally have some 
bearing on the subject. Not more than a half dozen toads were consulted 
to gain the material herewith presented, which, although fragmentary, I 
have thought it well to record. The_y all belonged to the common species, 
Btifo americanus. 

The twelve species of Coleoptera are : 

Pterostichns stygicus. Several taken from one toad found in woods under 
one of the species of fungi commonly known as " toad-stools," where it

' Mr. Smith said that he had examined the stomachs of many,

frogs, but never of toads. He had, however, observed them, and 
they are, in his opinion, decidedly more beneficial than other 
wise. Mr. Schwarz said toads eat May-beetles, one toad exam 
ined having no less than eight Lachnosternas in its stomach. In 
the wilder parts of the Lake Superior region the best method of 
finding rare species is in the stomachs of toads. He had reason 
to believe that some of the harder weevils pass through the toads 
without being in any way injured thereby. 
Mr. Schwarz then read the following note : 

ON A COLLECTION OF COLEOPTERA FROM ST. AUGUSTINE, FLORIDA. 

BY E. A. SCHWARZ. 

Through the kindness of Dr. John Hamilton, of Pittsburg, Pa., I re 
ceived lately a list of nearly six hundred species of Coleoptera, collected 
by the Rev. Charles Johnston in the vicinity of St. Augustine, Fla. The 
species have been named -by Dr. Hamilton, and since he is known as a 
careful and experienced Coleopterist the determinations are no doubt re 
liable. 

As I never collected in northern Florida, and since our knowledge of 
the Coleoptera of that part of the State is still very defective, the list Js an 
important contribution to the knowledge of the fauna of Florida, and this 
the more so because an exact locality is given, whereas, in most other 
species coming from other sources, but presumably collected in northern 
Florida, no precise locality is given, the species being simply labeled or 
recorded from " Florida." Moreover, this list comprises such a large num 
ber of species being defective only in the smaller and less conspicuous 
forms that the character of the fauna of that locality may be fairly recog 
nized therefrom. Finally, the collection is of special interest to me be 
cause it comes from a part of the coast not so verv far remote from the 
line which, at a former occasion, I have designated as the northern limit 
of the semi-tropical fauna, and this collection is, therefore, able to prove 
ordisp rove the correctness of my statement. In scanning the list I find 
only five species which belong to the West Indian colony in Florida, viz., 
Leptostylus terrcecolor, Ischnocerus infuscatus, Arti^us ftoridanus, Pach- 
nceus opalus, Rhodobcenus pustulosus. The first named two belong to those 
species of the West Indian colony which have already acquired the power 
of changing their food-habits and to extend their geographical range 
northward. They are now quite common anywhere in the peninsula of 
Florida. The third species, Artipus floridanus, is unquestionably also an 
immigrant from the West Indies, but does not seem to have been pre 
viously described from that locality. It is by far the commonest beetle in 
semi-tropical Florida, and, economically, of great importance. Its injury 
to lime trees has already been referred to by Mr. William H. Ashmead in 
his work on Orange Insects, but I found its destructive powers much more 



170 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

serious than told by Mr. Ashmead. It is a polyphagous species (at least 
in the imago state) and evidently spreading northward. As early as 1875 
I found it commonly at Haulover Canal, feeding on leaves of oak and ju 
niper, and in 1876 at New Smyrna. Both places being already north of 
the semi-tropicai boundary line, the occurrence of the species at St. Au 
gustine is not surprising. The fourth species, Pac/mceus opalus, originally 
described from Cuba, is also very abundant in semi-tropical Florida, and 
Mr. Ashrnead mentions it as being injurious to lime trees on the Florida 
Keys. I found it under the same conditions, though not nearly as de 
structive as the foregoing species. It occurs more commonly on the va 
rious fig trees, so characteristic of semi-tropical Florida, and most abun 
dantly on all sorts of succulent weeds. In view of this diversity in 
food-habit it is not astonishing to see this species extend its range north 
ward, but still, since I never found this weevil outside of semi-tropical 
Florida, I was quite surprised at seeing it on the St Augustine list. The 
occurrence at St. Augustine of the fifth species, Rhodobcenus pttstulosus, 
is of great interest and quite new to me, since it was previously known 
only from southern Arizona and Mexico. It adds another instance to that 
curious geographical distribution to which I referred in my paper on the 
insect fauna of semi-tropical Florida, viz., the simultaneous occurrence of 
certain species in the extreme southwestern and southeastern parts of 
North America. Of the food-habits of this Rhodobcenus I know nothing, 
but suspect from its general appearance that it belongs to the Yucca or 
Opuntia insects. At any rate it will be found also at other points of the 
Florida coast further south, and also in parts of Central America south of 
Mexico. 

Of the five semi-tropical species on the St. Augustine list, the occurrence 
of three is in accordance with the previously known distribution, that of 
the fourth is not surprising, and only that of the fifth is a novel and in 
teresting fact. Of the maritime semi-tropical fauna not a single species 
appears in the St. Augustine list. Thus, taking in account that the semi- 
tropical Coleopterous fauna of Florida amounts to several hundred species, 
it may safely be said that St. Augustine is well outside of the limits of 
this fauna. 

Turning now to the bulk of the species in the list we find that they 
consist of the usual admixture of more or less widely-distributed species 
and true Floridian forms, the proportion being but little different from 
that of other localities, e. g., Crescent City, Enterprise, Tampa. Among 
the true Floridian species on the St. Augustine list I am glad to see but 
few additions to the list published by me in 1878, including the manuscript 
additions since that time. I say I am glad thereof because it proves that 
our knowledge of the Florida fauna is already tolerably complete. But 
the St. Augustine list contains another element, viz., species belong 
ing to the faunal region lying directly north of eastern Florida and 
comprising lower Georgia, the lower Carolinas, and eastern Virginia. 
This is an ill-defined region with very few, or no, peculiar species, and 



OF WASHINGTON. 171 

only characterized by a certain combination of a number of southern 
species. The existence of this faunal region will become evident to any 
one who, on a summer day, goes from here down to Fortress Monroe, Va. 
The difference between the Washington fauna and that of Fortress Mon 
roe will then be found quite striking. Of this fauna I noticed about 
twenty species in the St. Augustine list not previously known from 
Florida. 

In conclusion, I would say that since the publication of my Florida list 
of Coleoptera I have carefully noted down in manuscript all additional 
species found afterwards in or recorded from Florida. These additions 
from all available sources swell the total of Coleoptera known to occur in 
Florida to about 12,400 species. A republication of this list is, however, 
not contemplated at present. 

Mr. Smith made some remarks on Lachnosterna, indicating 
the result obtained by an examination of the genital structure of 
some of the more common species.

The following paper was read by Mr. Schwarz : 

ENTOMOLOGY IN GARCILASSO'S " CONOJLJEST OF FLORIDA." 

BY E A. SCHWARZ. 

Ynca Garcilasso de la Vega is not the oldest, but by far the fullest, of the 
three original historians of the famous expedition of Hernando de Soto 
through North America. The author is best known by his " History of 
Peru," his native country, and in this work he has paid a great deal of at 
tention to natural history, and especially to zoology. Although he had 
never been himself in North America, I hoped to find in his account of 
De Soto's expedition at least some allusion to the insects of Florida,* and 
this the more so, since the author during the preparation of his work 
(completed, according to his own statement, in 1591, but not published 
before 1605) was able to get direct information from several survivors of 
the expedition. But I was disappointed ; the book contains not the slight 
est allusion to insects, in fact, hardly any to zoology, and only a single pas 
sage which in any way is related to entomology. The only thought of the 
Spaniards being to find precious metals, they paid of course no attention 
to anything else, and least to the zoology of the countries they traversed. 
The book teems with lengthy narrations of many unimportant incidents 



*It must be remembered that the Florida of Garcilasso's time comprised 
the whole of North America south of Canada and east of New Mexico. 



172 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

during the expedition, but no allusion is made to the various insect pests 
which annoy man and horses, and with which the Spaniards must have 
become acquainted here for the first time. That they were accustomed to 
the various lice, the fleas, and the bed-bugs there can be no doubt; in fact, 
some of these parasites were perhaps introduced then into North America 
by this expedition. But there is no mention of Sand-flies (Ceratopogon}, 
Red Bugs {Leptus irritans), and Mosquitoes. The absence of any refer 
ence to mosquitoes appears to be especially strange, since these insects were 
undoubtedly just as numerous then in our swamps as they are now, and 
since the Spaniards in their camps must have occasionally suffered terribly 
from their attacks. The absence of any reference to Horse-flies is also 
remarkable, since the horses were the most valuable property of the Span 
ish invaders. To them alone they owed their superiority in the constant 
fights with the Indians, and the death of a horse, either in battle or by 
drowning, is always carefully recorded by Garcilasso. I think, however, 
that at that time the various species of Tabanus were by far less numer 
ous in specimens than they are at present. The Indians had no domestic 
animals ; there were no buffaloes in the southeastern part of the country, 
and deer and other large warm-blooded animals weie probably then not 
much more numerous than they were up to a comparatively recent period. 
The introduction of domestic animals by the Europeans is no doubt the 
cause of the increase in the number of Horse-flies, which in some portions 
of the South are now a rather serious drawback to successful agriculture. 

The onlj' passage having any connection with entomology occurs toward 
the end of Garcilasso's work, when the situation is as follows : In 1543 the 
remnants of De Soto's expedition sail down the Mississippi river to its 
mouth, thence westward along the coast. After infinite hardship they 
reach the mouth of a river, which proved to be the Panuco river, on the 
coast of Mexico, and ascending the same they come to the capital of that 
section, where they meet their countrymen, the City of Mexico being only 
60 leagues distant. Garcilasso now says as follows, the translation being 
verbatim:* "The Spaniards praised God for this luck, and remained 10 
or 12 days at Panuco. But since the majority found out that the inhab 
itants subsisted only on such things as the land produced ; that several 
occupied themselves only with planting Spanish mulberry trees in the 
hope of having silk; that those which were best off raised only a few 
horses to sell them to the foreign merchants; that all of them were en 
tirely poor, poorly housed, and the land miserable," then they regretted 
having left the rich Florida, etc. 

This passage, which has evidently slipped into Garcilasso's book by mere 
accident, does not convey any new information, for we know from other 
independent sources that silk industry was introduced into Mexico at a very 
early date, when Cortez was still viceroy of that country; but I fail to 
find in several histories of silk-culture which I consulted any reference to 



*I translate from the French edition, Leyden, 1731, p. 544. 



OF WASHINGTON. 173 

this passage in Garcilasso, and for this reason I thought it worth while to 
call attention thereto. Long before the end of the i6th century every 
trace of silk-culture in Mexico had disappeared, and its breakdown is clearly 
foreshadowed in Garcilasso's words just quoted. They show that as early 
as 1543 there "was no money" in silk industry, and that this was held in 
contempt by the average Spaniard. The omission in the passage, no 
doubt by accident, of any mention of raising silk-worms, only stating that 
the people planted mulberry trees, is nevertheless very significant, and 
reminds one forcibly of that period in the history of silk industry in North 
America known as the Multicaulis fever, when silk-culture was carried on, 
not by raising silk-worms, but by planting mulberry trees of the multicaulis 
variety with a view of selling them at exorbitant prices under the pretext 
that there was an enormous profit in that business. As every one knows, 
this fever terminated suddenly and disastrously in the year 1839. 

Dr. Fox gave sotne notes on the spiders collected by him dur 
ing the summer of iSSS, at Lookout Mountain, Tenn. He gave 
some notes on the habits of the species of Lycosa found by him 
and on their distribution. Two species of Dolomedes were found 
around an old vat, long since disused, and only supplied by a 
very small mountain brook. The habits of the species were de 
scribed and the manner of formation of the little colony here found 
was suggested. He also called attention to the habits of Lycosa 
nidifex Marx, which, as observed by him, are somewhat different 
than described by Dr. Marx. The nest, as he observed it, has a 
chamber near the bottom. 

He also stated that he found a species of Argyrodes in one 
corner of the web of Hypochilus. 

Dr. Marx said as to Lycosa nidifex his observations were 
correctly described, but he is quite ready to believe that the 
habits of the spider differ somewhat in different localities. As 
to Argyrodes this observation is in accord with the known 
habits of the genus, which builds no webs of its own, but lives 
cuckoo-like in the nests of other species. He added that this is 
the season when gossamer spiders can be Best observed, and 
that he has already seen them in large numbers. 

Mr. Howard suggested that it would be also a good season to 
collect egg-bags of spiders with the view of raising parasite's, as 
in this country but few such were known. Prof. Riley suggested 
that larvae of Mantispa might also be obtained. 

Prof. Riley also spoke of the habits of a species of Agalena 



174 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

which he finds in some abundance on his grounds. This species 
pulls off leaves and small twigs and makes large nests. 

He has never been able to get at the reason for these large 
structures, since they do not seem to be required for the purpose 
of obtaining food. He asked whether any of the species might 
possibly be herbivorous. Drs. Marx and Fox said there was no 
record of an herbivorous habit for any spider. 

Prof. Riley also made some remarks on the habits of Atypus, 
describing the method by which the spider gets rid of the debris 
after exhausting its prey. Dr. Marx said that the spider is in 
the habit of taking its prey through the tube, remaining on the 
watch inside, and grasping any fly or other insect that may be 
unfortunate enough to alight on it, so that in many cases the 
prey is never taken into the tube at all. 

Mr. Smith, commenting on the statement in the last number of 
" Insect Life" regarding the habits of Stomoxys, says, that the 
fly is very abundant at his house ; that he has not been able to ob 
serve any increase in numbers in rainy weather, but on the con 
trary he has found them gradually becoming more abundant 
until at this time they have almost replaced the common Musca 
domestica, which is being rapidly killed off by the fungus that 
attacks this species at this season. Stomoxys is not attacked by 
this fungus in his experience. He also said that common as the 
species is at his place, neither he nor any member of his family 
has ever been bitten or stung by it either in wet or dry weather. 
Mr. Mann said the species was very common at Cambridge and 
bit severely. Mr. Schwarz says that he has been bitten through 
pants and stockings very severely. 

Prof. Riley thinks that Mr. Smith's experience is rather un 
usual, but said that where it so nearly replaced the common 
species its habits might be different. 

This subject was further discussed by Messrs. Schwarz, How 
ard, and Alwood. 

Mr. Schwarz read a series of 

COLEOPTEROLOGICAL NOTES.

A NEW HERBARIUM PEST. In the spring of this year I received from 
Mr. L. E. Ricksecker a little Ptinid beetle with the note that it infested the 
herbarium of the California Academy of Sciences at San Francisco, the

plants, and especially the papers, being badly perforated by both the larvze 
and the beetles. The species was determined as Trigonogenius farctns, 
but upon examination it proved to be quite distinct.* Although I have not 
yet been able to compare specimens I feel quite confident that this herba 
rium pest is identical with Sphcericus gibbiodes Boield., which is reported 
from Italy, Corsica, and Algeria. It does not appear to be common in Euro 
pean collections, and I fail to find any reference to its life-historvand food- 
habits. At any rate it has never been known as an injurious insect, and 
its appearance in California is certainly interesting enough to be placed on 
record. Mr. Ricksecker was kind enough to send me some living larvae, 
but before they reached me they had changed to pupae within delicate silken 
cocoons spun among the dried plants in which they were sent. When and 
how this insect was introduced into California I am unable to tell, and I 
may only add that Mr. Ricksecker found a few specimens in San Fran 
cisco as early as iSSo. 

SCOLYTID^E ATTACKING TAMARAC TREES. Up to the year 1884 the only 
knowledge we had on the subject was a short notice by Dr. Fitch, in his 
4th Report, p. 65, stating that Tomicuspini attacks not only pines but also 
tamaracs. In the Report of the Annual Meeting of the Ent. Soc. of Ontario 
for 1884 (Canad. Ent., xiv, 1884, p. 218)), Mr. W. H. Harrington speaks of 
a grove of tamarac trees in various stages of health and decay, " the cause 
of the latter seeming to be a Scolytid beetle of the genus Dendroctonus, 
which was found in immense number under bark of sickly and dying trees. 
The bark was completely undermined and riddled by its galleries, and 
swarmed with larvae, pupae, and beetles." There is no subsequent refer 
ence to this Dendroctonus, and the species remains therefore unnamed, 
but I think I am able to supply the determination. In 1881 or '82, Mr. 
Hubbard and myself visited a tamarac swamp near Grand Ledge, Mich., 
and we found under bark of dying tamaracs numerous specimens of a 
Dcndroctonus, which, no doubt, is identical with that referred to by Mr. 
Harrington, and which I determined as D. simplex.^ In July of the pres 
ent year I found again at Marquette, Mich., some tamaracs which had been 
infested by this species. The inner side of the bark was so completely 
honey-combed with the galleries of the larvae and the beetles that I did 

* At the time this note was read before the Society I considered this spe 
cies as undescribed, since it greatly differs from Trigonogenius farctus, 
the only species in our fauna with which it can be compared. A subse 
quent search in the European literature induced me to change my view and 
to alter my manuscript accordingly. The genus Trigonogenius is now 
restricted to a few species from the west coast of America (Chili, Peru, 
and Lower California), the corresponding species of the Old World being 
referred to Sphcericus Woll. (Tipnus J. DuV.) The differences between 
the two genera are clearly set forth by J. DuVal (Genera des Col., iii, pp. 
210-211). 

f I consider this merely a small race of D. rufipennis. 



176 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

not succeed in finding a piece of bark which would show the nature of the 
galleries. The beetles had long since deserted the trees, and all I could 
find were several dead specimens which served for identification. I am in 
clined to doubt that this Scolytid is the first cause of the decay of the 
tamarac, since I partake of the opinion of those who believe that in a 
country without forest cultivation Scolytids attack only diseased or other 
wise injured trees, and healthy trees only when they are cultivated in our 
gardens and parks. The gradual drying up of the tamarac swamps, in 
consequence of the improved drainage of the country, is, I think, the first 
and main cause of the decay of tamarac trees in Michigan and elsewhere. 

Mr. Harrington continues : "Associated with them [the Dendroctonus] 
were large numbers of a smaller bark-borer, Hylesinus opaculus, with one 
or two other species, which would not be likely from their habits or num 
bers to do much injury." What the "one or two other species" may be I 
am unable to say, but it is certain that Mr. Harrington's Hylesinus opaculus 
is simply a wrong determination. This species lives on certain deciduous 
trees, viz., elm and ash, but never attacks Conifers. Mr. Harrington's 
species is either Polygraphus rufipennis or Phlceosinus serratus, or possi 
bly also a species yet unknown to me. The food-habits of most Scolytidce 
are so particular that a mere knowledge of them enables us to control the 
correct determination of the species. 

MALE CHARACTERS IN PISSODES AFFINIS. The male of this species 
can be distinguished by the following characters : Hind tibise curved at 
apical half, their inner edge flattened, smooth and shining, and furnished 
at the apical third with a brush of long black hair. This character can be 
observed even without the aid of a lens, and at once distinguishes P. affinis 
from the other eastern species in which the tibiae are alike in both sexes. 
The few specimens of our western Pissodes which I was able to examine 
show also no distinguishing sexual characters. 

THE FEMALE OF PHOTINUS COLLUSTRANS. Only one species (Ph. 
scintillans} of this genus was hitherto known to differ strikingly from the 
male by being wingless and having short elytra, but from a specimen found 
by Mr. H. G. Hubbard at Crescent City, Fla., it appears that the female 
of Ph. colhistrans possesses the same characters. The head and thorax in 
the female of this species are much smaller than in the male; the eyes are 
also much smaller, and the antennas shorter and stouter; thorax and elytra 
are colored and sculptured as in the male, but the elytra, which are a little 
narrowed posteriorly, do not quite reach to the posterior margin of the 
second dorsal abdominal segment; wings entirely absent; abdomen twice 
as long as the combined length of thorax and elytra, but not inflated in the 
single specimen before me, and of a nearly uniform yellow color, so that 
nothing can be said regarding the extent of the light-organs. The abdo 
men has, however, the appearance of being luminous throughout. The 
last segment has a smooth longitudinal impression at the middle of the 
base, and the stigma-like impressions at the sides of the segments are ab 
sent. I feel quite confident now that the female of Ph. puncfulatus, 



OF WASHINGTON. 177 

which is still unknown, will prove also to be wingless and provided with 
short elytra. 

NOTES ON SINOXYLON. The number of antennal joints in certain genera 
of Ptinid<z is known to be subject to individual variation, and the irregu 
larities mentioned by Dr. LeConte (Proc. Amer. Philos Soc , xvii, 1878, 
p. 612) in Hadrobregmus linearis can also be observed in other species of 
this and allied genera of the sub-family Anobiince. In the sub-family Bos- 
trychince the number of antennal joints appears to be much more constant, 
and Dr. Horn has successfully used this character for grouping the species 
of some of our genera. I had this year the opportunity of examining a 
large number of Sinoxylon basilare, found in dead branches of Persimmon 
{Diospyros caroliniana), and only o,ne specimen showed an irregularity in 
the number of antennal joints. The specimen has but 9 joints in both 
antennae ; no joint of the funicle is missing, but instead of a three-jointed 
club the specimen has a well-formed two-jointed club alike in both antennae. 
The first joint of the club, formed by the coalescence of the first and second 
joints in normallv developed specimens, is oblong, as long as the six pre 
ceding joints together, and with the inner apical angle somewhat produced ; 
the last joint of the club does not show any deviation. Moreover, in the 
right antenna of the specimen the sixth and seventh joints show a decided 
tendency to coalesce. The specimen is plainly an abnormity, and other 
wise not distinguishable from the normal type ; but any one not acquainted 
with our 5". basilare might be tempted to establish a new genus on such 
specimens. 

5". texanum closely resembles the smaller specimens of 6". basilare in color 
ation and appearance. I found several specimens last year near Washing 
ton, D. C., but failed to make notes on their food-plants since I mistook 
them at first for. 5. basilare, which lives in all sorts of dead branches. 

S.Jloridamtm belongs to the colony of West Indian species in semi- 
tropical Florida. Specimens from Jamaica, which I received from Dr. 
John Hamilton, cannot be distinguished from those found in Florida. 

A discussion arose between Messrs. Riley, Howard, Schwarz, 
and Smith on the constancy of the number of antennal joints in 
insects, and their value in classification.

Dr. Marx read the following paper 

ON THE IMPORTANCE OF THE STRUCTURAL CHARACTERS OF HYPOCHILUS 
IN THE CLASSIFICATION OF SPIDERS. 

BY GEO. MARX, M. D. 

The first great subdivision of the order Aranecz, based upon the struc 
tural characters alone, is that into the two sub-orders : Dipneumones, or 
spiders which possess two lamellar tracheae or lung-sacs, and Tetrapneu 
mones, or those with' four lungs.* 

The species of these two sub-orders are distinguished not only by the 
number of their lung-sacs, but by other structural differences, as the shape 
of the cephalothorax and abdomen, the size of the legs, the form of the 
trophi, male palpus and spinnerets ; in short, by their entire morphological 
appearance. 

But there is in the Dipneumones a small group of families which present 
in one respect or another certain affinities with the Tetrapneumones. This 
relationship manifests itself, however, not so much in the general appear 
ance of these animals as in a more or less distinctly expressed similarity 

* We have also a division of this order into seven tribes ("somewhat like 
sub-orders), which are founded upon biological facts : (i) In regard to the 
kind of web or net they spin, as Orbitelarice, making a round, geometrical 
net; Retitelarice, making a snare or loose reticulum ; Tubitelarice, those 
which attach to their flat, horizontal catch-web a tube in which they dwell 
and watch ; and the Territelarice, which make a weaving in or on the 
ground (Trap-door spiders and others); and (2) in regard to the mode of 
running, as Citigradce^ or swift runners; Laterigradce, or side runners; 
and Saltigrad(z, or jumping spiders. TheTerritelarise alone represent the 
Tetrapneumones, while the six other tribes constitute the Dipneumones. 



OF WASHINGTON. 179 

of certain parts or organs, the family Filistatidce having four external 
stigmata, the posterior pair, however, aborted, showing also their affinity 
by the shape of the cephalothorax, by the stoutness of the legs, and the 
pubescence and color. Dysderidce, belonging also to this group, possess 
also four external stigmata, but the posterior pair lead not to lamellar, but 
to common tubular tracheae ; they also have the mandibular claws inserted 
much as in the four-lungers; that is, nearly vertical, instead of horizontal, 
as is the case of all other Dipneumonic spiders. 

Without these exceptions or transition-forms the two sub-orders seemed 
to be well separated, to be two natural groups, well defined in their struc 
tural characters. They seemed so until Hypochilus was discovered.* 

Hypochilus is a Tetrapneumonic spider as well as a Dipneumonic one, 
for it has four lung-sacs, the vertical insertion of the mandibular claws, 
and the form and position of the labium proper to the former sub-order 
(the labium at least of some of the Territclaricz}, while it corresponds 
in the following characters with the two-lungers, especially with those ex 
pressed in the above-mentioned group of transition forms. 

With the Filistatidce it has the cribellum and calamistrum and the ar 
rangement of the eight eyes, and with the Dysderidce the insertion of the 
mandibular claws, the four external stigmata, and the form of the male 
palpus ; but it is also closely related to the Scytodidce, not only by some 
external features, but (as Prof. Bertkau, of Bonn, informs me) by 
anatomical homologies, and even with the Pholcidce with these princi 
pally by the extremely long and slender legs, the shape of the body, and 
the similarity in the arrangement of the eyes. 

The Dysderidce and Filistatitlfg \xswe already by our arachnologists been 
placed at the end of the line of Dipneumonic families, opposite the Tetra- 
pnenmones, and Prof. Simon, of France, has added to this group the Scy- 
todidce (sub-order Gnaphosce). Now comes Hypochilus, standing directly 
in the gap that separates the two sub orders, leaning on one side upon the 
Filistatidce, on the other on Territelarice, connecting thus both divisions 
and obliterating their differentiating characters. 

The line of families would now, according to the order of their natural 
development, be formed as follows : 

Liphistatidce, Theraphosidce, Katadysidcef ? ), Hypochilidce, Filistatidce, 
Dysderidce, Scytodidce, Pholcidce, Drassidce, and so forth, to the Epeiridce 
as the most highly developed family. 

Prof. Bertkau propo%ed, in 1882, a new classification, and divided the 
order Aranece into two sub-orders, according to the presence or absence 
of those peculiar organs, the cribellum and calamistrum. 

The Cribellata are those provided with these organs. This sub-order, 
however, contains the most heterogeneous families in spite of the great en

Hypochilus^ so as to admit it into the camp of the Cribellata, would be a 
mighty difficult task. 

Blackwall, of England, united three genera, which all were provided 
with a cribellum and calamistrutn, into one family, the Ciniflonidce. Since 
then, as more species were found possessing these organs, but which could 
not be brought into the scope of a family, the family Ciniflonidce became 
abandoned. 

Now, unfortunately, Mr. J. H. Emerton lately revived that obsolete 
family, and described the New England members, in all five genera, under 
the old head. Had he not confined himself to that limited region he would 
have had to add two prominent genera from the United States, Filistata 
and Dinops, and it would have been extremely difficult for him at that time 
to admit into the defined compass of a family these two heterogeneous 
genera. The difficulty is now enhanced by the appearance of Hypochilus, 
and the fallacy in forming a family upon such grounds is obvious. 

In the discussion upon this communication, Prof. Riley said 
he thought the existing classification of spiders might yet be of 
use, although apparently upset by the discovery of connecting 
forms. He also urged upon Dr. Marx the importance of a study 
of the species of Theraphosidas. Dr. Marx stated that as yet the 
classification of the Theraphosidae was in such an unsatisfactory 
condition that a determination of species could not well be 
made. Ausserer's table of the genera of the family was not made 
with the fauna of this country in view, and the generic distinctions 
were too finely drawn and not applicable to our fauna. The 
family is divided naturally into three sub-families, Atypinas, 
Eriodoninae, and Theraphosinag, with the great bulk of the family 
in the last. 

Mr. Howard remarked that he had recently read in the Trans 
actions of the New Zealand Institute for 1869 an account of the 
" katipo," or poisonous spider of New Zealand, which appears 
to be a species of Latrodectus. This is found on the sea beach 
among sedges. It is stated that this spider is not feared by the 
natives at the distance of half the throw of a stone from the beach. 

Mr. Ashmead said that in a peach orchard planted by Col. Red 
man near Jacksonville, Fla., the trees had been defoliated by a 
spider. Mr. Ashmead stated positively he had seen the spiders 
at work on the leaves.

latter had been found by Mr. Koebele in California on beaver 
skins received from Alaska. The relations of these larvae to 
those of Platypsyllus were pointed out. 

Prof. Riley also made a communication on the manner of 
oviposition in Thalessa. Thalessa is proved to be an external 
parasite of Tremex. In laying its eggs it usually inserts its 
ovipositor into a hole made by some insect which has emerged 
from the infested tree, but it is able to penetrate solid wood. The 
jaws of the larva of Thalessa are not adapted to boring in wood. 
J. A. Lintner and J. S. Woodward have stated that Thalessa also 
deposits its eggs in larvae of Datana, but Prof. Riley believes 
this to be an erroneous statement, and as Heteropelma resembles 
Thalessa, and has been reared from Datana integerrima and 
D. ministra, it is probable that these authors have mistaken 
Heteropelma for Thalessa.* 

Mr. Schwarz exhibited a Telamona having a globular sac pro

ANNUAL ADDRESS OF THE PRESIDENT. 

ON THE COLEOPTERA COMMON TO NORTH AMERICA AND OTHER 

COUNTRIES. 
BY E. A. SCHWARZ. 

As the subject of my address I beg leave to present a partial 
classification of those numerous species of Coleoptera, which are 
more or less widely distributed over the great faunal regions of 
the globe. As a basis for such classification I have attempted 
to compile lists of those species of the Nearctic fauna which 
occur also in other continents. These lists, if complete, ought to 
include not only a comparison of our own fauna with the other 
faunal regions of the New World and with that of the boreal and 
temperate zones of the Old World, but also with the Ethiopian, 
the Oriental, and the Polynesian faunas. The connection be 
tween our own and the last-named faunal region.s is, however, 
so small as to be hardly worth while to be taken into considera 
tion here, since it is reduced to a certain class of species which 
are common to all faunal regions of the world, viz., the Cosmo 
politan species, and to a very few other species w^hich, though 
widely distributed within the tropical or semi-tropical zones, have 
not acquired the faculty of spreading into the temperate zone. 

A compilation of the list of species common to North and 
South America proved to be beyond my ability, owing to various 
circumstances. There is not a single good collection of South 
American Coleoptera in the United States which would serve as 
base for comparison ; there is an almost complete absence of 
catalogues of South American Coleoptera, and the literature is 
enormously scattered and, to a large proportion, inaccessible to 
me. Thus my list has remained a mere fragment. 

There is but little difficulty in compiling a list of the species 
common to North America and the PalaBarctic fauna. Careful 
comparisons of most species belonging to both faunas have been 
made by various authors ; there is no want of catalogues, and 
even partial lists of the species common to both regions have been 
published. Among our own authors, Dr. LeConte was very fond 
of referring to this subject in his writings and gave on several 



OF WASHINGTON. 183 

occasions more or less extended lists, which,' however, are mere 
fragments, because they served only to illustrate certain special 
features. It is certainly strange that hitherto a complete list of 
such species has not been published.* In following up the his 
tory of many of these species it is interesting to see how much 
difficulty has been and is still experienced by entomologists in 
coming to an understanding regarding the identity or non-identity 
of species from widely-separated regions, difficulties that illus 
trate the powerful influence of difference in habitat upon our 
conception of the term species. Usually the species were first 
described independently under different names, then, either by 
comparison of specimens or descriptions, they were declared 
to be identical ; then there came a period when more or less 
minute differences were pointed out between such species ; 
then a reaction set in in the opposite direction, and this state of 
uncertainty regarding many species will no doubt continue for an 
indefinite time. A complete list of the Coleoptera common to 
both continents can also not be given as long as certain smaller or 
larger portions of our fauna are not more fully studied or, at any 
rate, not yet compared with the Old World's species. Here be 
long the whole family of Cryptophagidce, the subfamily Aleo- 
charincz of the Staphylinidce with an almost endless number of 
species, and some other genera of various families. Incomplete 
as it is, my list comprises 440 species. f It is, however, by no 
means my intention to read this list, or any portions thereof, but 
as the cause of the simultaneous occurrence in different regions is 
not the same for all species, I propose to offer a few general re 
marks on the various phases which this subject assumes. 

The simultaneous occurrence of identical species in regions 
separated by wide stretches of ocean, or other great natural 
boundaries, can only be explained, ist, by NATURAL DISPERSION ; 

* Since this was written a very carefully elaborated list of the Coleoptera 
common to North America and Europe has been published by Dr. John 
Hamilton in Trans. Amer. Ent. Soc., v. 16, 1889, pp. 88-162, which has 
been reprinted, with additions and corrections, by an equally competent 
European Entomologist, Mr. Albert Fauvel, in Revue d'Entomologie, v. 
8, 1889, pp. 92-174. 

f Fauvel enumerates 495 species.

or, zd, by the AGENCY OF MAN. A third mode of explanation, 
viz., that specifically identical specimens occurring in widely 
separated places could be the descendants of two specifically dif 
ferent ancestors, is not longer admissible in the present state of 
Natural Science. 

As a further subdivision, the following scheme is proposed : 

I. NATURAL DISPERSION. 

a. The Circumpolar fauna. 

b. Species not belonging to the circumpolar fauna, probably of 
intratropical origin, which have spread into the temperate zone. 

c. Migratory species. 

IT. DISPERSION BY THE AGENCY OF MAN. 

d. Intentional introductions. 

e. Non-intentional introductions. 
f. Non-intentional importations.* 



* Another subdivision quite different in character from those mentioned 
is, Importation by Coleopterists, or the Introduction of finned specimens. 
This is, of course, a ridiculous division, but nevertheless it occupies quite 
a space in our descriptive literature and has occasionally assumed a rather 
serious aspect. It results from the carelessness with which exotic speci 
mens, exchanged or purchased, are labelled and get mixed up with North 
American species, and are then either described or referred to as North 
American species. Some of our older authors made some such blun 
ders and even our best recent authorities, here and abroad, have been 
fooled by such specimens, and this mostly without any fault of their own. 
If a big South American Dynastid beetle is offered for sale in this country 
as a North American species, as can be seen from the advertising columns 
of one of our periodicals, no one, of course, can be deceived; but when 
it comes to an obscure species of a widely-distributed genus, the case is 
quite different. Most of these spurious species have now been detected and 
eliminated from our fauna, and, as a rule, it does not make much differ 
ence whether or not a number of them still linger in our list. In the 
course of time they all will be found out, but one or the other of them is 
liable to cause some inconvenience. As an example I mention the clover- 
leaf-weevil {Phytonomus punctatus}. Nearly ten years ago Dr. C. V. Riley 
called attention to and described the sudden appearance of this species in 
the State of New York. It turned out afterwards that Dr. LeConte had 
redescribed this European species under a different name from two old 
specimens in his collection, one coming from the Melsheimer collection, in 



OF WASHINGTON. 185 

The Circumpolar Fauna. There has been so much said and 
written on the circumpolar animals and plants, their origin, their 
movement southward during the Ice period, their retrograde move 
ment at the end of that geological epoch, and the formation dur 
ing this retrocession of more or less isolated colonies on very high 
mountain ranges ; so many ingenious generalizations and specu 
lations have been published by prominent botanists and zoolo 
gists, that I am unable to add anything new on this subject. As 
to the Coleoptera of that region we have an admirable paper by 
Prof. Maklin, which, although written more than 30 years ago, is 
by no means antiquated, and a perusal of which is to be recom 
mended to all interested in the matter. The southern limits of 
this fauna were laid down b}' Dr. LeConte, as early as 1859, 
on the map accompanying his paper on the Coleoptera of Kan 
sas, and subsequent experience has found nothing to make great 
alterations. This limit is, of course, not a sharply defined line. 
The Arctic fauna gradually fades away, and south of this line many 
species occur of undoubted circumpolar origin, but which, in the 
course of time and under changed climatic conditions, have become 
specifically differentiated, either both in the New and Old Worlds or 
only in one of the two continents. These are what Maklin called 
the " representative species," and they form a large proportion of 
the fauna of our Middle and Western States. Other species have 
in their southward extent preserved their specific identity, and can 
then often not, or with difficulty, be distinguished from the im 
ported species. Some of these have no doubt been reintroduced 
by the agency of man. 

In comparing the ranges of the circumpolar species in the Old 
and New World a striking difference is, in some instances, notice 
able, which deserves especial mention and which is best explained 
by some examples : Lina lapponica of the family Chrysomelidce, 
a variable but easily recognizable species which feeds on willow, 
occurs in all Arctic regions. In the Old World it occurs only in 
the high north and on high mountain ranges, whereas in North 

which exotic and American species were mixed and often without locality 
labels, the other specimen being still more doubtful regarding locality. 
These two specimens may or may not be from North America, but the in 
teresting question regarding the time of introduction can never be 
answered with certainty. 



186 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

America it extends to the extreme southern portion of the coun 
try. Another equally easily recognized species, Adoxus vitis, 
occurs throughout the Palaearctic region and lives upon a wild 
plant ( Galium) and upon grape-vine, doing so much damage 
thereto that, in France, it has received a popular name, " le gri- 
burier." In our country the species is strictly arctic or alpine, 
feeds upon the same wild plant, but has never shown any dispo 
sition to feed upon grape-vine or to extend its range. Silpha 
lapponica occurs all over North America (except in the south 
east), being still common as far south as San Diego, Cal. In 
Europe it is strictly arctic, and does not even occur in the Alpine 
regions. On the other hand, Silpha opaca is common all over 
Europe, and has even acquired there some economic importance^ 
whereas the identical species is strictly arctic in North America 
(a single specimen in the LeConte cabinet is from the high Sierras 
of California). The following are examples of remarkable dis 
tribution of which I am unable to offer a satisfactory explanation : 
Nomius pygmczus, a neat-looking Carabid beetle, but justly 
dreaded by all those who had an opportunity of finding it, on ac 
count of its overpowering, foetid odor, occurs in Washington Ter 
ritory, Oregon, at Lake Superior, and on the high mountains of 
North Carolina, a distribution participated in by several species 
of distinctly arctic origin. The same species occurs as an extreme 
rarity in southern Europe, specimens being occasionally found in 
southern France, Hungary, and Greece. An importation of this 
species, which is by no means common even in North America, 
by the agency of man is utterly inconceivable. Aphodius rufipes, 
a species common all over Europe and Siberia, and in all proba 
bility belonging to the circumpolar fauna, occurs in North America 
only in the Alleghany Mountains, but not in the Arctic region. 
Hypocoprus lathridioides, a myrmecophilous species, is widely 
distributed in Europe, but has in North America been found only 
in the Subalpine region of Colorado. 

The mountain ranges in America run in the direction from 
north to south, and the colonies of circumpolar insects upon their 
summits have thus been able to preserve their connection and 
specific identity with the arctic forms ; whereas in Europe, where 
the mountain ranges run from east to west, the alpine colonies 
have generally undergone changes and, by isolation, lost their 



OF WASHINGTON. 187 

specific identity with the arctic species. There is, therefore, in 
the Old World an abundance of distinct alpine forms, none of 
which are identical with North American species ; while we, on 
our high mountains, have but few, if any, alpine, but more arctic 
forms. 

Our knowledge of the distributions of the circumpolar Coleop- 
tera has in recent years greatly increased, and we are now enabled 
in most instances to distinguish those which are strictly circum 
polar, i. <?., which occur in the Arctic or Boreal regions of the 
whole northern hemisphere, from those which are only partially 
circumpolar, i.e., which are either common to the boreal portions 
of Europe and eastern North America or to western North America 
(Alaska, British Columbia), and a larger or smaller portion of 
northern Asia. Among the strictly circumpolar Coleoptera the 
predaceous families predominate over the phytophagous families ; 
the Carabidce, Dytiscidce, Staphylinidce and Coccinellidce are 
well represented, the Chrysomelidce and Rhynchophora are 
tolerably well, and the Cerambycidcz and Elateridce are poorly 
represented. The Buprestidce are absent although this family 
contains numerous boreal species in every region. The phyto 
phagous Scar abce idee do not, or barely extend into the arctic 
regions ; the coprophagous Scarabceidce {Aphodius) are well 
represented there, still none of them (with the exception of 
Aphodius rufipes, which doubtfully belongs here) is on the list 
of circumpolar Coleoptera. This fact is the more remarkable 
since, if we go further south, we find a decided ability and dis 
position on the part of the Old World Aphodii to extend their 
range by introduction or natural spread from one faunal region to 
another. 

SPECIES NOT BELONGING TO THE CIRCUMPOLAR FAUNA. This 
division comprises endemic species of probably intratropical origin, 
which have spread, by natural dispersion, into the temperate zone 
of North America. I have already spoken of my inability to com 
pile, with the means at my command, a satisfactory list of these 
species, and I am unwilling to offer any further remarks thereon 
beyond stating that from this list all those numerous species ought 
to be excluded which belong to the semitropical fauna of Central 
America and which extend into the extreme southern part of 
North America, forming a sharply-defined colony in a narrow 



188 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

coast strip of southern Florida and an apparently less defined 
zone along the Mexican boundary. 

MIGRATORY SPECIES. There are very few migratory insects 
anyhow, and none among the Coleoptera, and I may therefore 
dismiss the subject with the remark that the occasional movements 
reported among Coleoptera I refer more particularly to certain 
apparently migratory swarms of Carabidse observed in temperate 
South America are alw r ays on a comparatively small scale, never 
extending from one faunal region to another, and that they are not 
comparable to the real migrations among certain species of Lepi- 
doptera and Orthoptera. 

DISPERSION BY THE AGENCY OF MAN. The second class of 
species common to our own and other faunal regions comprises 
those which have been or are being carried from one continent to 
another by the agency of man a vast number of species which 
were not distributed over portions of the New and Old World 
before the discovery of America, now nearly 400 years ago. At 
the first glance the subject appears to be a very simple one. We 
should expect that, with the increase of our marine intercourse, 
with the shortening of the steamer trips between all ports of the 
whole world, there should be going on an ever-increasing inter 
change of the faunas and floras of the continents. We should fur 
ther expect this intercourse to be most marked between those 
continents which lie under the same degrees of latitude of the same 
hemisphere and enjoy the same or nearly the same climate e. g., 
between Europe and North America ; this interchange to be less 
marked between countries which, although situated under the same 
latitude, show differences in climatic conditions e. g., between 
our Pacific coast, more especially California, and Japan or China ; 
this interchange to be much smaller if importation involve a de 
cided change of climate, as between any intratropical country and 
North America, or between the temperate zone of the southern 
hemisphere, through the tropics, into the temperate zone of the 
northern hemisphere. All this is supported by facts, but a glance 
at the list of species at once shows that there does not exist an in 
terchange between the faunas of the Old and New World, but 
only an introduction of Old World forms into North America, 
while North America has, with very few exceptions, never ex 
ported any of her native species. This phenomenon has long 



OF WASHINGTON. 189 

since attracted attention, and various explanations are offered for it. 
It has been said that there is some ancient and obscure natural law 
according to which the dispersion of animals and plants in the 
northern hemisphere takes place in the direction of from east to 
west. Others restrict the working of this law to the continents 
adjacent to the Atlantic ocean, supporting their theory by the geo 
graphical configuration of the continents Europe, with its un 
paralleled development of coast line, being naturally the country 
of exportation. Another apparently more plausible explanation is 
that the fauna and flora of the so-called New World (which is in 
reality the oldest continent \_are so weak and degenerated that they 
cannot compete with the younger' and more vigorous flora and 
fauna of the so-called Old World. Others have added that after 
all there is a climatic difference between Europe and North Amer 
ica which favors only the introduction of Old World species into 
North America. I must confess that I have notbecome convinced 
of the force of these explanations when applied to the introduc 
tion of insects. Some of our native dung-beetles of the genus 
Atcenius occur all over the continent, .from Canada to Patagonia, 
and exhibit, therefore, a considerable power of adaptation as to 
climate. Moreover, these species live in all stages, not only in 
dung but also in rich soil in other words, under conditions most 
favorable for exportation. How these species can be considered 
as less vigorous than the Old World species is difficult to under 
stand. Still thev have never been introduced into Europe. Our 
Stelidotas, certain Epuraeas, etc., which are so frequently found 
on apples and other fruits packed in barrels or boxes, have never 
been found in Europe. Trogoderma tarsale, of the family Der- 
mestidce, is only too well known to most of us as the most annoy 
ing museum pest. It not only infests dried insects, but also skins 
of stuffed animals, and with such objects it must have been trans 
ported to Europe, not only once but frequently, and must have 
been founds*, least at many places in Europe. Still, one can hunt 
through the whole coleopterological literature of Europe without 
finding any notice of its occurrence in that country. This in 
stance appears to be quite inexplicable, unless it turns out from 
comparison of specimens that Trogoderma tar sale is identical 
with a European species ( T. ornatum) . 

Still, our American fauna has furnished at least a few contribu- 



190 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

tions to the list of cosmopolitan species. The Archippus butter 
fly (Danals archippus}, an undoubted endemic American spe 
cies, though probably not a native of the North American fauna ; 
the grape phylloxera {Phylloxera vasfatrix), undoubtedly of 
North American origin, are familiar examples. Among the cos 
mopolitan Coleoptera, Trogosita mauritanica^ Silvanus cassice, 
and perhaps other species of the same genus, Lasioderma serri- 
corne, Arceocerus fasciculatus* and some others, may with a 
greater or smaller degree of probability be claimed as natives of 
America. The notorious Colorado potato beetle {Doryphora 
io-lineatd} may also be adduced here as an example. It has, on 
several occasions, migrated across the Atlantic, and would no doubt 
have become acclimatized in Europe but for the energetic and 
successful measures for its extermination. 

INTENTIONAL INTRODUCTIONS. These include our domestic 
insects (honey-bee, silk-worm) , but there are no Coleoptera among 
them. The only species which may claim to be considered here 
are certain species of meal beetles, Tenebrio molitor, obscurus 
and opacus, the larvae of which, used as food for insectivorous 
song-birds, have been carried intentionally all over the world. 
But since these beetles and their larvae flourish in old flour, corn, 
cheese, etc., I suppose that, even without the assistance of man, 
they would have become cosmopolitan long ago. No attempts 
have been made hitherto intentionally to introduce beneficial pre- 
daceous Coleoptera such as Carabidce and Coccinellidce ; but I 
see the time is fast approaching when such attempts will be made 
in this country.* Some queer and unexpected experience will 
then be made, as I shall point out presently. 

NON-INTENTIONAL IMPORTATIONS AND NON-INTENTIONAL 
INTRODUCTIONS. There is an important difference between these 
two topics, but as this difference can be explained best by contrast 
ing them they are considered at the same time. 

With our fast steamers, our lightning trains, our refrigerators, 
with our increased and increasing knowledge of the food habits 
and general natural history of insects, I assert that man. is able to 
transport safely almost any species of insect from any part of the

troducing and acclimatizing several Australian species of Coccinellidce in

temperate zone of the Old World to any other part of the temperate 
zone of the New World, the difficulties only arising and increas 
ing if a change of climate is involved in this introduction. I re 
member here the introduction of the humble-bee from England to 
New Zealand, which was successful after repeated failures. Al 
most the same may be said of the unintentional mode of importa 
tion. With the almost endless list of objects of modern commerce 
and international intercourse, numerous species of insects of all 
Orders, and more especially Coleoptera, are imported by everv 
steamer arriving at New York or at any other great port of this 
country from any part of the world, and can, in the warmer season, 
be found alive about the wharves. I remind you here of a com 
munication by our fellow-member, Mr. Lugger, before this So 
ciety, on the large number of species of exotic Coleoptera found 
in Baltimore near the landing places of steamers. Now if only 
the tenth part, or even a much smaller proportion, of such im 
ported species should become introduced species, it is safe to say 
that within a couple of years the fauna of the vicinity of Boston, 
New York, Baltimore, and San Francisco would be so 
changed as to be utterly strange to us North American Coleopte- 
rists. Enough has been said to point out that there is an essential 
difference between importation and introduction, which is ex 
pressed by the single word '* acclimatization." This at once 
changes the aspect of things. In spite of the constant importation 
of hundreds of species the faunas of New York, San Francisco, 
etc., have not been perceptibly altered in the course of nearly 400 
years. The recorded number of introduced Coleoptera during 
the past three years amounts to only four or five, and I am by no 
means satisfied that all these cases are really introductions. Some 
may be imported species, and they were captured and recorded 
before anything could be known regarding their ability to become 
thoroughly acclimatized in jthis country. The terms successful 
importation and successful introduction are even now sometimes 
considered tantamount, and a successful introduction announced 
when it could be only an importation. It is, of course, important 
for various reasons to record any importations ; but we must watch 
and wait several seasons before we can judge about introduction. 
We stand here before some great unknown factor viz., the in 
dividual nature and inmost character of the species, which gov- 



192 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

erns the introduction or non-introduction of each species a factor 
which is variable according to each species and over which man 
has no control and is likely never to have any. Look at the re 
corded introduction of European species which, as stated before, 
are so readily transported into North America. There are many 
examples where the introduction of very common species has not 
taken place at all, or where it suddenly takes place after 400 years 
of non-introduction, or where introduction has taken place under 
the most improbable circumstances. There is a common Euro 
pean fly, Eristalis tenax, which in the larva state lives in all 
sorts of dirty and slimy places, so as to present the most readily 
available species for transportation and introduction into North 
America. Still it has taken nearly 400 years to accomplish this 
introduction, and when it was finally accomplished the species 
spread with incredible rapidity all over the United States. I men 
tion this sample of the Order Diptera, because Baron Osten Sac- 
ken has given us a most interesting paper on the intricacy of this 
subject, published in the Transactions of the London Entomologi 
cal Society for 1884. There is in Europe a common ladybird, 
Coccinella j-punctata., in habit very much alike to C. bipunc- 
tata, which has long since been introduced here. Still the former 
has never shown any disposition to become Americanized, al 
though it has probably more than once been brought in ships to 
our shores. This instance is paralleled in the European Sar- 
cophaga carnaria. Numerous examples may be brought forth 
to show that successful introduction has taken place under rather 
improbable conditions e. g. , \nPklceotrya Vaudoueri. This 
is a rare species, apparently not belonging to the circumpolar 
fauna, and which occurs in southern France, its larva probably 
living in the decaying wood of forest trees. Still, it must have 
been imported at some time, and is now to be found in many 
widely separated localities in the United States. Many European 
species of the genus Pkilontkus and other large genera have found 
their way to North America. Many other equally common spe 
cies have hitherto refused to be transported and introduced. Many 
of the introduced species have spread with great rapidity e. g., 
Scolytus rugulosus, which, being evidently a recent importation, 
occurs now from Georgia to Ohio and northern New York. 
Hylesinus trifolii, also recently introduced, extends now from

New York to Canada and Michigan. Others, on the contrary, 
seem to be entirely unable to extend their range from the spot 
where they had established themselves in this country ", 
Malachius ceneus, which, since many years, is found in the 
vicinity of Boston and nowhere else. Nacerdes melanura is now 
one of the commonest species in our eastern cities, and lives un 
der conditions apparently most favorable for its further spread, 
viz., in the decaying wood of stables and outhouses. Neverthe 
less it is unknown west of the Alleghanies. The well-known 
Anthrenus scrophularice is common on the Pacific coast, where 
it has probably been introduced from Asia ; but no complaint has 
ever been made of injuries committed by the beetle in California 
and Oregon. It was recently reintroduced from Europe into the 
State of New York or Massachusetts, and proceeded at once to 
destroy, at an alarming rate, the carpets in our houses and stores. 
A very common European dung-beetle, Aphodius lividus, has 
long since found its way to the West Indies, thence to South 
America, and also to our Southern States. Instead of continuing 
its spread northward along the Atlantic coast, it went westward 
through the Gulf States to Texas and Arizona and then north- 

o 

ward through California to Oregon. 

There has never been any serious attempt made properly to col 
lect and record the merely imported species. In fact, such collec 
tion could only be made by the co-operation of many Coleopte- 
rists who live in our great seaports and who would be willing and 
able to spend much time on this work. Mr. Lugger is, so far as 
I know, the only entomologist who has paid some attention thereto 
and who has in his cabinet a good collection of Coleoptera im 
ported in Baltimore, mostly, however, South American species, 
which, of course, have no chance of getting acclimatized in North 
America. A good, though isolated, effort in this direction was 
made in 1876, when a committee, consisting of Drs. Horn, Le- 
Conte, and Leidy, prepared and published a report on insects im 
ported at the Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia. Dr. C. V. 
Riley published independently another report on the same sub 
ject, but the list of imported 'species which were discovered on 
that occasion is not a large one, and I venture to say that an equal 
number of species could be found in the cargo of any steamer ar 
riving at our ports.

From the multitude of introduced species the cosmopolitan 
Coleoptera can be isolated as a tolerably well circumscribed group. 
Owing to the increased facility for obtaining and comparing speci 
mens of the various faunal regions our knowledge of these cosmo 
politan species has in recent years been greatly advanced. Among 
them the coprophagous Staphylinidce, various families of Clavi- 
corn beetles (notably Cucujidce, Cryptophagidce, and Lathri- 
diidce}, and the Ptinidce predominate over all others. The Car- 
abidcE&ve represented by two species, and the large phytophagous 
families, viz., the phytophagous Scarabceidce, Buprestidce, 
Rlateridcc (if these may be called phytophagous Coleoptera), 
Cerainbycidce, and Chrysomelidcz are absent, only the Bruchidce 
and Rhynchophora being represented by a few species. The 
Palaearctic fauna furnished, no doubt, a large proportion of the 
cosmopolitan species. Other species may be assigned, with more 
or less probability, to the faunal regions, while the origin of some 
remains uncertain. 

The remaining portion of the introduced species I have in vain 
attempted to arrange in various groups. I tried to arrange them 
according to the probable method of introduction > with do 
mestic animals, with hay, straw, layers or cuttings of living plants, 
and other articles of commerce, etc. ; but here I had to make so 
many divisions and subdivisions and so many species remained 
unprovided for that I had to abandon my scheme. I also at 
tempted to arrange them according to the probable place of im 
portation from which they had spread over a larger or smaller 
area ; but while quite a number of species can clearly be assigned 
to certain ports, it was found that in many species, and more es 
pecially those which are now widely distributed, the original place 
of importation could no longer be ascertained.*

NOTE ON THE HAIRY EYES OF SOME HYMENOPTERA. 

BY L. O HOWAKD. 

Presence of hairs on the eyes of Hymenopterous insects, and indeed of 
insects of other Orders, has been seldom noticed in general works. Recent 
papers on the compound eye by Lowne, Graber, Greinacher, Mark, and 
others make no mention of these hairs. Siebold (Anatomy of the Inver- 
tebrata) says: "With some Hymenoptera and Diptera they are pilose, 
the hairs being inserted at the angles of the facets." The instances given 
in the foot-note are Apis, Tabanus, Ant homy ia, Rristalis, Volucella, and 
other Diptera. 

Burmeister says, after Jo h. Mailer: "Upon the superior surface we 
occasionally observe, particularly with bees and flies, fine hairs projecting, 
which may be considered as analogous to the eyelashes, as they doubtless 
prevent the approach of external bodies, but at the same time limit the 
visual circle of each facet to the space itself occupies." 

Lashes, or so-called " hairy " eyes, occur with Lepidoptera and with 
certain Coleoptera. In case of the Coleopterous genus Xenos the facets 
are subpentangular, and are separated by narrow spaces filled with dense 
minute ciliae. 

With the Hymenoptera these hairy eyes do not seem to occur with the 
horn-tails, saw-flies, or any of the wasps, nor with the true ants, Mutil- 
lidae or Chrysididse. With true bees, however, they occur in Apis and 
Ccelioxys. Among the Crabronidae they are found in the genus Ento- 

ing here Mr. Fauvel's arrangement of this material, and it will be seen that 
he approaches the subject from a standpoint somewhat differing from that 
taken by the writer of this address :

mognathus. With the parasitic Hymenoptera they are comparatively 
abundant. They are recorded among the Ichneumonidce, in Trichomma, 
and Cymodusa ; among the Braconidse in Chaenusa and Chorebus ; among 
Chalcididie in Brasema, Lutnes, Aseirba, Cleonymus, Mtcradelus, Isocyr- 
tus, Halizous, and Trichoglenes ; among the Proctotrupidse in a number of 
genera, among which may be mentioned Oxylabis. Belyta, Synacra, Pan- 
tolyta, Zygota, Aclista, Acropiesta, Anectata, Pantoclis, Macrohynnis* 
Xcnotoma, Leptorhaptus, and Cinetus. 

Recent examination of other genera shows that these hairy eyes are 
much more abundant than has been heretofore noticed. In the common 
honey bee the hairs are plainly visible to the naked eye. They are fine, 
silky, yellowish in color, very closely set, but not interfering with a 
direct view of the facets, and do not occur at every angle. Some of the 
hairs are o.2 mm long. \nMelissodcs I have been able to observe them, 
although they are very short and fine and barely perceptible with a one- 
quarter-inch lens. Among the Encyrtinse I have found them in some 
species of Encyrtus and in all species of Copidosoma examined. I have 
also found them in the Entedonid genus Chrysocharis, and in the Scelionid 
genus Telenomus. All of the species of the genus Coccophagus which I 
have described have hairy eyes, the hairs plainly seen under 140 diam 
eters. 

None of theyellotv species ofApkelfntts have these eyes, but the only black 
species A. malt has the hairs as plainly as in Coccophagus, although 
in antennal structure and wing characters it plainly belongs to the 
former genus. In all ot these Chalcids there is no question of degree of 
hairiness, for in the smallest species of Coccophagus the hairs can be seen 
quite plainly with a power of 55 diameters, becoming more and more dis 
tinct, with higher powers, until at 140 diameters they are very distinct. 
With the non-hairy-eyed species, however, a power of 700 diameters fails 
to show any but a plain surface. As nearly as can be seen in these smaller 
Chalcids the hairs are situated one at each angle of a facet. Their length 
in Coccophagus californicus is .oo57 mm . 

From the intimate connection of these hairs with so important an organ 
as that of sight it would seem at first glance that their presence or absence 
should form an important classificational character ; but after a careful 
review of the ground, and taking into consideration that they occur in 
almost isolated genera scattered through different families, and not related 
in habits in any way, we must come to the conclusion that they are func- 
tionless or of slight use to the species, and probably of no more value as 
classificatory characters than pilose growths upon any other part of the 
epidermis. 

Mr. Smith said that among the Lepidoptera three variations 
were found in the eyes, viz., the naked, the lashed, and the hairy. 
The term " lashed" was used when the eyes had a fringe of hair 
around the margin. The question of having hairy or naked eyes 



OF WASHINGTON. 197 

was not one of degree. The eyes were always either distinctly 
hairy or naked. In the Noctuida this was used as a generic 
character. 

Prof. Riley agreed with Mr. Howard. He did not think that 
this variation can be used as a generic character, and even ques 
tioned its specific importance. 

Mr. vSmith said that it was always of generic value in Lepidop- 
tera. 

Mr. Schwarz said that in Coleoptera this character occurred in 
various families and had always specific value. 

Prof. Riley stated that, so far as known, there were no species 
of Hemiptera that had hairy eyes. He asked if this character had 
ever been used alone. 

Mr. Smith replied that it had been so used in Noctuidcc. 

Mr. Schwarz asked if there was not in other Orders some cor 
relation between the granulation of the eyes and their being hairy 
or naked. Were not the coarsely granulated eyes always naked 
and only the finely granulated ones sometimes hairy?

NOTES ON BUMBLE-BEES.* 

BY FREDERICK V. COVILLH, Assistant Botanist, U. S. Department of Agriculture. 

In the summer of 1885 tne writer was a member of the Summer School 
of Entomology of Cornell University, under the direction of Professor J. 
H. Comstock ; and a portion of the work selected by him and assigned to 
him was a series of observations upon the bumble-bees of the vicinity of 
Ithaca, N. Y. Specimens were collected, determined, an analytical key 
to the species prepared, a series of notes made upon their specific charac 
ters, methods of capture and rearing devised and carried out, and their 
habits studied. At the end of the season a mass of more or less hetero 
geneous notes had accumulated containing several new and interesting 
facts, but not in condition for publication without additional work. The 
writer hoped thatwithin afewyears at most an opportunity of completing 
his observations and publishing an entire account of them would be pre 
sented ; but as the course of events has rendered this impossible, and for 
the future improbable, the original plan of publication must be given up 
and only a few of the seemingly more important facts published.

I. 
THE HABITS OF BUMBLE-BEES. 

It was found impracticable to find the nests of the bees by the method of 
" lining" used in the case of the honej-bees. It was difficult to get the 
bees to feed in a box. When liberated they did not fly in straight lines, 
and never did one return. It may aid some future student, however, if it 
is stated here that the writer has frequently seen bees when laden fly from 
a field of clover in a straight line in the direction of a nest, the location of 
which he already knew. 

The neighboring farmers usually knew the localities of several nests, 
and were glad enough to point them out. Just before dark, after all the 
bees were in, the writer, provided with a cigar box, a bottle of chloroform, 
a pair of forceps, and a gauze-covered wide-mouthed bottle, would quietly 
approach the nest, pour a little chloroform over it, wait until the hum 
ming had ceased, open the top of the nest, pick out the bees with the 
forceps and put them in the bottle, the nest, with the " comb," being 
placed in the cigar-box. The bees soon revive, and the chloroform, if 
used moderately, does not kill the larvae. 

A box about three inches deep and large enough to contain the nest had 
been previously provided with a glass cover, and a small hole had been 
cut in the side. In this box the nest and revived bees were placed, and the 
aperture closed for a day. The box was then fitted in below a window sash, 
so that the bees could come and go on the outside without annoying the 
observer. The nest, if a thin one, was blocked up, so that the uppermost 
cells of the "comb" touched the glass, and the whole box covered with 
an opaque mat. The nest, originally that of a mouse, was made of dead 
grass and lined with wax, and as there was little room between the comb 
and the glass, the upper part of the nest could not be rebuilt, and the wax 
lining was made fast on all sides to the glass. Thus, when the darkening 
mat was removed, the whole interior of the nest could be seen. The bees 
entered the nest through an opening near the bottom. They soon became 
reconciled to their new quarters, although for a few days many of them 
would return to the place from which their nest had been taken. It was 
not ascertained whether these bees perished or learned afterward the new 
location of the nest. 

All the nests that were reared were captured in July, and the one on 
which the following observations were made was that of a colony of Bom- 
bus borealis. 

A general account of the habits of some of our American bumble-bees 
was published by F. W. Putnam* many years ago, and the observations 
there recorded agree, so far as they go, with the few exceptions noted be 
low, with those of the writer, and some additional facts are here presented, 

*Proc. Essex Institute, iv, 98-104 (1864-5). 



OF WASHINGTON. 199 

with a sufficient number of well-known facts to give them intelligible con 
nection. 

The nest contained when captured the queen and a large number of 
workers of various sizes, as well as eggs, and larvae in various stages of 
development The precise functions of the different-sized workers were 
not evident, but in general the larger ones attended to the mending of 
the grass covering of the nest and to the bringing in of honey, while the 
smaller ones for the most part did the inside " house-work," the wax 
patching, and the nursing, described below. The nursing, indeed, was 
never done, so far as was observed, by a large or even a medium-sized bee. 

The eggs are laid, several together,* in cavities in a mass of wax. This 
is in direct opposition to the statements of Putnam (1. c.), and of various 
English writers consulted by me, they stating that the eggs are laid in 
a mass of pollen, upon which the larvae, when hatched, feed. The sub 
stance was tested first by the application of 1 eat, when it melted pre 
cisely like beeswax. It would not dissolve in water, while pollen and an 
artificial mixture of pollen and honey readily did so. A microscopic ex 
amination of the wax showed, however, that it contained a great number 
of pollen grains; but this would be expected when it is considered how 
much pollen is used about the nest. The larvae, after hatching, remain 
incased in a shell of wax, and soon become separated by a wall of the same 
substance each from its neighbor. 

Their method of obtaining nourishment instead of by eating away the 
pollen walls, in which they are supposed to be incased, the workers con 
stantly adding more to the outside is strikingly different. Thev are fed 
by a mixture of pollen and honey supplied to them by a worker. The op 
eration will be described later. 

The larvae, when grown, spin a silken cocoon, and at the end of the 
nymphal stage, the duration of which was unfortunately not noted, f emerge 
by gnawing about the apex of the cocoon so as to form a lid. When the 
adults first come out their subsequently yellow hairs are pale, almost white. 
As soon as the bee has left its nymphal quarters the other workers cut 
away about the upper half of the cell and remove the debris. The part 
which is left furnishes a receptacle for the raw honey and pollen as it is 
brought into the nest. 

When returning from the field the bees settled down upon the alighting- 
block at the entrance of their box, when full laden, with a low, abruptly- 
ceasing hum, always distinguishable from that of a bee without honey or 
pollen. The bees went directly, in a most business-like way, to the pots, 
deposited their loads, and went atvay again or busied themselves about the 
nest. If honey-laden, the bee perched herself on the margin of a honey- 

*The writer has observed in B. vagans as few as three and in B. terri- 
cola as many as twenty. 

f The writer estimates this time, from memory, at from two to three 
weeks. 



200 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

pot, lowered her head into it, and then drew her abdomen far in, thus 
forcing the honey from her mouth. If pollen-laden, the bee balanced 
herself, with her middle and cephalic pairs of legs, on the edge of a pol 
len-pot, head outward, spread her wings, and then scraped the pollen- 
masses from her corbiculae by rubbing the posterior legs together. 

The mode of feeding the larvae is as follows. One of the smaller work 
ers, which may be called a nurse-bee, goes to a honey-pot, from which she 
presumably draws a small amount of honey, and proceeds next to a pollen- 
pot. She remains here, with her head in the pot, undoubtedly preparing 
a mixture of pollen and honey, for ordinarily about ten minutes. Then 
going to one of the larvae, which lie in circular form in their chambers, 
she injects into the cell, through a small opening previously made, usu 
ally by another worker, a brownish fluid of the consistency of honey. 
This is greedily eaten by the larva. Whether the larvae of both females 
and workers are fed in the same manner and with the same mixture could 
not be decided. But, from the analogous case of the honey-bee, it is to be 
expected that the kind of food does influence the size and function of the 
bee. The males, it may be added, are commonly supposed to have come 
from eggs laid by the sterile females (workers). 

In eaidy August females (queens) and males began to emerge. Both left 
the nest within a few days, and did not return, nor were they seen to cop 
ulate. 

In the first chilly afternoon of autumn the workers become stiffened with 
cold, and do not return ; and after a few freezing days the old queen, too, 
succumbs. The males also perish, and only the young queens survive the 
winter. 

The bees were greatly troubled with inquilines. In the grass covering 
of the nest there were always present the larva of a small moth, a small 
beetle, in its various stages, and frequently cockroaches. Within the wax 
lining a minute insect was frequently seen.* The larvae of the bees were, 
too, sometimes killed by what was probably a fungus of the genus Rnto- 
mophthora. These dead larvae were always carried out by the bees and 
dropped. 

The bees were very cleanly in their habits. Their faeces, for example, 
were always deposited in a particular place outside the nest, in a corner of 
the box. The bee approached the spot, turned about so as to face away 
from it, then backed still nearer, and forciby ejected the faeces. 

II. 
THE TRUE RELATIONSHIP OF THE SO-CALLED APATHUS ELATUS. 

When the colony of bees on which most of the preceding observations 
were made was captured, the species was supposed to be Bombus fervidus; 
and as it is of this species that A-patJms elatus is supposed to be an inqui- 



* None of these inquilines were determined. 



OF WASHINGTON. 201 

line, a careful watch was kept to detect, if possible, the breeding of the in- 
quiline. But all the bees that emerged were either workers, queens, or 
drones. No Apathus was developed. It was noticed, however, that the 
workers and queens differed somewhat from others collected in the field, 
and a reconsideration of the characters of the two forms showed that the 
colony in captivity was not B. fervidus, but B. borealis a species previ 
ously overlooked by the writer, but well described (the female only, how 
ever), and distinguished by Kirby.* All the 9 ? an ^ of these 
two species in the collection were accordingly easily separated, but among 
the rf c? only one form could be found that with precisely the coloration 
of B. borealis, and identical with those bred from the captive colony of 
that species. Not a r^ specimen was found that showed any probability 
of belonging to B. fervidus. 

Meanwhile two bumble-bees had been captured in copulation by Mr. 
O. E. Pearce.t These were examined, and proved to be a 9 Bombus fer 
vidus and a Apathus elalus ! 

An examination of the structural characters of A. elatus with a view to 
ward finding therein the warrant for placing the species in Apathus in 
stead of Bombus was. next made. The males of Apathus are said to differ 
from those of Bombus by having the outer side of the tibia of the poste 
rior leg rounded and covered with hair, and by having no corbicula. 
Bombus has a flat naked tibia and a corbicula. Apatkus elatus has, it is 
found, a corbicula, rudimentary it is true, and the hairs on the outer sur 
face of the tibia are shorter and scantier than in any other species of 
Apathus. So far as these structures are concerned, therefore, A. elatus, 
while apparently clearly an Apatkus, is really intermediate between the 
two genera. 

Next, several colonies of genuine B. fervidus were taken, in the autumn 
of 1886, at the season of producing males, and in every case the so-called 
A. elatus emerged from the nymph'-cells in abundance, and no other form. 

A female A. elatus has never been described. 

The writer, therefore, considers Apatkus elatus to be the male of Bom 
bus fervidus, the evidence being summed up as follows : The female of 
Apathus elatus is unknown. The male of Bombus fervidus is unknown. 
The coloring of the two is alike. The structural characters of A. elatus do 
not unequivocally keep it out of Bombus. A. elatus has been bred in colo 
nies of B. fervidus, and in the colonies of no other species. No male bee, 

*In B. fervidus the hairs of the head are entirely black, and those of the 
pleura yellow. In B. borealis the hairs of the head, on the vertex and on 
the face cephalad of the antennae, and sometimes caudad of the antennae, 
are partly yellow, and those of the pleura black. The yellow hairs of B. 
borealis on all parts of the body have a tawny shade, quite different from 
the lemon-yellow of B. fervidus. 

fA similar case has been recorded by Mr. Benjamin D. Walsh (Proc. 
Ent. Soc. Phil., iii, 247, foot-note [1864] ). 



202 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

i 

except A. elatus, has been bred in colonies of B. fervidus. A. elatus and 
B. fervidus have been taken in copulation. 

One additional case, in connection with this matter, needs to be inquired 
into. Mr. E. T. Cresson records* the taking, in the State of New Jersey, 
of a colony of B. pennsylvanicus, which contained six females, thirty-four 
workers, and twenty-one males of "A. elatus" Mr. C. L. Marlatt has 
frequently collected these males in Kansas, which were doubtfully so 
determined by Mr. Cresson, in the nests of the same species. It is to be 
remarked that in these instances males of B. fiennsylvanicus are never 
found. It has been impossible for the writer to give these specimens of 
so-called A, elatus a critical examination. But he is confident that they 
will be found to differ from the A. elatus referred to B. fervidus, and to 
be the males of the species with which they are found. f 

There remain four North American species of true Apathus, two of which 
the males only are described, and two of which females only are known, 
and which respectively resemble the other species in coloration. Their 
breeding habits are entirely unknown. 

Prof. Riley opened the discussion, saying that he did not doubt 
the accuracy of the above conclusions in the least. He had found 
great difficulty in separating the species in these two genera. 

Mr. Marlatt stated that he had examined the nest of Bombus 
pennsylvanicus in the fall and had found the workers and queens, 
also male specimens, which were doubtfully identified as Apathus 
elatus, but which he now considers must have been the males of 
B. pennsylvanicus. In other species of Bombus he had found 
the males abundant. 

Mr. Ashmead would hardly be willing to accept these conclu 
sions as final until the insects had been reared from the egg. 

Mr. Schwarz stated that he had seen the male of B. pennsyl 
vanicus, and that Mr. Pergande had called his attention to the 
difference in flight in the two sexes of this species. 

Prof. Riley said that he now recalled having taken a female 
Bombus and male Apathus in copulation. 

Mr. Coville further stated, in answer to a question, that there 
were a number of queens hatched together, and that they all left

the nest at the same time, leaving the old queen in possession. 
The young queens did not start colonies until the following 
spring. 

Mr. Ashmead offered some remarks on the genus Tetracnemus. 
He called attention to the fact that Westwood first described a 
species with five tarsal joints. Then Walker described one with 
only four, considering the five of Westwood a mistake. Mr. Ash- 
mead showed specimens of two distinct genera, both agreeing 
nearly with Westwood's description, but the one with four, the 
other with five, tarsal joints, showing that Westwood was right in 
placing his genera in the Encyrtince, while the form described by 
Walker belongs to the Eulophince. He collected both in Florida.

THE JIGGER FLEA OF FLORIDA. 
BY LAWRENCE C, JOHNSON. 

Probably our fair land of orange groves and alligators possesses as many 
varieties of the flea family as any other in the same latitude, but one of 
them seems to be peculiar. The " Crackers "as the native-born English- 
speaking folks are called know it by the name of the "jigger flea," which 
is a translation, or, strictly speaking, a transference, of the local colonial 
Spanish title, the " Chigo flea," which means, it seems, that to the popu 
lar understanding it is not the " Chigo " of the West Indies, nor their old 
acquaintance from Spain, the flea, but something compounded of both. 

Observation of the habits of this insect verify the appropriateness of the 
designation. All its habits all its life-history, are not yet known ; but 
from such as are actually known, a few others maybe inferred.

204 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

Like all fleas, it abounds mostly in shady places; under old houses, on 
earthen floors, and in all dusty, untidy spots. Hence from analogy when 
some years ago my attention was called to the subject by poultry breeders, 
I advised to have all such places closed up, and to deprive their fowls of 
all shade except such places as could be rained upon. Those who acted 
on this advice were rewarded. Losses from this cause were reduced to a 
minimum. It was also seen that animals frequenting wet spots in summer 
were exempt from the pests. 

The life-history of this flea is yet to be written. So far as facts go, they 
are too few and obscure to base satisfactory conclusions upon. 

First observed to infest young animals such as chickens, turkeys, kit 
tens, puppies, and even calves and colts and children I proposed for it 
the name Pulex ptillulorum; but whilst it is true the young suffer most, 
because possibly less able to defend themselves, it is by no means confined 
to them. 

In general appearance, size, color, and form greatly resembling a flea, 
popular observation notices one considerable difference it does not hop. 
Closely examined, we find the femoral portion of the third pair of legs 
but slightly developed. Hence its motions resemble more the crawling of 
a wingless fly than of our well-known active jumper. 

In its habits of feeding it differs /rom the ordinary flea. Instead of mak 
ing an incision at which -to lap blood, and from which it may quickly re 
move to another spot, our Florida variety plants itself where it intends to 
stay, like a tick. As to the males, I cannot say. Much of my information 
is second-hand. The notion that these do not bite, which prevails with 
some persons, or at least that they do not stick, may be an error. Of the 
females, however, it is certain they bury themselves in the skin of their 
victims. From the first, they hold on with such tenacity that no ordinary 
brushing will remove them. It seems to beat this stage in their existence 
that impregnation takes place. The males now are often seen in copula 
with them, and so remain apparently for days, or until the tumefaction of 
the skin excited by the imbedded. female closes around her so as to shove 
him off. 

Here ends about all actually known of this history. 

From analogy, we may infer that, the period of gestation being com 
pleted, the gravid female lays her eggs in this well-prepared nidus, or, more 
particularly, that they remain and are hatched in her distended stomach, 
after which the larvae crawl out and drop to the ground. If in a dry, shady 
spot they undergo transformation to the perfect form ; if in a wet spot or 
in the sun they perish. 

Upon man, I have never heard of the process continuing to the end. The 
itching caused by it generally attracts attention sufficiently to have the in 
truder hunted out. With the lower animals it is different most notedly 
with chickens. Spots bare of feathers, or nearly so, are selected in prefer 
ence. A small knot resembling a wart grows over the insect, and so nu 
merous and large at times as to spread over the eyes and into the jaws ; 



OF WASHINGTON. 205 

and, blind and famished, the victim dies. In cases not fatal, after a month 
or two, these knots or warts drop off, leaving a scar resembling a burn. 
With very young chickens or puppies, death generally comes in the first 
stage, when every portion of their bodies is covered with innumerable 
enemies. 

Mr. Schwarz said that he had only met with the true flea and 
the Chigo (Rhynchoprion penetrans} in Florida, and that he is 
inclined to think that Judge Johnson is dealing with the latter. 
The specimens formerly sent by Judge Johnson were a true 
Pulex. 

Prof. Riley mentioned that the larvae of several mites produce 
an effect as described on chickens, but the true Chigo does not. 

Prof. Riley spoke on some " Microgasters affecting Rhopalo- 
cera." He called attention to the great variability of these spe 
cies, and said that their specific distinction was more or less de 
pendent upon individual opinion, and that this held in relation to 
the cocoons as well as to the images. He stated that it was 
almost as easy to make a continuous series as to make well- 
marked divisions. He also said that M. pieridis Packard was 
the same as Apanteles glomeratus Linn., although the American 
form shows some slight differences from the European in the 
coloration of the legs. Extreme examples are easily separated, 
but there is a perfect series of intergrades. He could firtd no 
entomophagic effects. Different hosts might make some differ 
ence in the cocoons, but not in the imago. There were many 
excellent structural characters that could be used, as the sculpture 
on various parts, that of the scutellum being particularly valuable. 

Dr. Marx remarked that he was glad to find that others had 
found this difficulty in separating species. In spiders it was ex 
ceptionally difficult, as there was much individual variation. 
There was always some slight difference between American and 
European spiders of the same species. 

Mr. Smith said that according to the Darwinian theory many 
of the structural characters must vary. In many groups he has 
had cause to doubt the existence of any species. Many times, 
however, the true characters have been overlooked, and closer 
study will bring out the species. He cited the genus Lachnos- 
terna, which he had recently worked out. He asked if the males 
of Microgaster had not some characters that could be utilized. 



206 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

In several groups of insects only the males could be separated, 
the females being indistinguishable. 

Prof. Riley replied that in Microgaster the females were gen 
erally the better characterized, but in a few it was the males.

The male antennae and the female ovipositor often gave the best 
characters.

SWARMING OF LYCVENA COMYNTAS, GODT. 

BY C. L. MARLATT. 

About the middle of July, 1888, the writer's attention was drawn to the 
large numbers of small butterflies, of the species above named, flitting with 
irregular but rapid flight back and forth at a height of 25 to 30 feet from 
the ground, above some elm trees which grew alongside a large field of 
red clover. Occasionally one would rest for a second or two on the upper 
part of an elm, only to quickly resume its place in the swarming mass 
above. 

No easy explanation of the peculiar congregating of these butterflies pre 
sents itself. So far as observed, it was not a nuptial flight no union of 
the sexes occurring. There was no general movement in any direction, 
but their actions seemed rather of a playful or frolicsome nature. They 
had evidently come together from the clover-field mentioned, in which 
thej r had been breeding abundantly. 

A threatening storm of wind and rain coming on at the time may have 
had something to do with their collecting into swarms. 

An additional instance may be given, which indicates still further a 
semi-gregarious habit with these insects. The writer has observed them 
in later summer covering moist patches of ground in such numbers that a 
single sweep of a net would capture 50 or more of them. Their object in 
this instance was evidently to suck up the moisture, the extremely dry 
weather having doubtless greatly reduced the supply of nectar in the 
clover-blossoms. 

Mr. Smith said that it could hardly be a nuptial flight, for this 
species copulates over its feeding-grounds in the fields. 

Mr. Schwarz said that Benton had lately recorded an instance of 
a " flock" of butterflies in New Guinea, which covered a couple 
of acres of ground where there were no flowers for food. 

Prof. Riley thought this note very interesting, and said that 
whenever, from whatever cause, a species of insect becomes ex 
tremely abundant it almost invariably swarms and has some pe 
culiar flight. He mentioned an instance, which came under his 



OF WASHINGTON. 207 

own notice, of extreme abundance of Colias and Vanessa in 
France. When the food-plant grows scarce a tendency to mi 
grate is generally shown. He has noticed large migrations of 
Anosia plcxippus, leaving Manitoba in the fall and returning in 
the spring. 

Mr. Schwarz suggested that the swarm noticed by Mr. Marlatt 
might correspond to the swarms of gnats which are so often seen. 

Dr. Fox mentioned seeing a large number of the Anosia cross 
ing a large pond northward, early in September. They were 
evidently flying with the wind. 

Prof. Riley mentioned having seen several specimens at the sea- 
coast attempting to fly inland against high winds for many hours 
at a time, with but short rests. 

Mr. Schwarz said that the swarming in Coleoptera always oc 
curred on sultry evenings, and the beetles usually let themselves 
go with the wind. 

As an instance of migratory instinct, Prof. Rilev called attention 
to the spring migration of the earth-worm as showing the same 
trait. 

Mr. Smith mentioned having noticed in an entomological jour 
nal the capture in England of Mamestrq chenopodii, an Ameri 
can variety. He thought this was an error, and that a continental 
variety closely resembling the American form was that to which 
it should be referred.* 

Prof. Riley had seen specimens in the British Museum corre 
sponding to the variety referred to.

It is never too late to mend. It is now nearly 30 years since I published, 
in the above-named volume, a paper : On the North American Cecidomyidae 
(I. c., pp. 172-205); and it is only now that a passage in Fred. A. A. Skuse's : 
Diptera of Australia, Part I, Cecidomyidae (Proc. Lin. Soc. of N. S. Wales, 
Vol. iii, p. 45, Jan. 1888), draws my attention to an egregious blunder 
that I committed on pages 177 and 178 of that volume. Mr. Skuse is right 
of course, and in consequence the three last lines of page 177 should read 
thus: 

The upper branch of the fork forms a single smooth curve; $ antennae

In the discussion of this paper Mr. Schwarz said that he fully 
agreed with a statement by Dr. Sharp, to the effect that the insect 
fauna of the Galapagos Islands was altogether too little known to 
define its character. No expert entomologist had, to his knowl 
edge, ever visited these islands. 

Mr. Mann stated that according to his information one of the 
most distinct lines of demarkation between florae is that which is 
drawn between the florae of the west coast of South America and 
those of the Pacific islands.

NOTES ON THE COMPARATIVE VITALITY OF INSECTS IN COLD WATER. 

BY E. A. SCHWARZ. 

The following fragmentary notes on the vitality of the different orders 
of insects when immersed in cold water are not based upon experimenta-

tion, but upon observation in the field, and require some preliminary ex 
planation regarding the circumstances under which the observations were 
made. 

The occasional accumulation of large masses of insects of all Orders 
washed ashore on the, sandy beaches of our great lakes or along the 
ocean has often been mentioned in print and otherwise; but since, so far 
as I am aware, nothing definite has ever been published concerning this 
phenomenon I take this opportunity to place on record the results of ob 
servations carried on through several years along the Upper Lakes, and 
more especially Lake Superior. To the latter locality I refer more 
especially because here my friends and myself have been at several points 
all around the lake in different years, and also because the insect fauna 
of the Lake Superior region is infinitely richer than that of the Lower 
Lakes. Moreover, in the boreal climate of Lake Superior the appearance of 
the entire insect fauna is a nearly simultaneous one, whereas on the Lower 
Lakes the various species appear successively from early spring through 
out the whole summer. At Lake Superior the time of appearance and 
swarming of most insects is compressed into the short time from the be 
ginning of June till the middle of July. During these few weeks untold 
millions of insects fall into the lake, but whether attracted by the glitter 
ing surface of the water or from exhaustion, having flown too far out into 
the lake, cannot be ascertained. Under certain conditions these speci 
mens are washed upon the beach, reaching the same either alive or 
drowned, and form, on a favorable day, intermixed with the various debris, 
a windrow sometimes several inches in height and width, and continuing 
for miles along the shore until the direction of the beach changes. 

This accumulation of specimens, observed by many entomologists, is 
usually said to occur during or after a storm ; but this is quite incorrect, 
at least so far as the Lake Superior region is concerned. If the lake is 
angry, the waves break long before reaching the shore, the sand is stirred 
up by them, and all insects that are washed ashore are at once buried in 
the sand, whence they are unable to extricate themselves, and where 
they cannot be seen. Only the strongest among them e. g., the genus 
Sphenophorus of the Coleoptera survive the general slaughter. To pro 
duce a large accumulation of specimens on the beach, a gentle but steady 
breeze must prevail, for at least several hours, directly toward the shore, 
and must be preceded by warm weather. If the breeze is offshore, or even 
obliquely toward the shore, or changeable, or if the weather has been cold 
a day or two before, no accumulation of specimens takes place.* Such 
favorable combination of meteorological conditions does not often occur 
at a given place of the lake shore, and one can spend a whole season at the 

*Th. v. Siebold (Beitraege zur Fauna Preussens, 1849, p. 6) refers to 
this phenomenon as observed by him at the Baltic Sea, near Danzig, 
Prussia, after the first days of spring, and states that the insects are washed 
ashore by a light breeze blowing inshore. 



210 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

lake without once witnessing the phenomenon I speak about. If, how 
ever, luck is favorable, the number of species and specimens of all orders 
that can thus be found is simply incredible to any one who has not been 
on the spot himself. It suffices to say here that in 1877 Mr. H. G. Hub- 
bard and myself collected, or rather picked up, within four days, upwards 
of 1,100 species of Coleoptera alone, and this not under quite favorable 
conditions. 

This is of course an excellent opportunity of filling the collecting-boxes 
with large series of the choicest and rarest species ; but this mode of col 
lecting is a most unsatisfactory one, for nothing can be learned regarding 
the food-habits or mode of life, or earlier stages, of all the thousands of 
species-found on the beach. In fact, it is most aggravating to the ento 
mologist to see on the beach hundreds of specimens of a showy species of 
which he is entirely unable to find a single specimen in the woods or 
wherever the species may be supposed to live. 

When during the past year I had again the opportunity of spending a 
few days in July on the south shore of Lake Superior, and of witnessing 
the washing ashore of multitudes of insects, I had the idea that this vast 
mass of material could possibly be utilized to point out, within a reason 
able degree of certainty or probability, the power exhibited by the various 
species of insects of retaining their vitality when immersed in cold water. 
I went to work accordingly and began to note down those species or 
genera which appeared to me to have reached the shore in good/, e., liv 
ing-condition, in contradistinction to those which I found drowned, at 
least as far as the greatest majority of specimens would justify such state 
ment; but very soon I found out that the immense material before me 
was too much for my task, and I had to confine myself to the commonest 
species, which aggregate more than 800 species, distributed most un 
evenly among the various orders. 

At the first glance it would appear that such comparison based upon 
this material was impossible, for we have no means to ascertain how long 
these insects have been immersed in the water. But the following consid 
erations induced me to continue my notes and to complete them after my 
return to Detroit from the collections made in former years at the same 
locality. 

Among the thousands of specimens of a common .species found on the 
beach a certain proportion must have been exposed to the water for a short 
time, another number for a longer period, and still another portion for a 
very long period. If all these specimens, or by far the greatest portion of 
them, reach the shore in living condition, it is evident that we can enu 
merate this species among those that can endure, without injury and for 
a long time, exposure in cold water; and if, on the other hand, all or most 
specimens of another common species are found drowned on the beach, 
we may correctly infer that even those specimens which have been in the 
water for a short period were killed by the immersion, and that we can 
enumerate this species among those which cannot bear a long exposure in 



OF WASHINGTON. 

water. A difficulty is experienced with those species which are about 
equally divided in regard to living and drowned specimens. Here it ap 
pears probable that the living specimens have been in the water for a 
short time and the dead specimens for a longer or very long period. Such 
species naturally occupy an uncertain, or at least intermediate, place on 
my list. 

That all terrestrial or semi-terrestrial, and, I may add, also most of the 
truly aquatic insects in the imago state get finally drowned in water, ad 
mits of no doubt, but how long they are able to sustain immersion can 
only be ascertained by experiment with each species. It is evident, how 
ever, that this time varies according to -the adaptability of the species and 
to a multitude of circumstances, such as temperature and condition of the 
water. If insects happen to cling to pieces of wood or other floating ob 
jects they will be able to sustain the exposure much longer than those 
which simply float on the surface of the water. Insects with exposed 
stigmata are evidently less fit for long immersion than those with pro 
tected stigmata, and those with a nervous temperament and which exhaust 
themselves by violent movements succumb, no doubt, sooner than those 
with a more phlegmatic temperament. Among the Lake Superior insects 
washed ashore we notice many strictly nocturnal species, and if these are 
washed ashore, say, at noon of a certain day, it is evident that they must 
have been in the water at least since the previous night, and probably since 
the earlier hours of that night, since most nocturnal insects fly soon after 
dark and not often after midnight. But we have no means of ascertaining 
whether such insects have been in the water for one day or two, or even 
longer. With the diurnal insects this uncertainty is still greater. The 
washed-up specimens may have been only a few minutes in the water, or 
for some hours, or for one or two days, or still longer. That there is a 
great diversity in this respect is evident from the immense multitude of 
specimens found on a single point. They cannot have possibly dropped 
in the water at a single spot and at the same time. Some, no doubt, 
dropped into the lake a short distance from the shore; some farther out, 
and still others very far perhaps many miles from the shore. In the 
summer of 1874, Mr. H. G. Hubbard and myself passed on a raft of logs 
through Lake Sinclair. This raft was more than a hundred feet wide 
jn front, and it acted like a great collecting machine, fishing up every 
thing that came in its way. The raft was covered with specimens of all 
Orders, and this happened at a distance of at least five miles from the near 
est land. How long it would take these insects to be driven ashore by a 
favorable breeze is not possible to tell without special observation ; but 
from what we saw at Lake Superior this process is accomplished more rap 
idly than one is inclined to suppose. 

With all these drawbacks and uncertainties I present herewith, for what 
it is worth, the following table of Orders, condensed from my notes and 
arranged according to their smaller or greater ability to withstand immer 
sion in the icy water of Lake Superior. If this table should be arranged 



212 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

according to single families the same sequence of Orders could not be 
maintained, .since even among those Orders lowest on my scale we find 
families which are well adapted to stand the exposure : 

ist Group Insects ill fitted to stand immersion : 

Dtptera, Neuroptera. 

2d Group Orders that occupy an intermediate place, arranged in 
an ascending series from those that are less to those 
that are better able to withstand immersion : 
Orthoptera, Hemiptera, Lepidoptera. 

3d Group Orders that are eminently fitted to endure immersion : 
Hymenoptera, Coleoptera. 

DIPTERA. These are rather poorly represented among the insects 
washed ashore. There are not many Tipulidcz, and among them a still 
living specimen is rarely to be seen. There are numerous Muscidce, 
Syrphidce, Asilidce, Conopidce, Anthracidce, and Bombyliidce, but' few liv_ 
ing specimens among them. A notable exception is found in the Bibi- 
onidce, which, as a rule, are found in excellent condition. In this Order, 
as well as in the others, we meet also with another striking phenomenon, 
viz., there are lots of the most delicate forms, e. g., Cecidomyidce, Sctaridce, 
MycetophilidcE, being washed ashore unharmed; whereas the larger and 
more robust species are apparently much less capable of enduring immer 
sion. But this may be explained in the following way : First, small and deli 
cate insects are poorer flyers than larger insects. This does of course not im 
ply that all large insects are good flyers, but only means that the best flyers 
are to be found only among the large forms. These delicate Diptera cer 
tainly fly only a short distance out into the lake, and have then a good 
chance of being driven ashore within a short time. Moreover, they are so 
light that when they drop in the water they are but little immersed, and 
are then washed ashore dry and unharmed. Second, while it is easy to 
see living and moving specimens of even very small insects, the eye of the 
observer is not attracted to the dead specimens which cling to the various 
objects e.g., pieces of bark, other insects, etc. 

The absence of Black-flies (Simttliidce) among the insects found on the 
beach is also noticeable. These abound near the woods, as is only too well 
known to the visitors of that region, and breed in the numerous rivers and 
creeks some distance from the lake where the water is still rapid. They 
often fly great distances from the breeding places, but dislike to come near 
the open shore, and do not allow themselves to be driven by the wind out 
into the lake. 

NEUROPTERA (including PSEUDONEUROPTERA). Although for the larg 
est portion water-born, these insects are ill-fitted to sustain, in the imago 
state, immersion in water, and the remarkable thing is that those families 
which are terrestrial in the earlier stages seem to have a superior resisting 
power. Thus among the Psoctdte and Hemerobiidoe, which are numer 
ously represented, the greater portion of the specimens washed ashore are

alive and in very good state of preservation, while in the Perlidce and 
Ephemcrida* most specimens are found drowned. In the Odonata, which 
are well represented in the Lake Superior region, it is difficult to find living 
specimens on the beach except in the family Agrionidce. These are gener 
ally alive and in good condition, owing no doubt to the fact that they are 
poor flyers, and have not been long exposed to the water. The remaining 
families of Odonata are among the best flyers. They fly for many miles 
out over the water, and many are no doubt able to fly across the lake at 
its widest part. But many specimens fall into the water, and are finally 
driven ashore in a badly decayed condition, thus showing that they must 
have been in the water for a long time, but even among those not decayed 
it is hard to find a living specimen. The Trichoptera are by far the most 
numerous insects in the Lake Superior region, and they are also best rep 
resented among the insects cast ashore, constituting about one-half of the 
whole mass. On account of this multitude of specimens, it becomes a 
difficult thing to estimate the proportion of the living to the dead speci 
mens. There are millions of dead specimens, decayed or not decayed, 
millions of half-dead specimens, and other millions which are in excellent 
condition and as lively as ever. 

ORTHOPTERA. These can hardly be taken into consideration here, since 
they are so poorly represented among the insects on the beach. All I found 
were a few specimens of a Locustid (Mtcrocentrus}, which were alive and 
in excellent condition, and a few species of Acridiidce (Caloptenus bivit- 
tatus, atlanis, femur-rubrum, and perhaps two other species); but these 
in great number of specimens, and here the living specimens by far out 
numbered the drowned specimens. 

HEMIPTERA. These offer but little occasion for remarks. As a whole, 
they are well represented on the beach and tolerably well fitted to sustain 
immersion. Of the Gymnocerata only a few specimens of Corymelcena 
were found, all drowned. The Pentatomidce and Capsidw are the best rep 
resented families, the latter in most cases alive, in spite of their delicate 
appearance and soft covering. Among the Pentatomidce more drowned 
specimens are met with than one should expect. Co re idee and Reduviidce 
are not well represented, and many specimens are dead. Saldid&are com 
mon on the beach and as lively as ever, but probably most of them have 
not been washed up by the waves. Tingitidce abound in specimens, though 
representing only a few species, and are in excellent condition. Of the 
aquatic families, occasionally a specimen is brought in by the waves, al 
ways in living condition. Of the Homoptera, numerous Cicadas (two 
species) were found, all of them dead. The smaller Leaf-hoppers occur in 
enormous number of specimens (but not many species), most of them 
alive. Psyllidce, Aleurodtdce, and winged Coccidce were not seen. Apki- 
didce are there in large number, and more especially certain Pemphigince, 
and of these the same may be said as of the small Diptera, viz., the living 
specimens are easily seen, but the drowned overlooked. 

LEPIDOPTERA. I was surprised that whatever species are washed ashore

these are, in the average, in much better condition than one would sup 
pose. The most striking feature in this Order is the complete absence of 
Rhopalocera and Sphingidce, which both abound in the Lake Superior 
region in specimens, but which are, no doubt, altogether too good flyers 
to be caught by the lake. Some Sesiidce are found on the beach, mostly 
dead and badly decayed. Bombyctdce and Noctuidce are well represented 
in species and specimens, and most of them alive and in good condition, 
except that many Noctuidce are minus the abdomen. I presume this is 
bitten oif by the minnows. Tortricidce, Pyralidce, and Tineidce are not 
very numerous, and most specimens found on the beach are badly used up, 
though still living. However, if the specimens are fished up from the sur 
face of the water they are found to be in an excellent state of preservation. 
The trouble with these delicate Lepidoptera is that when the waves cast 
them ashore they get entangled with their wings among the wet mass of 
other insects and other objects, whence they cannot free themselves. 

HYMENOPTERA AND COLEOPTERA. Very little remains to be said con 
cerning these two Orders. Both can sustain immersion much better than 
the other insects, although, of course, drowned specimens of almost every 
species are met with. Both are extremely well represented in most fami 
lies, and if any one is desirous of making a collection of these Orders the 
sandy beaches of Lake Superior in the early part of July are the best col 
lecting-ground. In Hymenoptera the Tenthredinidce predominate in spe 
cies and specimens. Uroceridce are also numerous. The Apidce are the 
only family in which many drowned specimens can be found, especially in 
Bombus and other very hairy genera. The families Ichneumonidce, Bra- 
conid(E, and Chalcididce are very well represented and in good condition. 
Male specimens of Mtitillidce were not observed. Ants are but poorly 
represented, but the winged specimens of a few species are exceedingly 
abundant on certain days. There are many dead specimens among them, 
but the majority are alive. 

The Coleoptera have the stigmata better protected than any other Order, 
and, for this reason, are best fitted to withstand immersion. They are ex 
tremely well represented on the beach, and of all families occurring in the 
Lake Superior region there are only two which are not washed ashore, 
viz., the Cicindelidce and Gyrinidce. The former abound on the sand of 
the beach, but it seems that they never fly into the lake, nor did I ever 
succeed in driving them into the water. The Gyrinidce are the only Col- 
eoptera which inhabit the open lake. Their home is on the surface of the 
water, but even in the heaviest storm they do not allow themselves to be 
cast ashore by the waves. Dytiscidce are very numerous among the washed- 
up insects, and it seems strange that we find here also drowned specimens. 
It must be remembered, however, that they do not live in the open lake, 
and when they are in the water far from the shore they cannot rest, and 
seem to be unable to renew the supply of air necessary for respiration . Among 
the Chrysomelidce the nearly subaquatic genus Donacia abounds on the 
beach in species and specimens. They are always washed ashcre in per-

feet condition, which is not remarkable, since they are the only ones among 
the Coleoptera in fact, among all insects of any considerable size which 
are not immersed in the water. They ride on the surface of the water with 
outspread legs, and they are also the only Coleoptera, excepting the Gyri- 
nidce, which, in my experience, are able to take wing directly from the sur 
face of the water. 

Mr. Howard agreed with Mr. Schwarz in the idea that the 
structure and covering of the stigmata have a great deal to do 
with their relative power to withstand the water. He also called 
attention to the fact that those insects that passed the larval state 
in the water were among the easiest to drown in the imago. 

Dr. Marx thought that the presence or absence of hairs around 
the stigmata was of great importance in this connection. In the 
aquatic spiders the stigmata are protected by a thick pubescence. 
He also described their process of spinning under water. 

Mr. Schwarz said, in answer to a question of what became of 
these insects after being washed ashore, that those that were dead 
were soon covered by the sand, and that there were two results 
among the living. Those that tried to crawl away over the sands 
were invariably killed by the hot dry sand before going very far, 
butxthat those that could fly away generally reached the woods in 
safety. 

Mr. Howard said that in Ireland the cut-worm that was so de 
structive to linen when laid on the ground had been found to be 
able to withstand immersion in a weak solution of chloride of lime 
for a whole day. 

Mr. Mann said that in the Neuroptera the bodies were so frail 
that they would readily take up water. He thought, however, 
that many of the insects washed ashore were only in a state of 
suspended animation, and that they would ultimately revive, and 
called attention to the case of a fly reported.by Dr. Franklin, which 
was said to have travelled from Virginia to London immersed in a 
bottle of wine and then to have moved ! 

Dr: Fox stated that among some of the Neuroptera the habit of 
immersing themselves in water for a number of minutes was com 
mon when the female wishes to lay her eggs.

AN INGENIOUS METHOD OF COLLECTING BOMBUS AND APATHUS. 

BY C. L. MARLATT. 

Some years ago, while living on a Kansas farm, the writer, in company 
with neighbor boys, was in the habit (reprehensible it now seems) of 
robbing the nests of wild bees, Bombus sp., which were always found 
abundantly during the haying season in the early fall. We were led to do 
this more from the excitement caused by the danger of being stung than 
to secure the honey, which, in fact, is not only rank and unpalatable, but 
at this season of the year very little in quantity. 

The method usually followed was to take a one or two gallon jug, such 
as is commonly used to carry water to hay-makers, fill it partly with water, 
and place it, with cork removed, within two or three feet of the nest. The 
bees were then thoroughly aroused by beating the nest, immediately after 
which the operator, it is needless to add, removed himself hurriedly to a 
safe distance. The enraged bees would swarm out and begin flying about 
in widening circles to discover the enemy. The jug would at once attract 
their attention, and numbers would fly about it and over its open mouth, 
which, by reason of the air set in motion by their wings, would give an 
answering roar to their angry humming. Excited beyond measure by this 
noise, the bees would fly at the mouth of the jug, and one after another 
would pop into it the noise produced by those within still further attract 
ing those without until all had entered. A second disturbance of the nest 
would serve, to draw out and dispose of any of the remaining fighting 
worker-bees, after which the robbing of the nest was easy, as it would still 
contain only young bees, drones, the sluggish winter females, and Apa- 
thus sp. 

After robbing the nest, the water and bees in the jug were emptied on the 
ground, and the bees, though apparently drowned, would soon recover. 

Later, when interested in the collection and study of insects, the method 
outlined above was employed with unvarying success in the examination 
of Bombus nests, particularly for Apathus sp., and also for Coleoptera, 
Diptera, and moths. 

The ordinary use of such water-jugs in hay-fields affords an easy ex 
planation of the discovery of this method of trapping bees. It is a common 
custom of farmers to " stamp out" the nests of wild bees to prevent their 
attacking teams, and we have only to suppose a jug placed over a nest and an 
unsuccessful attempt made to stamp it out, and the discovery of the curious 
attraction of a jug for angry bees is accounted for.

NOTE ON THE MOUTH-PARTS OF THE AMERICAN COCKROACH. 

BY L. O. HOWARD. 

The cockroach is a very cleanly insect, though living in dirty places. 
Any one who watches it carefully under favorable circumstances cannot 
fail to be interested in observing the industrious manner in which it cleans 



OF WASHINGTON. 217 

its limbs, thoroughly mouthing first one tibia and tarsus and then another, 
then stretching out one front leg over an antenna and drawing it between 
its maxillae, gradually passing it forward to the tip. 

For such cleansing work the mouth-parts are well adapted. The tip of 
the labium is slightly bristly and is furnished with a groove, into which the 
antenna fits in passing through. The labium is prehensile and fills the 
part of a lip better than any more solidly chitinous labiirm would. It plays 
freely on its clypeal hinge and bends readily on itself, being capable of 
partly rolling, in fact. The mandibles proper, which are very large and 
strong, perform no part in this process. The maxillae are the important 
agents, and the base of their inner lobe the lacinia is fitted with a broad 
cushion, thickly studded with bristles, well fitted to remove all dust par 
ticles from the limb passing between them. The lacinia presents one or 
two very interesting points. It is strong and mandible-like and furnished 
with a strong, acute, sickle-shaped tooth at tip. At the base of this tooth 
is a most peculiarly shaped digitus, differing widely from the correspond 
ing organ in any Coleopterous insect and from any Orthopterous insect, 
the mouth-parts of which I have seen figured, and even from the corre 
sponding part in Blatta orientalis, as figured by Messrs. Miall and Denny 
in their work upon this species. It is straight, bent at tip, and furnished 
on the inner edge near its tip with three equidistant comb-like teeth. The 
galea is narrow at base, but towards tip broadens and rolls laterally on 
itself, making an almost perfect hood, which surrounds the tip of the 
lacinia when not in use. It shows plainly the propriety of its' name. The 
tips of the faraglossce are also cushion-like and furnished with an abun 
dance of soft bristles, and, undoubtedly the antenna, in being drawn 
through the mouth, held in place' by the hooked tips of the lacinia;, is 
brushed below by the paraglossce as w^ell as by the labium, and on the 
sides by the cushioned bases of the lacinice. 

The labium as a. whole is very highly developed, greatly more so than 
in Hymenoptera, Coleoptera, and other mandibulate insects, including 
such Orthoptera as have been figured. As pointed out by Comstock, who 
seems to have studied only this one organ in the cockroach mouth and who 
does not mention the maxillar peculiarities just mentioned, it is bifid quite 
to the mentum.; but, as I have observed by the dissection of an individual 
just killed and not stiff, although the suture through the hard chitine ex 
tends to the ligulo-mental suture the two halves of the ligula cannot be 
separated except at tip, for a short distance on! \ below the paraglossae, a 
strong hypodermal membrane holding them firmly together. The para- 
glossce are very large, articulating with the two halves of the ligula with 
considerable play and fitting closely together at their inner borders when 
at rest. They are stout, broadly oval (seen from below), and furnished with 
many soft bristles. Each bears, moreover, at its inner tip a little articu 
lated bristled knob, which has received no name. At the inner tip of each 
half of the ligula, mesiad of the paraglossae, is another unnamed sclerite, 
triangular in shape and also bristly. The homology between this bifid 



218 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

labium and the maxillae is very plain, providing only that one imagine the 
median suture extending through mentum and submentum. The half of 
the submentum will then homologize with cardo, the half of the mentum 
with stipes, the half of the trunk of the ligula with subgalea, the outer 
portion of the trunk of the ligula with the palpifer, the paraglossa with 
the galea, and the triangular unnamed sclerites, just mentioned, with the 
lacinia, the palpi of the two organs of course homologizing also. 

I have dissected away the hypopharynx also, but fail to see a differen 
tiated epipharynx in this insect. 

Mr. Schwarz remarked that not all Blattidce lived in dirty or 
dark places. On the island of Key West he had frequently seen 
a species of the West Indian genus Plectroptera (probably por- 
cellana), which lives on the tops of shrubs and trees. The agil 
ity of this curious Blattid, which resembles in appearance a small 
Dytiscid beetle, is really wonderful. The few specimens pro 
cured by him were donated to the National Museum.

SOME REMARKS ON SOUTH AMERICAN 

BY WM. H. ASHMEAD. 

Mr. Herbert H. Smith, an indefatigable collector and the well-known 
collector for Messrs. Godman and Salvin, the originators of that great 
work on the fauna of Central America, " Biologia Centrali-Amerieana," 
has transmitted to me, to work up, quite an extensive series of Ckalcididte^ 
collected by him in South America, principally along the Amazon, among 
which are some remarkable forms in genera unknown to our fauna, and 
that throw so much light on the classification of this perplexing Family 
that I think some remarks on the more striking forms may not be unac 
ceptable to-night. 

In the collection are representatives of most of the groups of this family, 
as defined by recent writers, only a few of which, however, have been 
studied, and I shall therefore confine my remarks to the more peculiar and 
striking forms. 

The sub-family Eucharince is represented by several of the genera as de 
fined by Mr. Kirby. I have recognized Thoracantha, Schizaspidia, 



OF WASHINGTON. 219 

Uromeh'a, Kapala, Lirata, Tetramelia, Stilbura, Psilogaster, Chalcura, 
and Orasema, mostly by forms already described. 

The next sub-family, or the Perilampince, is represented by several 
forms, possibly undescribed. 

The Eurytomince are well represented, and I find species agreeing with 
our North American genera Isosoma, Eurytoma, Decatomx, Rileya, &c. ; 
but of the greatest importance is the discovery of a form closely allied to 
Axima Walker, and that convinces me that this genus, separated by recent 
writers as the type of a sub-family, Axi mince * is in reality nothing but*an 
abnormally developed form belonging to this group. 

This new form has the thorax, abdomen, and wings of a Eurytoma, a 
head similar to Axima, only the frontal spines are not so prominent and 
less acute; the head is deeply emarginated for the reception of the anten- 
nal scape, with sharp ridges or carinae between it and the eyes* 

In this group I believe should also be placed the genus Chryseida Spin- 
ola, although Prof. Westwood has placed it with the Perilampince. 

The next sub-family, or the Chalcidince, is most abundant, South 
America apparently being the home of this group. Such genera as Dir- 
rhinus, Thaumatelia, Spilochalcis, Smicra, Chalet's, Haltichella, Poda- 
grion, &c. , have been recognized. 

Dirrhinus has not before been reported from South America, the known 
species being from the south of Europe and Asia. Its discovery on the 
Amazon is therefore interesting. 

One of the species of Podagrion, a genus parasitic in the eggs of Man 
tis, is remarkable for its abnormally swollen antennal club. 

The Leucospina? are poorly represented, but three species being in the 
collection. One of these, however, is Leucospis tomentosa Kirby, a rare 
species up to the present time, but a single specimen being known, Mr. 
Kirby' s type. in the British Museum. 

I consider the Leucospinte closely allied to the Torymina;, through cer 
tain exotic genera, and through the Torymince we reach the Eupelmince. 

Eupelmince in South America spread out into many wonderful and re 
markable genera, showing strong affinities with different groups, most 
perplexing to the systematist, and suggesting a closer affinity between 
this group and certain Pteromalids, such as the Cleonymides, Chiropach- 
ides, Miscoga strides, &c. Their tout ensemble is the same, and un 
doubtedly a close relationship exists between these groups, difficult to 
define at present, but when the forms of different countries are more abun 
dantly collected and carefully studied a much more satisfactory and natural 
arrangement of these groups than that now in vogue can be devised. 

In the Eupelmince, besides the genera defined in Mr. Cresson's " Syn 
opsis," I would place Pelecinella Westw., Prionopelma Westw. , Oodera 
Westw., Metapelma Westw., Epistenia Westw., Cleptimorpha Walker, 
Thaumasura Westw., and Solenura Westw. 

Phlebopenes Perty I do not know; but it probably belongs in this group. 

Westwood says Pelecinella is allied to Callimome, a Torymid genus ; 



220 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

but to me it seems but a remarkable form in the Eupelmtnce. It has all 
the characters of the group, and falls in it naturally. 

I have recognized Pelecinella phantasma Westw. in Mr. Smith's collec 
tion, and have brought specimens with me to-night to ascertain whether 
Mr. Howard does not coincide with me as to its position. I also exhibit 
a new species in this genus, which I propose to call Pelecinella West- 
woodii, in honor of this venerable and distinguished master of our science. 

Among other rarities in the collection, I was much delighted to recog 
nize Westwood's genus Polychroma and one of his species Polychroma 
htstrionicum. 

It is one of the most remarkable of Chalcids, with the brilliant metallic 
colors of the Toryminte and Pteromalince, the swollen toothed posterior 
femora of the Chalcidince and Leucospince, the front legs of the Chiro- 
pac/iides, the ejes and thorax of Cleonymus, antennae similar to Rupelnius, 
and an abdomen peculiarly its own, although similar to certain Ptero- 
malids. 

This genus, with the genus Chalcodectus Walker, I propose to separate 
as a distinct sub-family, Polychromince. Types of the genus Polychroma 
are exhibited to-night. 

Mr. Westwood's Lycisca ignicaudata has also been determined. The 
genus Lycisca belongs properly to the tribe Chiropachides in the Ptero- 
malincz, and bears some resemblance to my genus Dasyglenes, a genus 
parasitic on bees, Osnit'a sp. 

Of the other groups I can at present say but little, not having had the 
time to study them. 

The Encyrtinte, Aphelinince, Pteromalince, Entedontncz, and Tetra- 
stichince are all represented. 

Before closing, I would like to draw special attention to a remarkable 
form in the Rncyrtince, allied to Tetracnemus, a genus which I had the 
pleasure of exhibiting to you at a previous meeting. This form has, how 
ever, six-branched antennae, and is probably the type of a new genus. 

You will see, on examination, that excepting in its antennal characters 
it agrees w:th many forms in the Encyrtince thorax, venation, legs, &c. 
The antennas are similar to those of some of the Eulophintz. 

Mr. Howard, in discussing this paper, said that he agreed with 
Mr. Ashmead in placing Axima in the sub-family Eurytomince, 
and he also thought Mr. Ashmead correct in his additional genera 
in the Eupelmince. 

Mr. Schwarz thought it somewhat remarkable that there were 
almost no new genera ; but Mr. Ashmead, in reply, stated that 
this fauna had been very thoroughly worked out in various papers. 

Mr. Howard then read the following note :

AUTHORSHIP OF THE FAMILY MYMARID^E. 

BY L. O. HOWARD. 

Without expressing further my views of the rank and position of the 
group of parasitic Hymenoptera of which Curtis's genus Mymar is the 
type, I wish to call attention to tahe fact that Haliday (Hym. Brit., London, 
1839) is tnc original proposer of the group name Mymaridse (see Agassiz, 
Nomen. Zool.. Hym., 22), and that therefore the symbol " m." placed 
after this work in Mr. Ashmead's " Proposed Natural Arrangement of the 
Hymenopterous Families" (Proc. Entom. Soc. Wash., vol. i, p. 98), is 
probably due to an oversight, and should be replaced by the word " Hali 
day." From the context it will be seen that Mr. Ashmead was familiar 
with Haliday's views as to the position of this group, but he overlooks the 
important " idae" ending used by the older author. 

The Agassiz reference would fix the authority for the use of " Mymari- 
dce" as a word, and although I do not possess a copy of the Haliday paper 
I had concluded that he considered the group as of family rank, for the 
reason that in a review of No. i of the Monograph, in Isis, 1840, page 407, I 
notice that the Diapridse, the Ceraphronidse, the Dryinidae, and the Bethyl- 
id;e are considered as families, of equal rank with the Pelecinidae and the 
Proctotrupidie, all coming under the Tribe Oxyura, while from Haliday's 
other writings it was easily seen that he retained " id*" ending for groups 
of family rank. 

Through the kindness of Mr. Cresson, however, I have received a copy 
of a portion of this monograph, in which I see that Haliday calls Mymari- 
dse '*Fam. 17" of his tribe 4 Halticoptera, the families Chalcididai and 
Leucospida? forming families 16 and 15 respectively. The family Myma- 
ridoe should therefore be considered as belonging to Haliday. 

Mr. Ashmead said that he now agreed with Mr. Howard, but 
at the time of writing his paper on the Hymenoptera (see ante, 
p. 98) he considered that Haliday had used the name more as a 
group than a family.

STRAY NOTES ON INJURIOUS INSECTS IN SEMITROPICAL FLORIDA. 

BY E. A. SCHWARZ. 

For any one desirous of making observations on insects injurious to cul 
tivated plants, semitropical Florida is not the right place to go to, for the 
reason that there is very little agriculture or horticulture carried on on the 
Keys and the narrow coast strip of more than 500 miles in length, com 
prising the semitropical region of Florida. The settlement of Lake Worth 
is the southernmost point where fruit trees and garden vegetables are raised 
on a somewhat extended scale. Here some very interesting observations 
on injurious insects can, no doubt, be made; but on my trip I merely

I 

passed through Lake Worth, and at a season (in June) when the crops had 
long been harvested. In the region south of Lake Worth only occasionally 
a few garden vegetables and fruit trees are raised for the own use of the 
settlers, and are always planted in extremely small and isolated patches. 
As everyone knows, this mode of cultivation is the best protection against 
injurious insects, and thus the few cultivSted plants in southern Florida 
are, as a rule, remarkably free from injurious insects. 

Most settlers along Biscayne Bay and on the mainland farther south do 
not plant anything save perhaps a few cocoanut or orange trees, but sub 
sist by manufacturing starch from the roots of Zamia integrifolia. This 
wild-growing plant is therefore of the greatest economic importance for 
southern Florida. The insects infesting this plant are the larvae of JSu- 
mceus atala,?*. Coccid of the genus Diaspis, and the larva of a large Scarabajid 
beetle, probably Strategus mitceus. The first-named species has been the 
subject of a former communication.* It suffices to repeat here that in 
spite of its great abundance it is not injurious to the plant. The Coccid is 
too rare to be taken into consideration here ; but the Scarabaeid larva is 
very injurious. It infests the roots, or rather the subterranean stems, of 
the plant and renders them altogether unfit /or use. Fortunately it is tol 
erably rare. 

In the process of making starch two other insects acquire a certain im 
portance, viz., the larva of an Rristalis and that of a large species of the 
family Muscidce.\ Both larvae live in the greatest abundance in the 
refuse "coontie," the Eristalis larva in the fluid or semi-fluid portions 
thereof and the Muscid larva in the drier portion. The latter larva occa 
sionally gets into the starch which is laid out for drying, and fouls the 
same, but the Eristalis larva becomes especially a great nuisance by crawl 
ing into the well if the refuse coontie gets too dry. The construction of a 
well is the essential and most troublesome work in the manufacture of 
starch, since there is no fresh water wherever the coontie plant grows, and 
the well has to be cut through the solid coral rock to a depth of from 15 to 
20 feet. The Eristalis larvae get into the well by the myriad, and unless 
often and carefully cleaned out the well is soon changed into a cesspool 
full of decayed and decaying larvae and the water unfit for use. 

The most important cultivated plant in semi-tropical Florida is the 
Pineapple, which is raised on quite a large scale on the more northern 
and larger Keys. I failed to find any destructive insects thereon ; in fact, 
no insect whatever seems to feed on the leaves or the uninjured fruit. 
But the plant has a great enemy in the rats, and any fruit which has been 
injured by these rodents becomes at once infested by a multitude of insects 
(Nitidulid beetles and various Diptera). Another .plant of considerable 
economic importance, at least in the opinion of the settlers, is the Cocoa-

nut. Rabbits and rats are greatly destructive to the sprouting nuts, but 
no insects injurious to the young or old trees were observed by me. I 
even failed to get any evidence that Rhynchophorus crnentatus, which is 
said to injure young trees in other parts of Florida, ever attacks the Cocoa- 
nut on the Keys or the shores of Biscayne Bay. 

The Oranges, Limes, and allied fruit trees have the same enemies in 
semi-tropical Florida as in the true Orange region of the State. Orange 
dogs (larvae of Papilio cresphontes) are greatly injurious everywhere, 
but the various scale insects appear to be much less troublesome in the 
south than farther north, owing no doubt to the fact that no large groves 
are planted in the semi-tropical region. The few trees atCocoanut Grove 
on the shores of Biscayne Bay were remarkably free from scales, but along 
the Miami River and at Lake Worth they were quite abundant. The Lime 
trees, and to some extent also the young Orange trees, have a most for 
midable enemy in a moderate-sized vi.Q,\'\\*Artipusfto)'idanus, of the family 
Otiorkyficbtdte. The injury is done by this pest in the imago state, and 
consists in gnawing off the edges of the leaves of older trees, but more 
especially in devouring the young buds. During my stay at Cocoanut 
Grove a row of young Lime trees was set out, and every morning from 40 
to 70 beetles were found on each tree. After knocking these off into an 
umbrella and killing them, an equal number of beetles was found on each 
tree three or four hours later. Only a persistent and often-repeated jar 
ring gave the young buds an opportunity to start. The earlier stages of 
this pest are still unknown, but from analogy with the other species of the 
family OtiorJiynchidce we may infer that the larva lives underground on 
the roots of plants. Whether it is polyphagous as the imago or confined 
to a single plant we do not know.* 

A few West Indian and South American fruit trees, such as Mango, 
Guava, Alligator Pear, etc., are planted on almost every settlement, and 
seem to enjoy a perfect immunity from injurious insects. 

Of Sweet Potatoes I saw only at Cocoanut Grove a few patches, and 
was surprised to see not a single specimen of Cylas formicarius, which 
was found by Mr. Ashmead in great abundance on Metacumbe Key, less 
than 50 miles distant from my headquarters. The larvae and imagos of 



* The larval habits of many Otiorhynchidce have been made known in 
Europe, all of them being root-feeders ; but only two of our North Ameri 
can species have been studied in the earlier stages, viz., Aramigus Fulleri 
and Otiorhynchtis ovatus, the latter being common to Europe and North 
America. In contradistinction with the unity in larval habits in this 
family, Dr. Harris, while speaking of our most common species, Pandele- 
te.jiis hilarh, says (Treatise, etc., p. 70:) "The larva lives in the trunks of 
White Oak, on which the beetle may be found about the last of May and. 
the beginning of June." This account has frequently been quoted, but 
never verified or corroborated by any subsequent observation, and I am 
strongly inclined to doubt its correctness.

Coptocycla aurichalcea were, however, tolerably abundant, but I do not 
think that the plants suffered seriously thereby. 

Cucumbers, beans, beets, Irish potatoes, etc. , I did not see along Bis- 
cayne Bay ; a few watermelon vines at Miami harbored some Diabrotica 
vittata. 

A small patch of Egg-plants, the only one along the shores of Biscayne 
Bay, which was planted at the slope of the rocky pine-land toward the 
" prairie" (a narrow strip of swampy land formed by the accumulation of 
decayed sea-weeds), presented a curious aspect when I first visited the spot 
in the first days of May. The plants were literally covered with the larvse 
of a Noctuid, Cloantha derupta, which had not only almost entirely de 
foliated the egg-plants, but were also at work on some plants of Chenopo- 
dium near by. A week later not a single leaf was left on the plants and 
the worms had eaten into and hollowed out every one of the fruits of the 
egg-plant. The ground beneath the plants was full of pupai. I bred 
many specimens without obtaining a single parasite. 

> Some Tomatoes are raised on several settlements on Biscayne Bay, and 
I observed here, in the month of May, the young larva of a Heteropter- 
ous insect puncturing the ripening fruit. I mistook it at first for the larva 
of the common Squash-bug (Auasa tristis), but later in the season I saw 
it at Lake Worth in great numbers, and also in the pupa and imago states. 
It proved to be Phthia picta (determined by Prof. Uhler), family Corcidce, 
a West Indian species hitherto not recorded from the United States. The 
tomato is extremely sensitive to the " sting" of this bug, and drops off 
and decays quickly. At Lake Worth this insect worked in company with 
an allied species, Spartocera dtffitsa. The latter was somewhat less nu 
merous than the former, but in both species the puncturing of the tomato 
was done at least so far as my experience goes only in the larva and 
pupa stages. The only wild food-plant of both species appear to be Sol- 
anum nigrum, a common weed in semi-tropical Florida, and which is to 
be found near every human habitation throughout that region. It is no 
doubt by means of this plant that the two Heteroptera just mentioned 
have been enabled to gain a foothold in Florida and to spread from place 
to place. Phthia picta is capable of doing most serious damage to the 
tomato, and the danger is imminent that with the increase of the culti 
vated area in southern Florida it may reach the larger and more impor 
tant tomato fields in the northern part of the State. The advance of the 
insect immigrants from the West Indies into Florida appears to be an ex 
tremely slow one when compared with the rapid spread of insects 
imported from Europe; nevertheless some Central American insect pests 
have, within quite recent times, spread over a considerable area of the 
Southern States. The common Murgantia histrionica is now widely 
.distributed with us, although it found its way through Mexico and not 
through the West Indies and Florida. The Cotton Stainer, Dysdercus 
suturellus, gradually spreads northward through Florida, and occurs 
already in northern Florida and Alabama, while another most unpleasant 



OF WASHINGTON. 2*25 

immigrant, Conorhinus sanguisuga, is also slowly, but surely, spreading 
through Florida, although its spread from Mexico through the south 
western portion of the United States has been a much more rapid one. 

In conclusion, I would remark that in the vicinity of the settlements 
along Miami River and the shores of Biscayne Bay occasionally some wild 
growing and perennial cotton plants may be found. I carefully exam 
ined every one I came across, and although I found many other insects 
feeding thereon I never saw a single specimen of the Cotton Worm (Aletia 
xylina). 

Mr. Howard said that Murgantia histrionica (the Cabbage 
bug) had reached Maryland. 

Mr. Ashmead said that he had first taken Phthia picta on Meta- 
cumbe Key, and that they were. extremely abundant there, but not 
found on the other Keys. The faunae of the different Keys were 
very dissimilar. Around Jacksonville he had found the larvae of 
a Noctuid feeding on a wild Solatium, probably 5". nigrum. 

Mr. Schwarz.also read some notes on the Tobacco beetle, of 
which he furnished the following a-bstract : 

NOTES ON THE TOBACCO BEETLE (LASIODERMA SERRICORNE). Since 
for many years I have used various brands of smoking tobacco, and found 
the same often infested with Lasiodcrma serricorne, I collected in the 
course of time some notes on the food-habits of this beetle, which I shortly 
present herewith : 

First, it is my experience that the beetle and its larva are not found in 
tobaccos coming from northern factories and sold in northern cities. 
Thus, in the New York and Detroit tobaccos, which I bought at those 
places, I do not remember having ever seen living larvae or beetles, though 
occasionally dead beetles are met with, which I presume have been brought 
North with the leaves. If, however, a northern tobacco is brought South 
and kept in the stores for a longer period it becomes liable to be infested. 
Most southern factories are more or less infested with this pest, and more 
especially the Richmond tobaccos sometimes swarm with the insect in all 
stages. It is evidently a more southern species. 

It is further my experience that the' insect has a decided preference for 
the long-cut tobaccos, and for such brands thereof as are not flavored. I 
do not know what material is used for flavoring, but presume it to be some 
etheric oil, which is distasteful or injurious to the beetle. Block-tobacco 
(the so-called natural-leaf tobacco) and allied brands compressed into the 
form of cakes or plates are occasionally, though not often, infested, and I 
presume only when such brands are very old. Short-cut tobaccos are not 
liked by Jhe beetle, and even the Durham tobacco, which is by far the most 
widely-used brand in the South -it is sold in little sacks is rarely found 
infested. 



226 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

The brand I have most frequently used is a long-cut, the "Richmond 
Gem Curly Cut tobacco," which I found to be pure and not flavored, but 
frequently infested by the beetle. It is sold either in tin boxes containing 
one or one-half pound each, or in paper packages containing four ounces 
each, both kinds of packages being by no means tight enough to keep out 
the beetles. It is now at once apparent that the paper packages are much 
less and more rarely infested than the tobacco kept in tin boxes. After 
watching the habits of the larva, I think the explanation of this difference 
is as follows : The paper packages are always as loosely packed as pos 
sible, so as to increase their size, whereas the tobacco in tin boxes is very 
tightly packed. It is just in the most compressed places of a box where 
the larvce prefer to live, and they dislike to be among the loosely packed 
particles. It would, in my opinion, be a preventive against the continuous 
breeding of the beetle if the tobacco were packed as loosely as possible. 

The damage done by this species to smoking tobacco is in reality a small 
one, since the larva is not a rapacious feeder,* and, moreover, a little ex 
perience will show that, unless very numerous, the larvae do not feed so 
much on the finely-cut tobacco leaves as on the hard pieces of leaf stems 
which are usually found in most brands and sold as tobacco leaves. On 
such pieces of leaf stems the eggs are also preferably laid, and in them 
the larvae excavate a kind of cradle wherein to change to chrysalids. A 
really carefully prepared long-cut tobacco, consisting only of finely-cut 
leaves, e. g. , the Turkish tobacco and similar expensive brands, will never 
be found to be badly infested. 

The larvse usually live in the midst or at the bottom of the box, and 
they are not so readily observed, since they do not move, and are always 
covered with a brownish dust; the beetles are, however, very active, and, 
unless in the act of ovipositing, have the habit of congregating on the top 
of the tobacco. 

Mr. Howard said that Mr. Lugger had proposed to cover the 
tobacco at night as a prevention. 

Mr. Schwarz said that the beetles fly both by day and by night.

rette into another.

ance and habits of a small spider, which, some years since, web 
bed and defoliated a peach orchard. Col. Redmond wrote (in 
confirmation of Mr. Ashmead's statements of the leaf-feeding 
habit of this spider at the meeting of the Society in December 
last) as follows : , 

* * * "I can only make a very plain and unscientific statement in 
regard to the insects that injured and destroyed my Peach trees at ' Holly 
wood,' near this city, some years since. 

" These insects made their appearance in great numbers in spring and 
early summer, and I soon began to notice their depredations on my young 
Peen-To and Honey peach trees just after they came into leaf. On exam 
ination, I saw that the insects were small spiders of a reddish brown or 
yellow color. They preyed upon and destroyed the young leaves very 
rapidly; built nests or hatching-places in the leaves ; gummed these to 
gether and filled them full of eggs; hatched out thousands of young, and 
continued their depredations. When an attempt was made to catch and 
destroy the old spider, she dropped off the tree and immediately secreted 
herself in the loose earth and grass near the base of the tree. This spider 
was very small, and shy, and quick in her movements. It was extremely 
difficult even to get a sight of her, unless you approached the tree with 
extreme caution. The destruction of the tree seemed to be effected by 
eating all the thick portion of the leaf, as a silk-worm eats the mulberry, 
and also by gumming up and sticking the leaves together by means of 
some adhesive secretion. 

" I used Paris Green, sprinkled over the trees, as a remedy; but unfor 
tunately I used this deadly substance too freely and killed most of my trees 
as well as the spiders.' 

" I much regret my inability to give you a regular and correct scientific 
description of this little 'free lance;' and I believe I have recited to you 
all his more salient and striking points. I feel quite positive that the in 
sect was one of the spider family, though I cannot name nor give a more 
accurate description of it." 

In the discussion of this communication, Dr. Marx stated that 
while spiders may cut oft' leaves and web them together, a study 
of their mouth parts renders it questionable whether any spider 
is phytophagous, which opinion was also held by Mr. W. M. 
Wheeler. Mr. Howard thought that Tortricid larvae, probably 
formerly abundant and overlooked, had attracted the spiders. Dr. 
Marx mentioned seeing a plant in the Smithsonian Grounds 
similarly covered with spiders some years since, and that the plant 
died in the following year. 



228 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

Mr. Schwarz read and commented upon portions of a letter by 
Henry Stanley, the famous explorer of Africa, and furnished the 
following abstract of his remarks : 

POISONOUS INSECTS IN CENTRAL AFRICA. Mr. Henry Stanley's first 
letters on the progress of the Emin Pasha relief expedition have been ex 
tensively quoted in scientific journals and newspapers; but one of his 
later letters, dated September i, 1888, and addressed to the Secretary of the 
Royal Geographical Society of England, where it was read at the April, 
1889, meeting, is less generally known; at least I have not seen a full 
copy in the more accessible literature, and I may be allowed to quote here 
with (in re-translation from " Das Ausland," 1889, p. 352) a passage which 
has some connection with entomology. The incident referred to iby 
Stanley occurred during his memoi'able march through the immense equa 
torial forest along the Aruwimi River, between the Congo and the Albert 
Nyanza. Of this dense and nearly impassable forest Stanley gives a most 
gloomy account; but it seems by no means to be destitute of insect life, 
for he says : " From July 5th till the middle of October the expedition 
moved along the banks of the river. * * * What a country for flies, 
bugs, and butterflies! While I write this the butterflies are in swarms 
about me, and flap with their wings in confirmation of my assertion. 
Large clouds of butterflies are daily for hours sailing up stream and across 
the same." 

A little further on he says: " In Avisibba the natives attacked our 
camp in a most determinate way. They thought that with their large 
provision of poisoned arrows they had the advantage of us, for as long as 
the poison is fresh it is most fatal. Lieutenant Stairs and five of our men 
were wounded by these arrows. Mr. Stairs' wound was from an arrow 
the poison of which was dry, and therefore several days old. He recuper 
ated only after three weeks' suffering; but the wound did not heal for 
several months. One man received a very light wound on the head and 
died five days later of lockjaw; another received a wound in the muscles 
of the upper arm near the shoulder, and died about six hours after the 
first man, also of lockjaw. Another, slightly wounded on the throat, died 
on the seventh day, and one wounded in the side, as I believe, died during 
the following night. All wounded men died of lockjaw. 

" We were of course very anxious to learn where this deadly poison is 
obtained from. On our return from the Albert Nyanza we stopped in 
Avisibba, and while looking through the huts of the natives we found sev 
eral packages of dried red ants or pismires, and only then we were in 
formed that the finely-powdered dried bodies of these insects, when boiled 
in palm oil, constitute the deadly poison by which we lost so many brave 
men after such terrible sufferings. 

" Now we wondered why we could have been ignorant so long regarding 
the nature of this poison, for we could have prepared all sorts of poisons 
from the many insects we had seen; for example, the big black ant, the 



OF WASHINGTON. 229 

bite of which causes a bad blister, would if prepared in the same way pro 
duce a by far more terrible poison ; the small gray caterpillars would 
furnish an irritating material, which if brought in contact with the blood 
would torture to death any man ; the fat spiders, several inches long and 
covered with spiny hairs which cause a painful itching on the skin, would 
produce another frightful mixture, the effect of which can only be imagined 
with a shudder. 

" The poison is prepared in the woods. In the depths of the forest the 
native lights his fire and prepares the terrible poison, to which even the 
mighty elephant succumbs. It is forbidden to prepare the poison in the 
vicinity of a village. In the forest the native applies the poison to the 
points of his arrows and covers the same with fresh leaves, so that he can 
not be poisoned himself, and is then ready for war." 

If we deduct from this account what is due to the probable amount of 
lying on the part of the natives or of Stanley's own men, the following 
facts remain : The natives have arrows provided with a powerful poison ; 
secondly, Stanley found in the dwellings of the natives quantities of dried 
ants, and was informed by the natives or his men that the bodies of these 
ants, when powdered or cooked in palm oil, furnish this poison. Con 
ceded the truth of the latter point, I think it is a novel fact that formic 
acid is utilized for poisoning arrows, and for this reason I deemed it worth 
while to quote the above passage. I leave it to the medical members of 
our Society to decide what is the effect of formic acid when brought in 
contact with the human blood, and, further, whether or not the effect of 
the poison is destroyed or altered by the process of preparation as de 
scribed by Stanley. 

In regard to the other poisonous insects mentioned by Stantey there is 
of course a great deal of exaggeration and imagination in Stanley's account, 
which is no doubt largely due to trying circumstances under which he 
penned his letters. The "small gray caterpillar " belongs evidently to 
the so-called stinging caterpillars, and represent the Lagoas and allied 
genera of the New World. It is a well-known fact that the poisonous 
quality resides in their hair covering, and that it is of a chemical and not of 
a mechanical nature. Some of the very large South American species of 
Lagoa are justly dreaded by every one, as testified by many travellers, and 
along the Everglades in southern Florida nothing is more feared by the 
Indians than a species of this genus which is said to reside in the pine 
woods. 

The large spider mentioned by Stanley appears to be one of the Thera- 
phosidce. His statement that the hairs of these spiders are poisonous is 
no doubt correct, and is corroborated by reliable authority. G. H. von 
Langsdorf, in his " Bemerkungen auf einer Reise um die Welt," v. I, p. 
63 fas quoted in Germar's Magazin d. Ent, v. i, 1813, pp. 183-184), says : 
" The bite of the Aranea avicularia is neither dangerous nor deadly, but 
is liable to cause severe inflammation. The hairs with which the body is 
everywhere covered are detached upon the slightest touch, and cause upon 



230 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

the skin a most unbearable, painful itching and burning, which in prepar 
ing and stuffing these spiders I several times had occasion to experience." 
In more recent times the poisonous nature of the hairs of Theraphosidcp 
has been utterly lost sight of, and the latest accounts of poisonous insects 
only refer to the bite of these large spiders. Whether the poisonous 
quality is due to some acid contained in the hollowed hairs or solely to 
mechanical irritation caused by the barbed nature of the hairs I have to 
leave undecided. 

In the discussion following, Dr. Marx stated that poisons are 
not soluble in oil, but are so in water and alcohol. He also be 
lieved that the hairs were not poisonous, but merely irritative, or 
perhaps in some cases barbed. 

Mr. Schwarz also read the following note : 

NOTES ON CICADA SEPTENDECIM IN 1889. 

By E. A. SCHWARZ. 

Our knowledge of the extent of Riley's Brood VIII of the Periodical 
Cicada (i 855-^2 -'89) is practically based upon Dr. Fitch's observations in 
1855 ; and its expected reappearance in 1872 has apparently not attracted 
any attention, since I fail to find in the more accessible literature any allu 
sions thereto. From this year's observations I am able to add three new 
localities to those already on record, viz : Maryland Heights, opposite 
Harper's Ferry, Va., where six specimens of Cicada septendecim were 
found by Mr. Heidemann and myself on Maj' i9th; the District of Colum 
bia, where, in the Smithsonian grounds, one pupa shell was found by my 
self on May 2ist, two pupae on May 24th, and two others the following 
day; and Alexandria county, Va., where, on May iyth and 24th, two pupa 
cases were found by Mr. Ashmead, and three other pupa shells and the 
wing of an imago on June 2d by myself. 

The Cicadas observed at Harper's Ferry were all freshly matured speci 
mens ; their pupa shells were in most instances found near the imago, and 
they were evidently the first to appear in that particular locality. They 
were all found on a very small clearing nearly surrounded by wood, and 
from which the trees had been cut down apparently in the winter of 
iSSy-'SS. None were found or seen within the woods themselves, and it 
is to this particular occurrence that I wish to call attention. There are 
several instances on record where Cicada septendecim emerged in hot 
houses weeks, or even months, earlier than outdoors. In such places the 
ground is warmed by artificial heat, and the development of the Cicada 
larvae or pupae had thus been accelerated. Now, a clearing made in the 
midst of a dense forest forms a natural hot-house, the soil receiving much 
more warmth on such places than in the shady woods. We should thus 
not wonder to see the Cicadas appear earlier on such cleared spaces than 
in the woods. I am even inclined to believe that under favorable circum- 



OF WASHINGTON. 231 

stances the Cicadas develop on such cleared places one or several years 
earlier than the time of their regular appearance, and that these precur 
sors, if numerous enough, would then be able to form a new brood. 

The appearance of the Cicadas in the District of Columbia and in Alex 
andria county, Va., is remarkable on account of the excessive rarity of 
the specimens. No one who does not particularly search for specimens, 
and who remembers the vast swarms of Cicadas in 1885 (Riley's Brood 
XXII), would suspect that we have this year a visitation of the Periodical 
Cicada. These few specimens can hardly be called a " brood," and it is 
much to be regretted that we have no records of previous appearances 
around Washington either in 1872 or 1855, so tnat we would be able to 
make comparisons. If the Cicadas were rare only within the city I would 
say that the sparrows had destroyed them in 1872, but since they are 
equally rare in the open country, I am at a loss to explain this scarcity. 
Moreover, the sparrows were in 1872 not nearly as numerous in Washing 
ton as they are now. I cannot see how the few specimens that have ap 
peared here this season can be able to perpetuate their race, and in 1906 
there will, in all probability, not a single specimen be seen in Washing 
ton and its surroundings. 

In the general discussion of this note by Messrs. Howard, 
Townsend, and others, the appearance of the Cicada this year in 
considerable numbers in parts of North Carolina and West Vir 
ginia was mentioned localities heretofore doubtful ; and also in 
less numbers in the District of Columbia, Maryland, and New 
Jersey. 

Mr. Schwarz presented for publication the following paper : 

FOOD-PLANTS AND FOOD-HABITS OF SOME NORTH AMERICAN COLEOPTERA. 

By E. A. SCHWARZ. 

Ino tmmunda. Larva and imago under bark of dead branches of Pinus 
tceda and P. palustrts, which are infested with Pityophthorus pulicarius, 
The larva probably preys on those of the latter species. It is a widely 
distributed species, and I found it in southern Georgia (in April), Vir 
ginia (in July), and Maryland (in August), always near the coast. 

Epur&a avara. Larvae, pupae, and images were found near Washing 
ton, D. C., on April 24th, within a beautiful orange-colored fungus grow 
ing around the branches and trunks of Pinus ino^s, and which has received 
the very appropriate name Peridendron cerebrum. The beetle is much 
more widely distributed than the fungus, and lives no doubt in several 
other fungi. 

Myrmechixauis latridioides is found plentifully by Mr. Ulke around 
Washington, D. C., in old stable-manure. 

Oxycnemus histrinus. This has been found by Mr. Hubbard at Baraboo, 
Wis., in October, on a subterranean fungus of the genus Phallus. 



232 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

Canthon viridis appears to live quite differently from its congeners, 
Avhich are so well known as " tumble-bugs." It occurs, in my experience, 
only under decaying leaves, and the larva probably subsists on such leaves, 
and not on dung. 

Aphodius serval is also not a dung-feeder, but occurs under old leaves. 
It appears late in the season, and rarely a hibernated specimen is found in 
spring, whereas the allied A. inquinatus is common in early spring and 
very rare in autumn. 

Cryptocephalus sckreibersi. This is one of the few Chrysomelida; which 
live exclusively upon pine trees, and is also one of the few species of this 
genus which hibernate in the imago state. 

Pachybrachys M-nigrum. Larva and imago in my experience only on 
Rhus toxicodendron. 

Adimonia rufosanguinea. Larva and imago on Azalea nudiftora, the 
imago in May and June, the larva in August. 

Pachyonychus paradoxus. The imago is common during the summer 
months around Washington on Smt'lax^ where it eats very regular, oblong 
holes in the leaves. The larva is certainly not found on the same plant 
above ground, and is either a root-feeder or infests some other plant. 

Haltica nana. Common in semi-tropical Florida, where the imago 
skeletonizes the leaves of Croton glandulosum. 

Hallica fuscocenea. Larva and imago abundant on CEnothera biennit in 
July and August. 

Chcetocnema quadricollis. Imago skeletonizes the leaves of Verbena 
urticifolia in southern Florida. 

Glyptina cyanipennis. The imago devours the epidermis of the leaves of 
Euphorbia cyatophora in southern Florida, and is very destructive to that 
plant, which, however, is an obnoxious weed. The larva was not ob 
served, and feeds probably on the roots. 

Phyllotreta chalybeipenuis. The food-plant of this species is Cakilf 
americana, the larva mining in the leaves of this maritime plant. 

Octotoma plicatula. The larva makes a tentiform mine in the leaves of 
Tecotna radicans; the imago eats oblong holes in the leaves. This is a 
common and widely distributed species, but generally overlooked by col 
lectors. The plant has a wider distribution than the beetle, which I failed 
to find in Michigan and in central and southern Florida. 

Cassida callosa feeds upon Solatium nigrum in southern Florida (Cres- 
. cent City and Lake Worth). 

Anthonomus profundus develops within the fruit of Cratcegus crus-galli, 
the imago appearing in July. 

, Conotrachelns similis is peculiar tp the " Gum-Elastic tree," Bumelia 
lantiginosa. The imago appears in great numbers when the tree is in 
bloom (in the month of June, at Crescent City, Florida), and no doubt ovi 
posits in the forming fruit. The larva has, however, not yet been ob 
served. 

Conotrachelus ventralis. This is a species hitherto known only from 



OF WASHINGTON. 233 

Florida. I found it quite abundantly in May along Biscayne Bay, exclu 
sively on Persea caroline.nsis, and have strong evidence that the larva is 
inquilinous in the galls of a Psyllid, Trioza magnolia;. Within these 
galls I found frequently either a large egg or a young larva of a Curculio- 
nid, and I do not hesitate to consider these as belonging to this Conotra- 
chelus, since the larva of another species of the genus (C. posticatus) has 
been observed to live within Homopterous (Phylloxera) galls. 

Cryptorhynchus obliquus breeds in Hickory branches which are broken 
by the wind or otherwise injured. The larva makes a tolerably straight 
gallery several inches long through the solid wood of the twig. 

Cryptorhynchus brachialis breeds in twigs of Bumelia lanuginosa. 

Cryptorhynchus fcrratus. This is a common species, which, near Wash 
ington, can be obtained from Oak, Chestnut, and various other trees. It 
extends to the semi-tropical region of Florida, but infests there onlv the 
branches of Per ~sea carolinensis, and is never met with on the Oak. 

Cryptorhynchus tristis develops under the bark of the trunk of Quercus 
coccinea. The imago feeds on the leaves, but is strictly nocturnal, hiding 
duri ig day time in the ground at the base of the tree. 

Chalcodermus ceneus occurred in great number in semi-tropical Florida 
on a species ofDolichos (probably the common Cow-pea run wild), the larva 
infesting the pods of the plants. 

Acamptus rigidns. This resembles in breeding habits certain Calandrid 
gentra.(PJU&opAagu$, Stenoscelis, Wollastonia}. On the trunks of various 
trees we frequently see larger or smaller spaces deprived of bark. The 
bark has not been chopped or taken off by force, but I think these decor 
ticated places are caused by the influence of frost. The wood on such ex 
posed places is always dead for some distance inward, and often very hard. 
In this case it attracts certain Ptinid beetles to bore and oviposit therein, 
but frequently the dead wood becomes affected by a kind of rot, which 
causes it to be soft, moist, and of a reddish color. It is in such cases that 
the Calandridce above mentioned and Acamptus rigidus undergo their 
development in the rottfng wood. 

Copturus binotatus. This rare species is, in Mr. Ulke's and my own ex 
perience, confined to Gleditschia triacanthus, but I cannot tell whether it 
develops in the thorns or in the branches. 

Plocamus hispidulus was bred by me in June from dead branches of Ro- 
binia pseudacacia infested with Agrilus larva. 

Himatium errans occurred abundantly at Tallahassee, Fla., in April, in 
the deserted galleries of Tom feus -cacographus under bark of Pinus pa- 
lustris. 

Himatium conicum breeds within the bark of Liriodendron tulipiferutn, 
numerous specimens having been thus found by me near Washington. 
I). C., in autumn. The two North American species of this genus can 
be distinguished only with difficulty.

stata cap it at a Hentz, which consists of a pair of straight rows of 
rather long, flattened, and blunt, closely-set bristles or rods, 25 to

the base of the first joints of the inferior spinnerets, closely over 
the underlying cribellum. From its structure and position, the

act as an accessory calamistrum. These organs have hereto

markable as they appear also in the common European species, 
Filistata testacea, as the speaker is informed by Prof. Thorell.

The little Chalcid, the subject of my remarks, and which I shall have the 
pleasure of showing you to-night, is not only one of the most anomalous 
of forms in the family Chalcilidce, but, on account of the peculiarity of 
the wings, one of the most remarkable insects in the order Hymenoptera. 

It was captured at large by my lamented friend Dr. R. S. Turner, at 
Fort George, Florida, and was only recently discovered among a quantity 
of unexamined material in this family that, for want of time, I have left 
unstudied. 

In nearly all of the hymenopterous families are forms that present 
marked structural peculiarities, spines or horns on the head, scutellum,

metathorax, coxze, femora, or abdomen; but none have yet been described 
with spines on the wings, as is the case with our little Chalcid. 

This Chalcid belongs to the sub-family Eulophince, but the cephalic, scu- 
tellar and wing characters are too anomalous for it to be placed in anv of 
the known genera, and it will therefore require the erection of a new genus 
for its reception. 

The head is very broad, much broader than the thorax, the occiput deeply 
concave, and the vertex very thin antero-posteriorly, while the lower por 
tion, about the region of the mouth, is abnormally thickened or swollen, 
the mandibles being remarkably small- almost obsolete and when viewed 
from the side a deep incision is seen between them and the clypeus, giving 
it a very peculiar appearance. 

The antennae are normal, agreeing with many other forms in this group, 
and the thorax does not differ greatly from many forms both in the sub 
family Eulophince and Elachistince, except that the shoulders are much 
more prominent than usual. 

The scutellum differs decidedly in that the grooves diverge posteriorly, 
and then curve and meet, forming a perfect frenum. 

The abdomen is remarkable only for its long petiole, this being longer 
than in any other form yet discovered. 

But what renders this Chalcid the most anomalous of hymenopters is 
the wings, the superior pair having a distinct conical spine covered with 
dense bristles (or it may be a dense tuft of bristles) on the superior mar. 
gin, at about where the submarginal nervure runs into the marginal, the 
character and use of which cannot be imagined, nor can one imagine the 
cause that induced the development of so remarkable an appendage. 

If such an anomalous appendage had been developed in a male, we. 
should have at once attributed it to sexual development, either as an adorn 
ment to please the fancy of the females, or as an armament development 
in the battles of the males for their favors. 

It is to be hoped that the male will soon be discovered, so we can see 
just what remarkable structural peculiarities he will present, and in what 
respect he differs from the female. 

For the reception of this chalcid, I have erected a new genus under the 
name Hoplocrepis, and the species may be known as Hoplocrepis albi- 
clavus, the descriptions of which are as follows : 

Hoplocrepis, n. g. 

Head very wide, much wider than the widest part of the thorax; the 
occiput deeply concave, leaving the vertex very thin antero-posteriorly. the 
3 ocelli arranged in a row on the sharp edge thus formed ; the face subconvex 
and the lower portion abnormally thickened through from throat to frons ; 
the mandibles are extremely small, nearly obsolete, and between them and 
the swollen face, when viewed from the side, is seen a peculiar deep in 
cision. 

Eyes large, oval, occupying more than two-thirds of the side of the head, 
leaving quite a wide space between them and the base of the mandibles.

Antenna S-jointed, inserted just above the cl jpeus ; the scape very long 
and slender, about as longas the flagellum, excluding the club; and when 
drawn close to the face extends slightly beyond the ocelli; pedicel cyathi- 
form ; joints of funicle 4, compressed about as in Sympiefis Forst., the 
first joint a little longer than the second, considerably longer than wide, 
the last two being about as long as wide; club 2-jointed, about half the 
width of the funicular joints. 

Thorax smooth, parapsides distinct, the shoulders very prominent, con 
vex; collar conical, the length of the mesonotum, and arranged along its 
posterior margin are six black bristles ; scutellum convex, with two grooves, 
the grooves diverging posteriorily and then curving around and meeting, 
forming a complete frenum, and two black bristles at base. 

Legs moderately long, slender, the posterior pair much the longest : 
coxae conical, the middle and posterior pairs contiguous, the last pair 
being the longest; all tibiae with one weak apical spur; tarsi 4-jointed, 
basal and second joint about equal, two following short. 

Abdomen ovate, depressed, longly petiolated, the petiole longer than 
posterior coxae, slender, cylindrical, attached to the metathorax*on a line 
above the posterior coxae; ovipositor slightly exserted. 

Wings with venation similar to Sympiesis, with two conical spines 
densely covered with black bristles, in appearance similar to the tuft on the 
scutellum in the Encyrtid genera Comys and Chiloneurus, and situated on 
the upper margin at about one-third the length of the wing. 

The head, scutellum, attachment of the abdomen to metathorax, and the 
wing characters at once distinguish this genus from any other in the sub 
families Eulophina and Elachistince, the only groups in which the genus 
.could be placed. 

Hoplocrepis albiclavus, n. sp. 

9- Length 1.5 mm. Pale brownish-yellow. Eyes black. Antennal 
scape l,ong, slender, yellowish; flagellum brown; club white. Coxae and 
petiole white ; basal portion of abdomen and three or four ventral seg 
ments beneath pale yellowish, the rest of the abdomen dark brown. Wings 
hyaline, with two transverse brown bands extending entirely across the 
wings, the first narrow at about one-third the length of the wing, and in 
cluding the abnormal spines or tufts ; the second is about three times the 
width of the first, with only a small clear space between it and the first 
band ; the whole apex of the wings clear. 

Described from a single specimen captured by the late Dr. R. S. Turner, 
at Fort George, Florida. 

Mr. Howard said that the spines on the fore wings were proba 
bly bunches of bristles, and that the collection of the Department 
of Agriculture contained a species having similar bristles on the 
forewings. Mr. Schwarz spoke of the occurrence, in Coleoptera, 
of spines on the elytra, mentioning genera in several families.

Mr. Howard called the attention of the Society to some en 
larged figures of the mouth-parts of Periplaneta orientalis in 
Miall and Denny's work on the Cockroach, in which no indica 
tion is given of a digitus proceeding from near the tip of the 
lacinia corresponding to the one described by Mr. Howard at a 
recent meeting of this Society.* 

Mr. Howard then briefly reviewed Miss Ormerod's recent book 
on South African Insects, and pointed out the striking similarity or 
correspondence in genus, if not in species, of the pests of the farm 
and garden of South Africa to those of this country. Among the 
insects especially noted were a Cetoniid enemy to figs and peaches 
(Rhabdotis semipunctata} ; Papilio demoleus, represented here 
by the Orange Dog, P. cresphontes ; the little cabbage moth (Plu- 
tella cruciferarum), widely distributed over the world ; an Orange 
fly ( Ceratitis citripcrda), having a habit similar to our Trypeta 
hidens, Icerya purchasi, etc. 

Mr. Howard also read Mr. H. Edward's paper on " Noises 
made by Lepidoptera," prepared for " Insect Life."f 

This very interesting paper called forth a considerable discus 
sion by various members relative to the noises produced by Lepi 
doptera and other insects. 

Mr. Schwarz read the following paper : 

MYRMECOPHILOUS COLEOPTERA FOUND IN TEMPERATE NORTH AMERICA. 

By E. A. SCHWARZ. 

Toward the close of the last century it was already known to the ento 
mologists of that early date that certain insects could be found in the nests 
of ants, but no further attention was paid to the subject until, in 1813, the 
Rev. P. W. J. Miiller published, in Germar's Magazin der Entomalogie, 
a remarkable paper on the Coleopterous genus Claviger, in which he 
proved that the species of this genus occur exclusively among certain 
species of ants; that the beetles were for their living entirely dependent 
on the ants, which feed and take care of the beetles in order to enjoy the 
licking of a secretion which exudes on the tufts of hair on the first abdom 
inal segment of the beetle. Muller succeeded also in finding the pupa 
skin of Claviger in the ants' nest, thus proving that its larva also lives 
among ants. His paper attracted a great deal of attention ; but, although 
we know now many species of Claviger and many allied genera, our

knowledge of the biology of this genus has not advanced a single step 
beyond the results obtained by Miiller. In fact, no one has hitherto been 
able to rediscover the pupa skin. 

For nearly thirty years afterwards only the captures of various insects 
among ants were recorded by various authors, but in 1841 and 1844 Mr. 
Fred. Mserkel. of Saxony, published (Germar's Zeitschr. f Ent. , vols. 
iii and v) the first comprehensive work on myrmecophilous insects. He 
raised the number of these insects to 284, distributed as follows among the 
different orders: Coleoptera, 274; Orthoptera, i; Heteroptera, 3; Hy- 
menoptera, 2 ; Diptera, 4 (among them a then unknown larva, which 
afterwards proved to be that of Merodon}. In the same year (1844) Schi- 
oedte added quite a number of species belonging to various orders, and 
numerous additions in Coleoptera were made in 1846 by Prof. Maeklin. 
In the latest catalogue of myrmecophilous insects, Mr. E. Andre (Revue 
et Mag. Zool., 1874) enumerates no less than 584 species, among them 542 
Goleoptera, but of these more than 250 must be considered as more or less 
accidental visitors of ants' nests. 

Moerkel proposed to arrange myrmecophilous insects in three groups: 
ist, species which live among ants only in the larva and pupa stages, but 
which, as imagos, leave the company of ants (e.g., Euryomia, Coscinop- 
tcra, etc.j; 2d, species which in the imago state are often met with 
among ants, but often also at other places not in company of ants (the 
numerous accidental visitors) ; 3d, species which in the imago state (and 
presumably also as larva) are exclusively found in the nests of ants, and 
the existence of which appears to depend upon the ants (the true myrme 
cophilous insects). 

He excludes certain Membracidce and Aphz'didce which, properly speak 
ing, do not live among ants of their free will, but are carried into the nests 
by the ants and held in captivity. These would constitute a fourth class, 
and later discoveries added thereto certain species of Formicidce, which 
are kept as slaves by other species of ants. A fifth class would be formed 
by the true parasites of ants, viz., certain Diptera (probably Conopidce)., 
Hymenoptera (Chalcididce and Proctotrupidce}, and Coleoptera (Stylopi- 
dce}. 

In more recent times important contributions have been made to our 
knowledge of the biology of myrmecophilous insects and their relations to 
the ants mainly by the investigations of von Hagens, Lespes, Sir John 
Lubbock, A. Forel, E. Andre, and E. Wasmann. These investigations are. 
of course, connected with great difficulties. If we uncover from beneath a 
stone or a log a colony of ants, or if we dig into a large ant-hill, the in 
habitants are at once put into the greatest uproar, and no observations can 
be made. To closely observe the domestic life of the ants and their inqui- 
lines it is necessary to construct artificial formicaries in suitable glass 
jars, as described by Sir John Lubbock. Among the authors just men 
tioned, Mr. Wasmann has, since the year 1886, reviewed the previous rec 
ords and augmented the same by a long series of the most interesting

original observations (published in the Tijdschrift v. Entom., 1887; 
Deutsche Ent. Zeit, 1886 and 1887; Wiener Ent. Zeit, 1889). He not 
only discovered the earlier stages of some myrmecophilous Coleoptera, 
but to him we owe also a great deal of information regarding the life- 
habits of myrmecophilous insects and their relations to the ants. 

As a result of his observations, Mr. Wasmann has been able to subdivide 
the genuine myrmecophilous insects (Maerkel's group 3) as follows : 

ist. Species which are fed by the ants and from which these derive a 
benefit in licking up a certain secretion. To this group belong, of the 
Coleoptera, the genus Claviger, and, no doubt, all allied genera and, fur 
ther, the species of Lomechusa. 

2d. Species which are treated with indifference by the ants and which 
live off the bodies of dead ants and other animal and vegetable debris to 
be found in the colonies of ants. The ants evidently derive some benefit 
from this class of inquilines, and their behavior toward them is certainly 
not hostile. To this class belong most of the Staphylinidce (excepting 
Lomechusa and Myrmedonta), most of the other Clavicorn beetles (except 
ing, perhaps, the genus Hetterius and other Histeridce), and most species 
of the other Orders ; in short, by far the largest majority of the insects 
recognized as myrmecophilous. 

3d. Species found only among ants, but which are by no means "myr 
mecophilous " in the usual sense of the word ; they like the ants as the 
wolf does the sheep, /'. e., they kill and devour the ants and steal their 
eggs, larvae, or pupae, wherever they have a chance of doing so. To this 
class belong the numerous species of Myrmedonia, Quedtus brevis, and in 
all probability the genus Hetcerius and other Histeridte. The ants are 
decidedly hostile to this class of inquilines, and attack and kill theni 
whenever they are able to take hold of them ; but these robbers are well 
protected, partly by their much greater agility and partly by their hard 
covering. The Myrmedonias and Quedius brevis, which are soft-bodied 
insects, carefully avoid mingling with the ants in their galleries, but hide 
like highway robbers near the entrance of the nest, or within the walls of 
the galleries, and watch their chances of attacking a solitary ant unawares. 
The Hetaerius, on the other hand, freely mingle with the ants; their cover 
ing is extremely hard and very smooth, and moreover their antennae and 
legs are retractile, so that the ants cannot do anything with them. As Mr. 
Lewis says, the ants evidently regard these Hetaerius as an unavoidable evil, 
against which they are unable to defend themselves, and they get along 
with the beetles as best they can. 

These groups just mentioned are by no means strictly separated, and 
many myrmecophilous insects cannot be classified at present. 

In North America myrmecophilous insects have been discovered since 
more than 40 years, and recorded as such by various authors in describing 
these species or otherwise ; but until quite recently these records wtre 
scattered all through the North American entomological literature. As 
far as the Coleoptera are concerned, Dr. John Hamilton has, with his ac- 



240 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

customed carefulness, collated these records and augmented the same with 
original observations in'his paper entitled " Catalogue of the Myrmecoph 
ilous Coleoptera, with bibliography and notes," published in the Canad. 
Entom., v. 20, 1888, pp. 161-166. Some additions were published by him 
in the same periodical, v. 21, 1889, PP- 105-108. In the other Orders the 
records of North American myrmecophilous species are extremely meagre. 
Among the Lepidoptera, Helta americalis ; of Orthoptera. two species of 
Myrmecophila ; of the Diptera, one or several species of Merodon and an 
unknown dipterous parasite. There are apparently no North American 
records of myrmecophilous Hymenoptera, although in Europe numerous 
species are known as such (genera Neomyrmex, Formicoxenus, Xenomyr- 
mex, Tomognathus, Ceraphron, Diapria, etc.), and no such records of 
Heteroptera, although several species are recorded in Europe, e. g., the 
genus Microphysa. In the Homoptera there are a few short references to 
certain Apktdtdce (by Walsh), but none to Membracidce, although at least 
one species is commonly met with among ants. In Thysanoptera, Arach- 
nida, and Myriapoda myrmecophilous species or genera are known in 
Europe, but I have not come across any American records, although every 
one who has done any collecting among ants knows that a species of the 
Thysanopterous genus Beckia is extremely abundant in almost every ants' 
nest, and that at least two species of Acarids swarm in the larger colonies 
of Formica integra and other species. The Neuroptera seem to be the 
only Order of which no myrmecophilous species are known. 

My principal reason for presenting herewith a list of our myrmecophilous 
Coleoptera so shortly after that published by Dr. Hamilton is that I am 
able to add, in a number of instances, the names of the ants among which 
the beetles have been found. Mr. Fred. Blanchard, of Lowell, Mass., has 
been kind enough to send me specimens of the ants among which he had 
discovered Coleoptera ; some other species of ants in connection with their 
Coleopterous inquilines were furnished by Messrs. Ulke and Pergande, 
while the remaining species were observed by Mr. H. G. Hubbard or by 
myself. 

Regarding the names of the ants mentioned in previous records and in 
Dr. Hamilton's list it maybe said that " Formica pennsylvanica " is = Cam- 
ponotus pennsylvanicus ; "Formica herculanea " also = C. pennsylvani- 
cus ;* " Lasius integerrimus /"' is apparently a wrong determination, and 
perhaps =Z,. claviger ; " Formica rufa," probably also incorrectly deter 
mined, is either = F. integra or exsectoides, or an allied species. For these 
determinations, as well as for those of the other Formicidce mentioned in 
the following lists, I am indebted to Mr. Theodor Pergande, who is the 
best authority in this country on this difficult group of Hymenoptera, and 
without whose help I would have been unable to prepare the appended list. 

It appeared to me advisable to exclude from the list of myrmecophilous 

*

herculaneus.

Coleoptera those species which, in my opinion, are to be considered as 
accidental or occasional visitors or intruders in ants' nests. Many of these 
species recorded by former observers were already considered as doubtfully 
myrmecophilous by Dr. Hamilton. This list of accidental visitors could 
be still greatly extended from unpublished material, but I mention here 
only the following : 

Panagceus crucigerus, found hibernating in ants' nests (Hamilton), 
with Lasius claviger (Pergande); Casnonia pennsylvanica, with Prenole 
pis nitens (Pergande) ; Bembidium 4-maculatum; Tachys incurvus, found 
abundantly with Formica exsectoides (Blanchard) ; Colon (no species has 
been found among ants by American observers); Scydmcenus capillosulus; 
S. brevicornis; Eumicrus grossus, found with ants by Mr. Ulke;* E. Mots- 
chulskii, with Lasius alienus ( Schwarz); Decarthron formisceti; Quedius 
molochinus, with Lasius claviger (Pergande) ; Leptacinus longicollis; Dio- 
chus Schatimi'i; Edaphus nitidus, found with Formica exsectoides and Aphce- 
nogaster fulva (Schwarz); Stictocranius puncticept; Lathrobium dimidia- 
tum, found with Prenolepis parvula and Cremastogaster lineolata (Per 
gande, Schwarz); Lithocharis sp., with Solenopsis debilis (Pergande); 
Tachyporus brunn.eus; T. scitulus; Conosoma pubescens; Apocellus sphce- 
ricollis, found often with Ponera contracta (Pergande); Arpedium 
Schivarzi with Prenolepis parvula (Pergande); Eleusis pallidus; Pteni- 
dium evancscens; Hister Harr'isii, found with Camponotus pennsylvani- 
cus? (Hamilton), and possibly to be included among the myrmecophilous 
species ; Hister americanus, with Ponera contracta (Pergande) ; Meli- 
gethes brassicce; Cyphon padi; Pleurophorus ccesus, with Prenolepis fulva 
(Pergande); Atcenius cognatiis, with Formica fusca and Aphcenogaster 
fulva (Pergande, Schwarz) ; Serica vespertina, with Formica Schaufussi 
and Lasius interjectus (Pergande); Dicedus punctatus, vi\t\\Aph(znogaster 
fulva (Schwarz). 

REVISED LIST OF NORTH AMERICAN MYRMECOPHILOUS COLEOPTERA. 

The following list enumerates the true myrmecophilous species /. e., 
those which live in ants' nests during all stages of development; further, 
those which are myrmecophilous only in the larva state, those which are 
myrmecophilous only in the imago state, and those which are more fre 
quently found among ants than elsewhere. But it includes also quite a num 
ber of still doubtful species, for which it must be left to future observa 
tion whether they are to be retained here or referred to the list of accidental 
visitors. For the bibliographical references of previous records the reader 
is referred to Dr. Hamilton's list. 

* The specimens found with ants at Washington, D. C., constitute, ac 
cording to Mr. Ulke, a species distinct from the true . grossus from Ala 
bama and Florida. If this be correct, it has to be transferred, as Eumicrus 
n. sp., to the list of myrmecophilous species.

group (hind tibiae without spur) are strictly myrmecophilous, while many 
species of the second group (hind tibiae with long terminal spur) appear to 
live quite independently from the company of ants. B. globicollis is cer 
tainly not myrmecophilous, and the same may be said of -6. spretus and 
allied eastern species which have been separated therefrom by Captain 
Casey. The determinations of some of the following species of this genus 
are possibly incorrect.

Ruryusa obtusa. Formica Integra (Schwarz); F. exsectoides (Per- 
gande). 

Ruryusa n. sp. Lasius bicornis (Patton). A single specimen, col 
lected at Waterbury, Conn., was given me by Mr. W. H. Patton. The 
label bears the following inscription : "The beetle on the ground, not near 
nest; the ant was playing with it; the beetle turned up its abdomen, and 
the ant opened its mandibles." 

Megastilicus formicarius. Formica exsectoides (Blanchard). 

Platymedon laticollis. Formica obscuripes (Schwarz) ; occurs in Ari 
zona, Colorado, and Nebraska. 

Oxytelus n. sp. Formica obscuripes (Schwarz); occurs in Colorado and 
Nebraska. 

Oxytelus placusinus. Formica fusca, Lasius alienus (Schwarz) ; occa 
sionally met with under decaying leaves, and not in company of ants. 

Limulodes paradoxus. Lasius aphidicola (Schwarz). 

B rocky a cant ha JtLrsina. The larva is abundant near Washington, D. C., 
in the colonies of Lasius claviger, preying upon the Pemphigus domes 
ticated by the ants (see J. B. Smith : "Ants' nests and their inhabitants," 
Amer. Nat., v. 20, 1886, p. 680). Whether or not this is the normal habit 
of the larva must be left to future observations. 

Rmphylus americanus. A specimen of the ant among which I found 
this in Colorado is in the LeConte collection at Cambridge, and, judging 
from memory, it belongs to Lasius. 

Hypocoprus formicetortim. Formica obscuripes (Schwarz). 

Hister planipeSi Camponotus pennsylvanicus ? (Hamilton); Formica 
exsectoides (Blanchard). 

Hister perpunctatus. Formica Schaufiissi (Blanchard). 

Hister repletus. Lasius niger (Blanchard). I agree with Dr. Hamilton 
that H. subopacus is probably also myrmecophilous. 

Hetcerius brunnipennis. Formica fusca (Hubbard) ; F. exsectoides 
(Blanchard). 

Hetcerius Blanchardi. Aphcenogaster fulva (Blanchard). The western 
species of Hetcerius are unquestionably strictly myrmecophilous, but I 
have not been able to obtain specimens of the ants. 

Rchinodes setiger* The various species of ants, among which this is re 
ported from South Carolina and Georgia, cannot be determined in the ab 
sence of specimens. R. decipiens is no doubt also myrmecophilous, and 
probably also the genus Ulkeus, 



OF WASHINGTON. 245 

Amphotis Ulkei. Cremastogasterlineolata (Ulke, Schwarz); Formica 
S^/i (Pergaiufc); F. integra (Schwarz). Mr. Ulke mentions as host 
also F. rufa, but this must be referred to F. Integra or Schaufussi. My 
experience with this beetle is that in early spring it is strictly myrme- 
cophilous, but in the fall of the year it is found in decaying fungi. The 
second species of this genus, A. Schwarzt, will no doubt also prove to be 
myrmecophilous, but it has hitherto been found only washed up on the 
beach at Fortress Monroe, Va. 

Monotoma fulvipes. Occurred in great numbers in the hills of Formica 
obscuripes in Colorado (Schwarz), but has been found in the Eastern 
States not in company of ants. 

Euparia castanea.Solenopsisgeminata (Riley, Schwarz). 
Euphoria iuda.A Cetoniid larva, undoubtedly referable to this species, 
is quite common near Washington, D. C., in midsummer in the smaller 
hills of Formica integra. The imago I never met with among ants, but 
Mr. L. Brunei- writes that he found it in the hills of F. obscuripes. 

Euphoria Airtipes.Ulr. L. Bruner kindly informs me that he never 
found the larva, but only the imago, near West Point, Neb. The beetles 
occur quite abundantly in the hills in the centre as well as around the 
edges of Formica obscuripes, as many as two dozen having been found in 
a single ants' nest. It was found under the same conditions by Mr. G. M. 
Dodge at Glencoe, Neb., and has, to my knowledge, never been observed 
remote from ants' nests. Mr. Bruner also states that he has occasionally 
found in the hills of the same ant specimens of another Euryomia of the 
size of E. melancholica, of which, however, no specimens have been pre 
served. It is, perhaps, E. pilosicoliis, which, from its great hairiness, 
may be supposed to be myrmecophilous. 

Cremastochilus. There is nothing to indicate that the unity in habit is 
interrupted in this genus. The larva? have not yet been discovered, but 
live, no doubt, at the bottom of ants' nests. That the ants derive a cer 
tain benefit from the beetles and try to prevent the escape of the latter 
from their nests, has already been observed by Prof. Hentz (see Scudder's 
" Entomol. Corresp. of T. W. Harris," p. 7). I mention here only those 
species of which I am able to give the name of the host. 

Crcmastochilus variolosus, Aphcenogaster fulva (Schwarz). 
Cremastochilus squamulosus. Camponotus esuriens (Hubbard). 
Crcmastochilus castanets. Formica integra (Schwarz);/''. Schaufussi 
(Pergande). 

Cremastochilus canaliculatus. Camponotus pennsylvanicus (Hamilton). 
An undetermined species occurs among Formica obscuripes in Nebraska 
(Bruner). 

Coscinoptera dominicana. Larva abundantly in a large anthill in Wis 
consin (Riley); Camponotus melleus (Pergande). 

Coscinoptera ? sp. Larval cases in great abundance in the hills of For 
mica obscuripes in Nebraska (Bruner). The imago has not been bred. A 
third larva belonging to the Clythrini was found in ants' nests in Arizona 



24ft ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

by Mr. Morrison, according to Prof. Riley (Amer. Nat., 1882^.598). 
The relationship of these Chrysomelid larvae to the ants has not yet been 
ascertained, 

Arceoschizus armatus. This is myrmecophilous, according to a com 
munication from Mr. H. F. Wickham, but he did not preserve specimens 
of the ant. I do not know whether or not this is the normal habit of this 
species. Of another species of this genus, A. sulcicollis, Dr. Horn re 
marks (Trans. Amer. Philos. Soc., v. 14, p. 274) : "Under stones in very 
dry places, and very frequently, though probably merely accidentally, 
among ants." 

Alaudes singnlaris. " Specimens are very rare and found living with a 
small black ant under stones*' (Dr. Horn, 1. c., p. 362); also found among 
ants by Mr. H. F. Wickham. I have not the slightest doubt that this 
species is strictly myrmecophilous. No specimens of the ant are pre 
served. 

Hymenorus rufipes. Larvae of this occur commonly in the hills of 
Formica fusca at Washington, D. C. (Pergande, Schwarz), and in the 
nests of Aphcenogaster Trcati (Pergande) ; the pupae of//. obscurusvfQro, 
found by Mr. Pergande among Formica fuse a. I hardly believe that these 
or other species of Hymenorus are strictly myrmecophilous in the larva 
state. 

Anthicus n. sp. ? A small yellow species, which I cannot refer to any 
described species, occurred abundantly in the hills of Formica obscuripes 
in Colorado (Schwarz). Every hill I examined contained many hundred 
specimens of the beetle. 

If this material, so far as rendered available by the determinations of the 
ants, is arranged according to the hosts, we obtain the following list :

Dr. Marx said that the myrmecophilous spider, Myrmekiaphila

mentioned by Mr. Schwarz were probably parasites of the Aph- 
ids or Dipterous larvae to be found in ants' nests, as these genera 
of Hymenoptera were well known to be parasitic on Aphids and 
Diptera.

Eight persons present. President Schwarz in the chair. 

Dr. Marx added two genera of spiders, Synemosyna and Syna- 
geles, to the list of myrmecophilous insects presented by Mr. 
Schwarz at the 'previous meeting. 

Mr. Ulke mentioned that he had found a specimen of Micro- 
rhopala melsheimeri in an ants' nest at Pen Mar, Pa. This spe 
cies might prove to be a true myrmecophilid. 

Mr. Schwarz thought that it could only be a messmate of the 
ants in the larva state, if it was not a mere accidental find. 

Mr. Ulke, in connection with Mr. Edwards' paper on the 
noises of Lepidoptera, mentioned that he had this season repeat 
edly heard the stridulating noise produced by Harpalus caligi- 
nosus in specimens attracted by electric lights. The noise ceased 
as soon as the specimens were caught. 

Mr. Schwarz corroborated Mr. Smith's statement made at the 
last meeting regarding the appearance of Cicada septcndecim in 
the northern part of the District. He had traced the species (from 
pupse skins adhering to trees) from Glenwood Cemetery around 
Soldiers' Home and across 7th-street Road, but did not see them 
in the woods bordering Rock Creek. The first Cicada pruinosa 
was heard this year on July 5. 

Mr. Schwarz read the following paper : 

SUDDEN SPREAD OF A NEW ENEMY TO CLOVER. 

By E. A. SCHWARZ. 

The sudden appearance of any species of insects in great number of 
specimens is always an interesting phenomenon. If such species was pre 
viously known to occur in the same locality, though as a rarity, we ex 
plain this appearance in numbers from the fact that the conditions, cli 
matic or otherwise, have been exceptionally favorable for its increase. 
But if a species suddenly appears abundantly in a locality in which it for 
merly did not occur in other words, if we have an invasion or a sudden 
migration of a species the reasons for such movements remain in most 
cases obscure. It is an example of this sort which has come under my 
observation within the spring and summer of this year, and which I would 
like to place on record. The insect in question is a Curculionid, Sitones 
kisfiidulus, a species introduced from Europe, but whose occurrence in 
North America has been known for quite a number of years. 

The genus Sttones contains a tolerably large number of palearctic species, 



OF WASHINGTON. 249 

which in the larva and imago states feed on clover, peas, Medicago, Meli- 
lotzis-, and allied plants, the beetles feeding on the leaves, the larvae under 
ground on the roots. They probably can also subsist on other plants be 
sides those mentioned. In our country we have on the Pacific coast a few 
species* which sufficiently deviate in characters to distinguish them from 
the European species. East of the Rocky Mountains the genus is repre 
sented by four species which are identical with European species. Three 
of them (S. lineellus, flavescens, and tibialis) are especially abundant in 
specimens in the more northern part of the country, and they are either old 
importations or belong more probably to the circumpolar fauna. At any 
rate, they have hitherto never done any serious damage here to clover, peas, 
or other cultivated plants, whereas in Europe several species of Sitones are 
greatly injurious. It is a well-known fact that if a Europea'n insect which 
is injurious to cultivated plants in its native home is introduced into North 
America, its injury here is by far more serious than in Europe. For this 
reason I am inclined to believe that these three species are not imported 
ones, but belong to the circumpolar fauna. The fourth species, 5. hisfli- 
dulus, is evidently a recent importation. Up to 1876 its occurrence in this 
country was not recorded. In that year it was first mentioned by Dr. Le- 
Conte as having occurred near Long Branch, N. J., about the roots of 
grass growing on the dunes. In subsequent years the species was found 
under similar conditions, on Long Island, N. Y., by the New York and 
Brooklyn entomologists; at Brigantine Beach, N. J., by Dr. Hamilton, and 
at Atlantic City and Cape May, N. J., by myself. Three years ago I found 
it at Piney Point, Md., also on the beach, but this year it has suddenly 
made its appearance in the city of Washington. In the spring I found 
two or three specimens on the walls of the Department of Agriculture, 
and in May Mr. Ulke found it swarming on red and white clover on the 
White House lot. At that time it was also common on red clover in the 
Agricultural grounds. Both Mr. Ulke and myself failed to find it in May 
and June in the surroundings of the city, although especial attention was 
paid to this insect. But in the middle of July I found some specimens at 
Bladensburg, Md., six miles from Washington, and in August Mr. Ulke 
found it on the mountains near Pen Mar, Pa. The beetle feeds on the 
leaves of clover, but does not appear to be so voracious as an allied species, 
Phytonomus puuctatus. A few larvae which I found underground feed 
ing on the roots of clover, are doubtless those of the Sitones. The effect 
of the work of the larva on the plant could not be ascertained from the 
fact that the lawns of our city parks are frequently mowed. 

Mr. C. G. H. Brischke tells us (Entomol. Monatsbl., I, 1876, p. 42) 
what amount of damage the larva is capable of doing to clover in its na 
tive home, and should the species continue its spread in this country it is 
to be feared that we shall have another most unwelcome addition to the 
already long list of clover pests. 



* Their number has recently been greatly increased by Capt. Casey, but 
it is doubtful whether most of his species will ever be recognized as such. 



250 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

In the discussion of this communication Mr. Ulke stated that 
he had found Sitones hispidulus in August of this year, at Pen 
Mar, Pa., and further, that this species was certainly not present 
in Washington last year, for he had repeatedly and industriously 
collected, without taking a single specimen, during last summer, 
on the lawns and clover fields where it was so abundant this year. 

Mr. Linell said that years ago he found the species abundantly 
on the beach at Coney Island, New York. 

As a further illustration of the sudden appearance of insects in 
new localities, Mr. Schwarz mentioned that Sphinx catalpce was 
this season, for the first time, excessively abundant in the District 
of Columbia, many trees within the city, but more especially along 
the Tennallytown road, being utterly denuded by the larva?. Mr. 
Schoenborn had informed him that the moth had been first observed 
here some 4 or 5 years ago at the electric light, and that a few 
larva? had been found every year since that time. 

Mr. Ulke, in the same connection, commented on the complete 
disappearance of Doryphora juncta, formerly a common species 
here, after the western species (D. \o-lineata} became abundant 
about Washington. 

Mr. Schwarz read the following note : 

AN INTERESTING FOOD-PLANT OF PIERIS RAP^E.*. In the latter part 
of July of the present year I had occasion to visit several points of the 
Atlantic coast in Virginia and New Jersey. The most common mari 
time plant all along this sandy coast is Cakile americana, of the family 
Crucifercz. At Virginia Beach, Va., and Cape May, N. J., I was sur 
prised to find the larva of the notorious Pieris rapcz feeding on this 
plant. Hundreds of specimens could have been collected within very short 
time. They were, however, not evenly distributed, but infested clusters of 
plants in different places, and occurred often where the plants were most 
exposed to the spray of the ocean. The larvae were of all sizes, and eggs 
and pupae were also found. For some reason or another no specimens 
were seen at Anglesea (a little north of Cape May), but I presume that the 
very low coast at that locality, where the maritime plants are often cov 
ered by the high tides, is the reason that the plants are not palatable to 
the insect. 

There is an interesting question connected with this food-plant of 



*This note was read before I had an opportunity of seeing part 8 of 
Scudder's great work on Butterflies, where Cakile americana is mentioned 
among the food-plants of Pieris rafife on the authority of Dr. John Ham 
ilton. 



OF WASHINGTON. 

Pieris rapce, viz., Has this Cakile, which is so abundant and widely dis 
tributed along our coast, been instrumental in assisting the spread of the 
butterfly ? Unfortunately this question can never be satisfactorily an 
swered, since we cannot ascertain whether this food-habit is a recently 
acquired one, or whether the Pieris took to the plant soon after its intro 
duction from Europe. I scrutinized Mr. Scudder's map accompanying his 
work on the introduction and spread of Pieris rapce to see whether the 
latter had spread faster along our sea-coast than inland. Mr. Scudder 
states that in the year 1869 the species was found in a narrow circle around 
New York city (not to mention here the localities in Canada and Maine). 
In the year 1870 we find it already from the north end of Long Island, 
through New Jersey and Delaware, into Maryland, but near the coast and 
not going far inland. In other words, it had spread within one year over 
a long stretch of the coast and a comparatively short distance inland. 
This would speak in favor of the theory that this maritime food-plant 
could have been instrumental in the rapid spread of the Pieris, but the data 
given by Scudder refer all to inland stations, where the insects spread by 
means of the cultivated cabbage, either from field to field or by transpor 
tation of infested cabbages. 

Mr. Ashmead stated that, in the year 1880, he had found the 
larvaB of Pieris rapcc feeding on Cakile marilima below 
Tampa, Fla. 

An exceptionally fine and large specimen of Lymexylon seri- 
ceum was exhibited by Mr. Schwarz, who called attention to the 
remarkable secondary male characters, viz., the flabellate maxil 
lary palpi. Several specimens of this beetle were cut from decay 
ing wood of Red Oak, near Washington, D. C., about the end of 
June ; others were found crawling on such trees after dusk. 



OCTOBER 3, 1889. 

Seven persons present President Schwarz in the chair. 

Mr. James Fletcher, of Ottawa, Can., was elected as a cor 
responding member of the Society. 

Dr. Fox showed two spiders in which the eyes were abnor 
mal. A male of Epeira sclopetaria had but seven eyes, the 
posterior median of the left side being absent ; otherwise the posi 
tion of the eyes was normal. The second specimen was a young 
female of Dictyna sp. In this the only eyes that could be made 



252 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

out were the four lateral and one posterior median, and all of 
these were unpigmented, and looked as if they were practically 
undeveloped. Traces of the other eye-spots were to be seen, 
however. In neither case could any scar be found to indicate the 
loss of the eyes from traumatism. 

Dr. Marx called attention to a mutilated specimen of Lycosa 
sp. which he had spoken of in a previous meeting of the Society. 
In this case the large eyes of the second row were wanting, but a 
cicatricial line was found, showing that they had been removed by 
a traumatism. 

Dr. Marx then read a letter from Prof. Thorell, in which the 
writer discussed the family terminations, idee and oidce, giving 
his decision in favor of the latter (oidce) . Dr. Marx called atten 
tion to the conflict of the two names Epeiroides (genus) and 
Epdroidce (family) which would occur in this case, and said 
that with the termination of idee for the family, these would be 
entirely distinct. 

After much discussion, participated in by all the members 
present, the unanimous opinion was in favor of the termination 
idee. 

Mr. Schwarz read the following letter from Dr. Geo. H. Horn,, 
of Philadelphia, in regard to the breeding habit of a rare Ceram- 
bycid : 

" Early last spring Mr. G. R. Pilate, of San Bernardino, Cal., sent me a 
lot of stems of Opuntia bernardina from southern California, containing 
living larvae of Ccenopceus Palmeri. One of these, with the stem and 'an 
imago, I sent to Dr. Hagen for certain preservation with his already large 
biological series. The other stems were allowed to remain in the box neg 
lected, knowing it would be useless to attempt to keep them green and 
growing. 

" On August 15 the box was opened again, and one very lively imago 
was found and four others dead or nearly so. 

"It is probable that the first emerged about August T. From this it is 
probable that in the much hotter climate of the Opuntia region the insect 
may be looked for a month earlier." 

Mr. Schwarz said that the food-habits of this species were very 
remarkable, since all other species of this group (Acant/wcinini] 
so far as known, live under bark of various kinds of dying or dead 
trees. The number of beetles known to bore in Opuntia stems is

very small (Monilema, Scyphophorus, Acalles hubbardi),\>\*\. 
future investigations will, no doubt, considerably increase the 
number. 

FLIGHT OF A GRASSHOPPER WHEN PURSUED. Some time in July of 
the present year there was witnessed by a great number of people, in 
cluding Mr. Pergande and myself, a curious and exciting sight, viz., a 
fight between two sparrows {Passer domesticus} and a grasshopper. On 
the lawn in front of the main entrance of the Department of Agriculture 
a specimen of CEdipoda Carolina rose into the air after the custom of this 
species, when it was espied and pounced upon by two sparrows. Instead 
of dropping to the ground the grasshopper remained on the wing, about 
10 or 12 feet from the ground, and flew across the lawn and across the 
road leading towards i2th street, its objective point being evidently the 
clump of pine trees near that road, and toward which it flew in as straight 
a line as it could under these trying circumstances. The whole distance 
of this flight was at least So feet. During all this time it was hotly pur 
sued by the two sparrows and had many narrow escapes, but finally 
managed to reach, the trees. 

The reason why I bring this little incident to your knowledge is to 
mention the clever way in which the grasshopper dodged the constant 
pouncing of the .sparrows. Although it evidently flew as fast as it 
possibly could, its flight was by far slower than that of the two sparrows 
in pursuit, who had no difficulty in repeatedly overtaking their intended 
victim. But just at ,the critical moments the grasshopper suddenly 
lowered or raised its flight for a foot or so, never deflecting to the right 
or left. I think that Orthoptera and Coleoptera generally are not 
capable of making sudden lateral movements while on the wing, whereas 
it is well known that in most Odonata and Heterocera and in many 
Hymenoptera and Diptera, such sudden lateral changes in the direction 
of the flight are executed with the greatest precision. 

To a swallow these sudden changes in the direction of the flight would 
have made no .difference whatever and it would no doubt have captured 
the grasshopper on the first or second sweep, but the sparrows were 
utterly unable to follow these movements quickly. That there were two 
sparrows in pursuit greatly added to the chances of the CEdipoda, for the 
birds greatly impeded each other, constantly colliding with each other 
and keeping up a loud and eager quarrelling during the whole duration 
of the chase. 

As stated before, the grasshopper finally succeeded in darting into one 
of the pine trees; the two sparrows flew around the tree, evidently in Ihe 
expectation of seeing the grasshopper emerge on the other side, but it 
did not, and thus ended this exciting race which was very creditable to 
the abilities of the grasshopper, but by no means so to the reputation of 
the sparrows as insect-catching birds.

I may add that the sympathies of the numerous spectators were wholly 
on the side of the grasshopper. 

A PECULIAR HABIT OF CHALYBION C^ERULEUM. This handsome steel- 
blue wasp of the family Sphecidce is quite common in summer and early fall 
in the parks and gardens of Washington. It stores its cells with spiders, 
but I do not know whether it selects only one particular species or 
several. At any rate, it seems to prefer a small, very common spider 
(? Dictyna}, which makes a loose and irregular web on hedges, windows, 
etc. The spider usually hides under a leaf, or twig, or projecting corner, 
and is rarely seen on the web itself. I have now noticed not only once, 
but repeatedly a pretty trick on the part of the wasp to secure its prey. 
It deliberately flies into the web of the spider, gets entangled, hangs 
down by its hind legs, flutters about; in short, acts like an insect that has 
been accidentally caught in the net. This last is, in many instances, not 
inhabited, and the wasp then disentangles itself without difficulty and 
flies away. If the net is inhabited the owner sallies forth from its hiding- 
place to look after the disturbance. Upon perceiving such a large insect 
in its web and possibly recognizing its deadly foe, the spider retreats as 
quickly as possible, but the wasp now knows where to look for it and 
easily captures it. 

During the discussion of predatory habits of different insects, 
Mr. Ashmead spoke of the peculiar habit of a Hymenopteron 
{Moncdula Carolina). It preys on the Horse-flies (Tabanus}. 
and often when driving he has seen this species keep ahead of the 
horse, flying backward all the time, and then make a dart and 
capture its prey from the horse's body.

headed, predatory fly of somewhat inferior size, belonging to the family 
Asilidce, and sub-family Dasypogonince. The head is unusually broad in 
front, the eyes being very prominent and presenting a spectacled or 
goggled appearance. My specimens were taken from July 24 to August 
19, either on leaves of plants in rather low situations, or on the wing. 
They agree well with Say's description, though the abdominal segments 
seem to be darker above in some specimens than there indicated. To 
Say's description the following might be added : The coxae are entirely ashy ;

the rest of the legs pale yellowish, with a dot at the extremity of the 
femora on the upper side ; the extremities of the tibize, especially the hind 
pair, and the lower portion of each joint of all the tarsi very dusky. The 
basal joint of the hind tarsi, which is as long as the three following 
joints put together, is furnished on the outer edge with a brush of fine, 
short hairs. This species occurs throughout the Atlantic States. 

Trichopoda radiata, Loew. The species of the genus Trichopoda are 
flower-flies. They belong to the first section {Phasina) of the Tachinidce. 
The species vary from rather small up to large and strikingly appearing 
flies, and are characterized, at least in all the specimens that I have seen, 
by having the upper edge of the hind tibiae ciliate. Only one specimen 
of the present species was collected, this one being taken August 19, on 
flowers ofjpemSy^y Mr. Marlatt. The pulvilli are remarkably developed, 
elongate, iind of a beautiful light honey-yellow color, each pulvillus bifid 
and apparently consisting of a prong and sheath joined at the base, giving 
the feet the appearance of having each four anthers, like those of certain 
grasses, sticking to them. The empodia are bristle-like and of nearly the 
same color. It is readily recognized by Loew's description, and is there 
recorded from the. District of Columbia. 

Trichopoda hirtipes, Fab. Two specimens, probably this species, were 
taken August 19, on flowers of mint and golden rod. They are very near 
to T. lanipes Fab., differing only in having the basal half or more of the 
abdomen and the bases of the femora rufous, while in lanipes the legs 
and abdomen are entirely black. This species bears the locality of 
Carolina in the O. S. list. 

Trichopoda ciliata, Fab. This is a smaller species, and the specimen 
which I have doubtfully referred here, the only one mentioned in these 
notes not from the Virginia side, was taken by Mr. Howard, at Clopper's 
Station, Maryland, August 4, on flowers of boneset. This species is 
recorded by Macquart from Carolina, and by Fabricius and Wiedemann 
from South America. 

Trichopoda sp. Another specimen, very much resembling the pre 
ceding, and of nearly the same size, but with the abdomen almost entirely 
light orange, while that of the preceding is well tipped with black, was 
taken August 19, on flowers of mint. 

Palloptera superba, Loew. This species belongs to the Lonchceidce, a 
small family comprising in North America only the two genera, Pallop 
tera and Lonchcea. It is a very pale-colored fly, with the wings prettily 
marked with smoky-black, and is found only in the shade of the woods, 
on the under side of leaves of various trees. I took four or five specimens 
from August n to 19, on under-side of lower leaves of oak and dogwood, 
about as high up from the ground as I could reach. They are not shy, 
but when disturbed are very quick in their movements. The species was 
described by Loew from specimens taken in Pennsylvania, and has been 
recorded for this vicinity by Glover. The only other N. A. representatives 
of this genus are two smaller species described l>y Loew from Sitka.

ON THE MIGRATIONS OF THE MILKWEED BUTTERFLY. 
By OTTO LUGGER. 

I have observed the Milkweed butterfly {Danais arckipptts) carefully for 
the last two seasons in Minnesota. In 1888 the spring was very late. I 
observed large numbers of these insects flying at St. Anthony Park on 
May 28. No traces of any milkweeds were visible at that time. All the 
specimens looked bleached and had but few scales upon their wings, which 
were almost transparent ; yet very few specimens had their wings torn in 
any way. They flew about rapidly, evidently in search of food, which at 
this time was scarce, consisting of the honey in the flowers of wild cherries 
and plums. On June 5 specimens had arrived at Perham, some two hun 
dred miles northwest of Minneapolis. Isolated specimens were observed 
there on June 3 and 4, but the butterflies were quite numerous a few days 
later, after which they disappeared. They also fed upon the honey of the 
cherries and plums. On June 17 I found numerous specimens in St. An 
thony Park in the act of mating, and found also three eggs upon the first 
small leaves of the Asclepias. On J une 24 I found numerous specimens at 
Fargo, Dakota, in the act of mating. In July, in Perham, very large num 
bers mating; in fact, but very few single butterflies could be found at this 
date. The males carry the females (or, perhaps, the other way) for a very 
long time. On July 18 larvae could be found everywhere upon the plants 
of Asclepias growing near Perham. 

The season of 1889 commenced early, and the butterflies arrived at Fer 
gus Falls (in the Red River Valley) as early as May 2, and they were seen 
mating on May 26. In this case also the butterflies followed the flowering 
season of wild cherries and plums. As soon as these flowers cease to 
bloom the insects disappear, but can be met with again farther north, where 
these plants are then just beginning to flower. 

I think the peculiar pockets in the hind wings of the males are not of 
any sexual importance, but serve another purpose. I frequently saw flying 



OF WASHINGTON. 257 

males during the mating season approach each other from a long dis 
tance, as could be observed easily on the prairies. As soon as they came 
within ten feet of each other they would immediately cease the chase- 
Evidently in this case each male had been notified by the odor produced 
in the pockets of the other that the desired interview would prove futile 
and useless. Two females, on the contrary, would chase each other for 
a very long time before reaching the same conclusion. As soon as the 
males recognized each other they invariably would fly away in different 
directions, and onlj r by the use of a gun could they be captured and their 
sex ascertained. 

The butterflies, in migrating south, do not fly singly, but in large num 
bers and together. Like swallows, they gather every night for several 
weeks in certain localities, and after thus becoming accustomed to swarm 
together, they utilize the first favorable wind to start upon their journey. 
On August 17, 1888, I found such a swarm near Detroit, Minn., and ob 
served more closely another one near Battle Lake a few days later. To 
study their motions, I camped for several days in this locality, which is a 
little grove of poplars near a very small creek. During the day but few- 
butterflies could be seen flying about in search of food. But towards sun 
set large numbers of them came from all points of the compass ;.nd settled 
upon the trees, selecting the crowns. As long as I could see, butterflies 
arrived, and millions of them must have crowded together. Early in the 
morning the butterflies commenced to leave this grove, not singly, but in 
large numbers, which broke up into smaller companies to scatter over the 
prairies in search of food. In this instance I am sure that the butterflies 
met every evening for at least ten days, but very likely for a longer period, 
as the wind during the period was from the south. With the first wind 
from the north all had disappeared. 

I also observed their motions at St. Anthony Park, but in this case they 
were already upon their southward journey. During some days with a 
wind blowing from the north, the air was filled with such butterflies. 
None flew at a distance above ground less than 250 feet, most of them very 
much higher. A good field-glass revealed large numbers at a much greater 
altitude, barely visible as mere spots with this instrument. Nor did the 
butterflies really fly, but they drifted or sailed along very rapidly with the 
wind. Their wings were fully extended in an almost horizontal position, 
and the insects seemed to use them only from time to time to keep their 
heads in the proper forward position. They flew both during the night 
and during the day. As soon as the wind changed its course all butterflies 
descended; it " rained butterflies," as my little boy called this phenom 
enon. Where no butterflies could be found for several weeks, everything 
was now alive with them. With their powerful wings they could be seen 
flying about everywhere, but I did not see a single specimen take food, 
although numerous thistles invited them. Sometimes the currents in 
higher layers of the air were in their favor, whilst those below were not. 
High in the air numerous butterflies sailed by, but those near the surface

of the earth tried in vain to reach their relatives. Late in September. 
1889, a small swarm of these insects was thus detained at the Park, and, 
as the nights were cool, they could be picked up frozen in the morning, 
but they would soon warm up and revive during the day to fly about, 
evidently waiting for an opportunity to escape to a more genial climate. 
Both in the spring of 1888 and 1889, the Danais butterflies were accom 
panied by the common thistle butterflies (Vanessa cardui). These came 
in as large numbers as the former, going northwards with the opening of 
the flowers of wild plum and cherries. Evidently these butterflies winter 
farther south, as all specimens were denuded of scales, indicating a long 
flight. Other hibernating insects, such as Vanessa antiopa, remain within 
the State. Their wings in spring are simply faded, but not denuded of 
scales. There is but one annual brood in Minnesota. 

Prof. Riley expressed himself as decidedly of the opinion that 
in Danais archippus there is but one annual brood. He de 
scribed the spring dispersion of the species northward, generally 
by isolated individuals, before the food-plant has appeared above 
ground. He had repeatedly observed these butterflies going 
against the wind in the spring, and always northward or north 
westward. He believes there is no real foundation for the theory 
of a hibernation in the northern portions of the country. 

In reply to a question, Mr. Lugger stated that these butterflies 
do not move in such regular swarms in the spring as in the fall. 

Dr. R. Thaxter said he had found the Archippus butterflies in 
immense number on the Gulf coast, in winter, generally in the 
pine woods, some groves harboring millions of specimens. He 
had seen them in coitu in both spring and fall, and also in Feb 
ruary, in Florida. During the winter they seem to feed but little, 
if at all. 

Mr. Howard remarked that he had noticed the migration of this 
butterfly in the middle of October, 1889, at Ithaca, N. Y. 

Mr. Lugger found them numerous in Baltimore in October, but 
they were nearly all frozen. 

Mr. Howard read the following paper :

By L. O. HOWARD. 

Mr. G. H. Verrall's recent paper on Bigot's orthography, in the Wiener 
Entomologische Zeitung for August, 1889, although of a controversial 
nature, has reminded me, in view of the fact that the names criticised

were contributed by M. Bigot to Scudder's Nomen. Zool., that it might be 
worth while to record a very few corrections which I have incidentally 
noted, and more especially as the first of the lo-year supplements to the 
Nomenclator promised by the Smithsonian ought soon to be under way. 
The omission of some of these genera is rather remarkable from their 
prominence, one of them in fact being the type of a family.

ABUNDANCE OF OAK-FEEDING LEPIDOPTEROUS LARV/K IN THE FALL OF 

1889. 

By C. L. MARLATT. 

The season of 1889 was apparently a most favorable one for Lepidopterous 
larvae in the District, as shown by the abundant finds on several collecting 
trips to the Virginia side of the Potomac and in the neighborhood of Cabin 
John's Bridge. Larvae were especially abundant during late summer and 
early fall, and while a few species predominated the variety was also un 
usually large. The result of an hour or so's collecting near Cabin John's 
Bridge on September 29, without the aid of net, umbrella, or any appliance, 
but simply by " hand-picking," may be given to illustrate the richness of 
the field, even late in the season. The list comprises merely Macro-Lepi- 
dopterous larvae, and is limited to those found on oak. In addition to 
those given, were found on oak two species of saw-fly larvce. Dipterous 
and Cynipid galls, and a considerable number of Micro-Lepidopterous 
larvae.

Dr. Thaxter, Mr. Lugger, and Mr. Schwarz corroborated Mr. 
Marlatt's experience regarding the great abundance of lepidopter- 
ous larvae in the fall of the present year. Mr. Ashmead said that 
caterpillars were very abundant in Florida in the fall, after a wet 
summer such as the present had been, but he also had noticed 
that they were almost invariably parasitized. 

Mr. Schwarz read a lengthy paper on " Caprification and Fig- 
insects," compiled from the works by Solms Laubach, Fritz 
Miiller, Paul Mayer, and Gustav Mayr. After giving defini 
tions of the terms " Caprification" and u Caprificus," and a short 
historical review of the subject, he proceeded to discuss the inter 
relations of the fig insects to the Caprifig and the true Fig-tree, 
under the following headings: i. The flowers and fruits of the 
caprifig and the wild species of Ficus ; 2. Enumeration of the Fig- 
insects ; 3. Life-history of the true Fig-insects (genus Blastophaga}, 
and fertilization of the wild species of Ficus and the Caprifig ; 4. 
The true Fig-tree, its differences from and its relations to the 
Caprifig, and the process of Caprification. 

Mr. Schwarz added his observations on Ficus aurea and its 
Fig-insects in semi-tropical Florida, and concluded with a few re 
marks regarding the practical application, to fig culture in the 
United States, of the results of these recent investigations on cap- 
rification.

ON THE FALL OCCURRENCE OF BIBIO AND DILOPHUS. 

By TYLER TOWNSEND. 

The flies of the genus Bibio are often very abundant in certain localities 
in the spring, appearing in swarms and covering all kinds of vegetation. 
The larvrc, which live in the earth and feed upon decaying vegetable mat- 



OF WASHINGTON. 261 

ter, occur in masses together, and this gregarious habit extends into the 
imago state. The flies are sluggish, and alight wherever they can find a 
suitable resting-place on grass or foliage, but, so far as I can learn, do no 
appreciable injury in any part of their existence, although some writers 
would have us believe that the larva? cause great destruction to the roots 
of grass. Bibio albipennis is probably the best known species in this coun 
try, and owes its notoriety to its peculiar habits and to the fact that it is 
distributed over the greater part of the eastern half of the United States. 
It is found from Massachusetts to Colorado. Indeed, it might almost be 
said to extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific, for the species described by 
Loew as hirtus, which is found in California, is so near to albipennis that 
it is manifestly only a form of that species modified by a long residence on 
the Pacific slope. B.femoratus is found from the Atlantic States to Michi 
gan and Kansas, but does not seem to occur in such abundance as does the 
first-named species. 

The object of this paper is to bring to the notice of the Society several 
records of the fall occurrence of Bibiomidte, to which my attention has 
been drawn more particularly by Prof. Lintner's notes on B. albipennis in 
his 2d New York Report, and to consider, in this regard, the question of 
their possible double-broodedness. 

I have gathered the following references to the literature on fall appear 
ances of Bibio : 

1818. Meigen : Systematische Beschreib., etc., vol. i, pp. 310, 317. 

1850. Zetterstedt : Diptera Scand., vol. ix, p. 3387. 

1856. Walker: Diptera Britann., vol. iii, pp. 137, 139. 

1869. Packard : Guide, etc., p. 392. 

1877. Siebke : Cat. Dipterorum Norvegize, p. 188. 

1884. Williston: Stand. Nat. Hist, vol. ii, p. 412. 

1885. Lintner: 2d New York Report, pp. 114-115. 

Touching American species, we have statements by the following au 
thors : 

Packard says that albipennis is " double-brooded and flies in swarms in 
June and October." He gives no details in this connection, but, replying 
to an inquiry, writes : "In regard to Bibio albipennis, I may say I have 
never reared the species, but must have made the statement in the Guide 
from seeing the swarms in June and September." 

Williston says virtually the same, stating that the flies of this species 
"are found in abundance on willows in early spring, but there is also 
another brood later in the season." 

In answer to a letter on this subject, Dr. Williston also wrote me : 

"It was impossible in my article to give credit for the different facts bor 
rowed. I have observed Bibio albipennis among the earliest flies of spring, 
and again in October. I therefore gave the statement, which you will find 
in Packard's Guide, feeling sure that it was true. You will understand 
that the whole article is really a statement of our existing knowledge of 



262 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 



flies, and for that very fact necessarily contains little that is strictly orig-* 
inal." 

Lintner, treating the same species, calls attention to Packard's state 
ment, adding that it is the only record known to him of the species occur 
ring in the fall, and that it has never come under 'his own observation at 
that time. Writing for information to Mr. E. L. Keen, of Philadelphia, he 
received the reply that Mr. Keen had never seen the species after July, but 
had taken " a few specimens of a small black species of Bibio* in a shel 
tered ravine " in October. 
In regard to European species : 

Meigen says that the time of appearance of these flies is, with the excep 
tion of Bibio clavipes, in the spring. Of that species he writes: "Very 
common in October and November on bushes. It is remarkable that, 
while all other Bibios known to me appear in the spring, this should make 
its first appearance in late autumn." Walker records it autumnal in 
Great Britain. 

Zetterstedt, in treating the Scandinavian species, makes clavipes the 
only exception to their spring and summer occurrence, and says that it is 
" very common on grasses and fruit tree foliage toward autumn (August- 
October) through all Scandinavia, the Lapland mountains excepted." 

Siebke, in his Diptera of Norway, says that clavipes occurs from June 
to September, which is a much earlier date than given by other authors. 
If these accounts are put together the dates would stretch from June to 
November, and allow the possibility of two appearances running into each 
other. 

The European pomonce is stated by Walker to be both vernal and au 
tumnal in Britain. Meigen, however, says that it occurs in June and July, 
while Siebke says June to August. 

As to fall occurrences of the nearly allied Dilophus, these have come 
more directly under my notice. On the yth of November, about noon, the 
day being bright and clear but somewhat chilly, I secured 13 specimens of 
Dilophus from the shady (north and east) sides of the Washington Mon 
ument, near its base. The sunny (south and west) sides of the shaft were 
first examined, with no other result than the discovery of specimens of the 
Cluster Fly {Pollenia rudis] and a few large Muscids, which seemed to 
be the only insects that could stand the glare of the sun on the smooth, 
white surface. These Dilophus were of two species. Eleven specimens, 
ten 9 9 an d one <^\ are near D.- se rotinus Loew; the others are two c^cJ 1 * 
entirely black and with the wings very dark smoky. Three specimens of 
a species very near the former, perhaps the same, were taken by Mr. Mar- 
latt in this vicinity on the 5th of May last. Therefore this species prob 
ably occurs both in spring and fall. 

As a last notice of specimens collected in the fall, I will mention that in 
the National Museum collections there are no less than 36 specimens of 

*This was probably a Dilophus. -T. T. 



OF WASHINGTON. 263 

'Dilophus, belonging to not more than two species, and all near D. sero- 
tinus, that bear labels of various dates in October, from the 8th to the 
24th, and were collected in Massachusetts and Missouri. Of these, 25 are 
9 ? and ii c^cT- The majority of the specimens are from Professor 
Riley's own collection, now in the National Museum. 

In regard to the length of time of transformation of these flies, so faras 
known, Meigen writes that the larvae " cast their skins at various times, 
pass the winter in the larva state, transform in the spring to pupae, 
from which in a few days the flies appear." Zetterstedt states that "the 
larvae of most of the species are said to live through the winter in dung 
and rich earth." 

It may be contended that fall appearances of these flies are due to trans 
formations of belated individuals, but this seems hardly credible, as we 
should in that event find them as numerous through the summer as in the 
fall. The more natural inference to be drawn from these facts is that 
species which are vernal and autumnal are double-brooded, although 
these fall appearances may be due to accelerated development. Of these 
species occurring both in the spring and fall, we have in America Bibio 
albipennis, Dilophus serottnus, and an undetermined species of Dilopkus. 



DECEMBER 5, 1889. 

Eleven persons present. President Schwarz in the chair. 

Prof. Riley presented a communication on the oviposition of 
Diptera in which he reviewed the subject of piercing ovipositors 
in different orders of insects. He stated that in the order Diptera 
they are very rare, and that it is a broad rule with but few ex 
ceptions, that when the Diptera in any way pierce or sting it is 
through modifications of the mouth-parts. In the Trypetidce* 
however, as also in some of the allied families of Ortalidce and 
Lonchceidce, the ovipositor is modified and fitted for puncturing, 
and he instanced cases like Trypeta pomonella and T. lugens in 
which the ovipositors were well adapted to piercing in the one 
case the apple, and the other case the orange, and placing their 
eggs in the fruit on the pulp of which the larvae live. 

Prof. Riley also presented a note on the genus Lestophonus, 
stating that upon receipt of fresh material from Mr. Frazer S. 
Crawford and some further notes from him, he had carefully gone 
over again the material in the National Museum collection and 
had concluded that Dr. Williston was wrong, and Mr. Skuse, 



264 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

tr 

\ 

of Australia, correct, in considering the L. monophlwbi distinct 
from L. iceryce, as species go. 

Prof. Riley also presented a communication on Dipterous larvae 
inhabiting man. After a general statement of the subject he re 
ferred more particularly to two unpublished cases of the occurrence 
of Eristalis larvae in the human rectum, and as havino- been 

* o 

passed living therefrom. One of the most explicit and trustworthy 
accounts is that of Dr. J. W. Compton, of Evansville,' Ind., of a 
case of larvae which were sent to the late Prof. Baird, and which 
were determined as those of Eristalis dimidiatus. The other 
case is one recently communicated by Dr. Lintner. The larvae 
proved to be those of Eristalis tenax. 

In connection with the " bullae " on the wings, mentioned by 
Prof. Riley, Mr. Ashmead said that Walsh had called attention 
thereto in the Hymenoptera and had considered them of impor 
tance, but that more recent writers had not followed him in this 
view. 

On the subject of Eristalis and other larvae in man there was 
much discussion. The opinion prevailed that these larvae could 
live for some time in the stomach, that they were probably taken in 
with food, or that the larvae came from eggs deposited on the anus 
and had then entered the rectum. 

Mr. Howard read a paper on the "European parasites of Ocneria 
dispar" of which he enumerated twenty-four species (among them 
one also known to inhabit North America) belonging to ten dif 
ferent genera. Of these he considers two to be probably hyper- 
parasites. Fernald's statement that there were eleven European 
parasites known is evidently taken from Ratzeburg. 

In the discussion it was mentioned that O. dispar was acci 
dentally introduced by Mr. Trouvelot, of Medford, Mass., about 
twenty years ago, but that it had not been noticed in numbers 
until this year. 

Mr. Ashmead exhibited a North American specimen of Hali- 
dea, and offered the following remarks : 

REMARKS ON THE CHALCID GENUS HALIDEA. 

By WM. H. ASHMEAD. 

The genus Halidea, the subject of my remarks to-night, was erected by 
Dr. Arnold Forster thirty-three years ago in his well-known work, Hy- 



OF WASHINGTON. 265 

menopterologische Studien, published in 1856, and in which but two spe 
cies are known, H. insignis and H. nobilt's, both found in Europe and 
described by Forster in : Eine Centurie neuer Hymenopteren. 

The genus was dedicated to the well-known Irish Hymenopterist, A. H. 
Haliday, and belongs in the group Eupelmince. 

For years I have been vainly endeavoring to recognize the genus, but, 
until recently, unsuccessfully, as I failed to find it either in my collections 
or amongst the numerous chalcideous material that has passed through 
my hands. 

Recently, however, in casually going over a miscellaneous collection of 
microhymenoptera, assorting it preparatory to identification, I was both 
delighted and gratified to recognize a single specimen of this rare genus, 
collected the past summer at Harper's Ferry, Virginia, by my good friend, 
the President of our Society, Mr. E. A. Schwarz, labeled as having been 
captured June 19, and which I have brought with me to-night. 

It superficially resembles an ordinary Eupelmus, the structure of the 
head, antennae, and thorax being nearly identical ; but it is at once distin 
guished from that genus and all other genera in the group by the dilated 
or broadly compressed posterior tibiae and tarsi a character that at once 
attracts attention, even on the most superficial examination. 

The middle legs are a little longer than usual, cylindrical throughout; 
the tibiae not dilated toward apex, nor is the first tarsal joint compressed 
and armed with teeth, as in other Eupelmids. The usual long apical 
tibial spur is, however, present, the thorax deeply impressed, as in Eupel- 
mus, while the abdomen is sessile, shorter, and more pointed. 

In testimony of my appreciation of the discovery, and as a slight token 
of my regard for the discoverer, I christen it in honor of our President 
and submit the following description : 

Halidea Sc/iwarzi, n. sp. 

Length. 2 mm.; bronzy-green, the face golden-green; head, broad, 
closely, minutely punctate ; antennae, 13-jointed, black; the scape, dull 
metallic green, its length being two-thirds the width between the eyes, 
slightly dilated apically; pedicel longer than wide; first two joints of 
funicle small, narrowed, cylindrical, but slightly longer than thick; the 
joints beyond dilated, nearly as wide as long, densely bristly ; the club 
obliquely truncate; eyes large, oval, occupying the larger portion of the 
sides of the head, finely pubescent; thorax more than twice as long as 
wide, densely scaly, the disk deeply impressed; metathorax short, the 
hind margin golden-green; legs brown, the anterior pair dusky, the tarsi 
one-third or more longer than the tibiae ; middle pair paler brown, longer, 
and cylindrical throughout, the tibial spur long and white; posterior pair 
brown-black, the tibiae and tarsi strongly dilated, pubescent; all coxae 
metallic green, the posterior pair being brighter and more of a golden 
color; abdomen sessile, acute ovate, not longer than the thorax, flat above, 
roundedly keeled beneath, bronzy-green, brighter beneath; ovipositor

short, only slightly exserted ; wings slightly subhyaline, pubescent, the 
veins pale brown ; the postmarginal vein is very long, gradually shaving 
off at apex of wing; the marginal less than twice as long as the stiginal 
vein. 

The question of an author's right to change his published gen 
eric or specific names was discussed. Dr. Forster, who intended 
to name the genus after Mr. Haliday, subsequently revised the 
name so as to read Halidaya instead of Halidea. Prof. Riley, 
Mr. Howard, and others held that, in this instance, the name was 
alterable, while Mr. Mann, Mr. Ash mead, and Dr. Fox held that 
a name once published should hold, unless there was a gross typo 
graphical error.

FURTHER NOTE ON DISSOSTEIRA ((EDIPODA) CAROLINA. 

By TYLER TOWNSEND. 

In the September number of the Can. Entom. for 1884 there appeared 
some notes by myself on the peculiar aerial performances of this locust, 
common throughout the U. S., and which Mr. Bruner tells me he has taken 
even in southern Mexico. The observations there given, as well as the 
present notes, were made in Michigan, and the latter being somewhat 
supplementary during two subsequent years are offered as follows : 

During August and September of 1885, while observing the actions of 
this locust, I noticed that when one individual was attracted by another's 
oscillations, it alighted on the ground beside it as soon as the latter had 
ceased its aerial performance, when they ran by each other several times 
in succession, but did not clasp, as I had observed them to do before. No 
further observations were made on the subject until the following year, so 
that up to this time I had never examined the sex of these individuals, but 
nevertheless believed them to be in all cases males. 

In 1886 the first performance of the season was noticed on July 27, the 
first specimen having been seen on July i. On August 7 a specimen cap 
tured in the oscillating act proved on examination to be a male. On Au 
gust 8 I had the opportunity of closely watching individuals as they went 
through their peculiar actions, when meeting on the ground, these actions 
being somewhat different from what I had previously noted. When two 
met on the ground, one having been attracted by the other's aerial exhibi 
tions, they passed closely by each other once, twice, and perhaps sev 
eral times, alternately jerking up and lowering the hind femora during 
the whole time, and more excitedly when nearest to each other. This 
continued for a few seconds, when one of the actors in the scene quickly 
flew up and away. I noticed these actions at this time in numerous cases 
without seeing any two thus engaged unite. On the other hand, I did not

see any in actual conflict, but was rather impressed with the idea that the 
participants had no warlike intentions during these actions. The speci 
mens were at this time nearly all males. 

On August 9 two specimens taken in the act of aerial oscillation were 
both males. Of two going through their actions on the ground, the one 
which flew away first was caught and found to be a male. The other es 
caped. The females were just beginning to appear at this date. 

The latest oscillations of the season were observed on October 10. There 
had been none noticed for nearly a month previous to this time, owing to 
the fact that the weather had been decidedly cold and with much rain. 
These last performances were due to the fact that for the preceding seven 
days the weather had, without exception, been warm and dry. 

My explanation of these actions is as follows : From the fact that only 
the males seem to take part in these aerial performances, I believe that 
they are at these times exhibiting their powers and graces in other words, 
paying court to the females. As these exhibitions attract other males, 
when the excited antics are indulged in on the ground, I imagine that each 
one is thereby trying to drive the other off the field, generally endeavoring 
to intimidate him,- and rarely actually clasping in conflict. This is to be 
inferred from the fact that the vanquished one soon flies away, leaving 
the other in possession of the field. There is little doubt that in some 
instances the males actually clasp and fight with each other; but more 
often one of them seems to be conquered without recourse to blows with 
draws before that point is reached. The females doubtless are in waiting 
in convenient spots, from which they witness these scenes, and ultimately 
accept the males whose superior intimidating powers have resulted in their 
being left in undisputed possession. 

Mr. Schwarz exhibited specimens of a Cerambycid beetle, 
Cyrtomerus pilicornis Fabr. (determined by Dr. Horn), a species 
hitherto not known from the United States. It occurs sparingly 
on the Island of Key West, Fla., where it infests the branches of 
felled or dying trees of Conocarpus erecta. The species is 
widely distributed in the tropical and semi-tropical regions of 
America.
