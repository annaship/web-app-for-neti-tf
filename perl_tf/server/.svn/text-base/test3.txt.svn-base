The lySth regular meeting was held in the Saengerbund Hall, 
3140 street, N.W., Dr. Howard in the chair, and Messrs. Ash- 
mead, Benton, Busck, Currie, Doolittle, Dyar, Gill, Heidemann, 
Kotinsky, Morris, Schwarz, Simpson, Ulke and Warner, mem 
bers, and Mr. H. Bolce, visitor, also present. 

Mr. H^ Bolce, of the Treasury Department, was elected an 
active member of the Society. 

Dr. Howard presented a note on a letter from Dr. Fletcher, 
wherein the latter reported black flies (Simulium colum- 
batczense Schoenbauer) entering the anus and vulva of domestic 
animals. 

Mr. Ashmead exhibited drawings to illustrate his mono 
graph of the North American Braconidae, soon to be published 
by the National Museum, and accompanied the exhibition by 
remarks illustrating the characters of the various genera "repre 
sented by these drawings. Among other things he said that in 
many instances he was led to detect generic and tribal characters 
by a knowledge of the habits of the insect. His notes were dis 
cussed by Messrs. Howard, Gill, Schwarz and Benton. 

Dr. Howard stated that in November, 1891, he read a paper 
before the Association of Economic Entomologists at Champaign, 



2 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

Illinois,* in which, in discussing the host relations of parasitic 
Hymenoptera, he advanced the idea that the classification of the 
group would undoubtedly be affected by a more accurate know 
ledge of host relations, and entered a plea for careful records. 
He was therefore greatly pleased to see from Mr. Ashmead's 
statements that the exact knowledge of habits, largely due to the 
work of Washington entomologists, had led Mr. Ashmead to 
discoveries affecting classification, thus justifying the 12-year-old 
prophecy. He referred especially to the new genus separated from 
Bracon to which Mr. Ashmead's attention had been called by 
the fact that all of the members were parasitic upon Cecido- 
myiidae instead of upon beetles, as is the general rule with the 
genus Bracon. 

Mr. Ashmead stated that he had discovered that the tribes of 
Cynipidae which he had erected correspond exactly with the 
groups of plants on which they make their galls, such as Quercub, 
Rosacese, Acacia, etc. ; and, on the other hand, from the nature 
of the host, he had been enabled to explain the differences in 
structure. 

Mr. Busck then read extracts from his paper on the generic 
name of the codling moth.t 

The paper was discussed by Messrs. Schwarz, Simpson, 
Howard, Dyar and Gill. 

Dr. Dyar mentioned a peculiar Lepidopterous larva which 
had been seen by several members of the Society at Plummer's 
Island, Maryland. It occurs only in spring. Mr. Barber 
brought in some last May (May, 1902), and the first moth had 
just emerged (April, 1903). The plant is Rhacelia dubia, ac 
cording to Mr. Morris ; the larvae live exposed on the plant and 
are brightly colored. The moth that emerged is not well 
developed and the color seems grayer than normal, but other 
wise it agrees exactly with specimens of Ethmia zellericlla 
Chambers, from Texas. The following description of the larva 
was handed to the Secretary for publication :

Dr. Dyar presented also a description of the larva of Lito- 
donta hydromeli. Mr. Schwarz had found the larva again, this 
time in Key West, Florida, and he brought home two examples, 
which have been nicely inflated for the collection by Mr. Cau- 
dell. They were feeding on Bumelia angustifolia.

the center of the segments. In the narrow form it stops at the end ot 
joint 10 and is continued by the shadow of a pale dorsal line; in the 
broad form a diminishing dark purple stripe runs to the anal plate. On 
the thorax subdorsal and lateral fine faint yellow lines, which become 
broken into obliques on the abdomen, running from subdorsal anterior on

Dr. Dyar mentioned another result of Mr. Schwarz's brief 
stop at Key West, namely, the determination of the food plant 
of Mieza igninix Walker. These larvae were found on the 
Bumelia august if oli a with the Litodonta larva, and a moth 
has just emerged. According to Dr. Dyar this is undoubtedly 
the same plant on which Mrs. Slosson originally found the 
species, but it was unidentified then and has remained so till 
now.* It might be well, he said, to note that the figure of 
Abbot identified by Packard t *s>-Eustixia pupttla Hiibn., really 
represents this Mieza. 

The following paper, by Mr. Caudell, was then read by the 
Secretary :

BRANCHED HAIRS OF HYMENOPTERA. 
By A. N. CAUDELL. 

Several years ago, in an attempt to determine which of our 
Hymenoptera possess branched hairs, I examined almost two 
hundred species, including representatives of all the families. Of 
these species twenty-three only possessed branched hairs, the 
others having only simple ones, which, in some cases, were 
spirally twisted. Without exception the twenty-three species 
bearing branched hairs proved to belong to the group Antho- 
phila, or pollen-gatherers, and no representative of this group 
was found without such hairs. Thus the possession of branched 
hairs seems a good character for the separation of the Antho- 
phila from the remainder of the Hymenoptera. This character 
has indeed been used by some writers. 

Of the Anthophila somewhat critical studies of the hairs from 
various portions of the body were made for the purpose of learn 
ing the distribution of the various forms, and at which portion 
of the body they were the most often found. Characters among 
the hairs for the subdivision of the group were also sought for. 

It has generally been stated that branched hairs are found 
especially on those portions of the insect's body that are used in 
gathering pollen. In my investigations I examined hairs from 
the head, dorsal surface of the thorax, dorsal and ventral sur 
faces of the abdomen, posterior tibiae and basal segment of the 
posterior tarsus. I found that of these six regions the dorsal 
surface of the thorax alone possesses branched hairs as a constant 
character. The thorax must, therefore, be considered the typical 
branched-hair bearing region, as it is the only place where such 
hairs are found to be always present. If exceptions should be 
found to occur here also upon further investigation, is not known. 

The invariable presence of branched hairs on the top of the 
thorax seems a wise providence of nature for facilitating the 
cross fertilization of plants. 

In regard to finding hair characters for the subdivision of the 
Anthophila I met with no success. While the forms of hairs 
vary from one- to many-barbed and from short serrations to 
long branches, the various kinds are distributed among the 
genera in such a manner as to be, apparently, of no systematic 
importance. The hairs of closely related genera, as Bombus 
and Psithyrus, present no characters for their separation or for 
the separation of such genera from ones remotely related. Nor 
do the hairs of the Andrenidae seem to differ from those of the 
ApidaB any more than they do as between different genera. 

This subject seems to have received less study than its interest 



6 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

appears to warrant. The main, and almost the only article of 
any length, based upon original research, so far as I can find, is 
by Edward Saunders in the Transactions Entomological Society of 
London for 1878. This author examined the hairs of one or 
more species of almost all the genera of British Aculeate Hyme- 
noptera, but none of the Terebrantia. He found that, without 
exception, members of the Anthophila alone possessed branched 
or plumose hairs, and he later used that character in classifica 
tion. 

As to the use of these branched hairs there seems to be con 
siderable doubt. Mr. Saunders suggests that they are of use in 
gathering pollen. As they are characteristic of pollen-gathering 
groups they are, doubtless, of use in that connection, but that 
their only use is for gathering pollen is not proved. If such 
were the case we would scarcely expect to find branched hairs 
present on parasitic species, such as those of the genus Nomada, 
or absent from the special pollen-collecting portions of the body 
of some pollenizing species, such as the posterior tarsus of the 
honey bee. But Coburn states that the explanation of these hairs 
being pollen-collecting hairs is so plausible as to exclude all other 
hypotheses. The same author mentions the members of the genera 
Ceratina and Prosopis as being without hairs. This is disputed 
by Saunders, who claims that .they do possess a few hairs which 
retain the character of being branched. 

Besides Saunders and Coburn the presence of branched or 
plumose hairs in the Hymenoptera has been mentioned by Reau 
mur, Smith, Dimmock and others, but the article by Saunders 
seems to be the only one of considerable length or importance. 
Dimmock has given an interesting discussion of the scales of 
Coleoptera in Psyche for 1883. He found, as previously pointed 
out by Fisher, that branched scales or hairs occur only in the 
Scarabasida?. 



Mr. Benton said that the branched and twisted hairs on the 
thorax of bees are necessary for collecting pollen, as the bees 
twist and turn ; whereas the hairs on the legs are used only 
for combing and brushing that pollen off. 

Dr. Dyar called attention to the different dates of hatching 
of hibernated mosquito eggs according to the species. Eggs of 
Culex canadensis and Culex atropalpus had hatched in March, 
while those of Culex triseriatus were just hatching then (mid 
dle of. May). These eggs had been deposited at various dates 
during the summer of 1902. 



OF WASHINGTON. 7 

Dr. Howard related an interesting case in which mosquitoes 
had been made the subject of a law-suit. There was an outbreak 
of malaria in Greensboro, N. C., which was attributed to Anoph 
eles breeding in a mill pond owned by Cone Bros., of that 
place. An injunction was sought against these gentlemen, by 
the State board of health, to restrain them from maintaining the 
dam and pond. To abolish this would have entailed the ruin of 
the community. Cone Bros., therefore, engaged expert entomolo 
gists, among whom were the narrator and Mr. F. C. Pratt, who 
demonstrated that while Anopheles was breeding in every pool in 
and about the village, not a single larva was to be found in the mill 
pond. Upon a question from Mr. Benton, Dr. Howard explained 
that this was partly because the water surface of the mill pond was 
so large as to be constantly disturbed by rain and wind, rendering 
it unsuitable for the breeding of mosquitoes. Cone Bros, further 
offered prizes of $50 to the physicians of the village, some 13 
in number, for every Anopheles larva they could find in the 
pond. Only one of them succeeded in finding a dilapidated 
Anopheles larva, for which he duly received his prize. Six of 
these physicians then served as witnesses for the defendant, and the 
case ultimately grew so strong against the State that it was dis 
missed. 

Mr. Schwarz stated that on his return from Cuba he stopped 
for a short time at Key West, Fla., to collect certain Scolytid 
beetles which he discovered there in 1887. To his sorrow he 
found that all the fig-trees, mastic-trees and various other tropical 
trees had been cut down and Scolytids had disappeared from the 
island. Some other interesting insects were found, however. 
For some years a flowering tree of large size ( Cordia sebestana] 
had been introduced into the gardens of Key West, and the leaves 
of this tree were being devoured by a large Cassidid beetle (Eury- 
peplajamaicensis Linnaeus) , Which has hitherto not been noticed 
from the United States. Both the plant and the beetle are now 
thoroughly acclimatized in Key West. All over the island of 
Cuba blossoms of the cultivated egg-plant were infested by a 
little weevil (Anthonomus varipes Duval). The original wild 
food-plant of the species was found to be an arborescent solana- 
ceous plant (Solatium torvum) . This same weed had of late 



8 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

years invaded the tropical parts of Florida, and the same Antho- 
nomus was found in abundance on Key West. The same beetle 
had been collected previously by Mrs. A. T. Slosson at Miami, 
but the species was not properly recognized at that time. 

Mr. Schwarz exhibited, also, leaves of the Indian Laurel 
{Fic2is indica}, which is planted extensively both in Cuba and 
on Key West as a shade tree. On all the trees examined the 
leaves of the terminal twigs were found to be tightly rolled up, 
so that it appeared as if those twigs were dead and destitute of 
leaves. The author of this mischief proved to be a species of 
Phloeotkrips (named by Mr. T. Pergande), and observations 
showed that a number of females congregate on the upper side 
of the leaves to deposit their eggs, whereupon the latter begin to 
curl up. Mr. Schwarz stated that he was not aware that any 
species of Thripidae with such social habits was referred to in 
the literature. 

Mr. Currie then read a note, by Mr. Caudell, on "The 
Blattid Fauna of the World." The author stated that he had 
just completed a catalogue of the cockroaches of the entire world, 
with the intention of having it published, together with cata 
logues of the other non-saltatorial families of Orthoptera. He 
found, however, that the same work was being done by W. F. 
Kirby, of the British Museum. Better facilities for such work, 
in the way of more complete collections and literature, were found 
in England, and so he had given over the thought of publishing. 
As worked out in a manuscript catalogue, the Blattid Fauna of 
the World results as follows: Of genera there are 222 de 
scribed, 33 of which are synonyms, leaving 189 valid. Of 
described species there are 1,886, 202 being synonyms, leaving 
1,684 gd species. 

Mr. Heidemann read a note and exhibited drawings of the 
genitalia of Podisus cyntcusSay, and P. bracteatus Fitch, and 
called attention to the important differences between these two 
species. He has presented for publication the following paper 
on the subject : 



OF WASHINGTON. 



REMARKS ON THE GENITALIA OF PODISUS CYNICUS SAY 
AND PODISUS BRACTEATUS FITCH. 

By OTTO HEIDEMANN. 

Mr. A. N. Caudell read a paper* " Some Insects from the 
Summit of Pike's Peak, Found on Snow" before the Entomo 
logical Society, of Washington, February 13, 1902. The insects 
were collected by him and the specimens of the order Hemiptera 
were turned over to me for determination. In his paper I have 
given the following account in referring to numerous specimens 
of the species Podisus cynicus Say : 

"Twelve adults, males and females. Six of these specimens 
evidently belong to another species, probably Podisus bracteatus 
Fitch. This species is considered by some American authors as 
synonymous with Podisus cynicus Say. But the writer has 
lately had occasion to examine Fitch's type-specimen, a female 
(U. S. Nat. Mus.), and to compare the same with specimens of 
P. cynicus Say, and there seems to him no doubt that P. brac 
teatus Fitch will have to stand as a separate species. The 
female genitalia are decidedly distinct in these two forms; there 
are also differences in the shape of the bodv, which in P. brac 
teatus is comparatively broader and shorter. However, more 
material from other localities will have to be examined, and 
especially the male characters, before a definite conclusion can 
be reached." 

Since then I have had the opportunity of examining many 
more specimens from different localities, and have found that the 
male genitalia also are very distinct in these two species. This 
character is evidently of most importance in separating the species 
of the genus Podisus. because all the other characters formerly 
used, such as the shape of pronotum, the punctures and colors, 
are not constant in the specimens. The accompanying drawing 
(Fig. i) will show more decidedly the differences between these 
two species. 

In Podisiis cynicus, female (A, 2), the inner margins of the 
side pieces of the first genital segment are cut straight, giving the 
middle plate a square appearance ; while in P. bracteatus, on 
the contrary (B, 2), these margins are obliquely formed, making 
the middle plate distinctly triangular. The male genitalia differ 
still more, as may be readily observed in the drawing. The 
ventral terminal segment of the abdomen forms quite a deep 
cavity, from which a kind of clasper protrudes on both sides of 
the cavity, termed by Dr. D. Sharp "the superior lateral pro-

male (A, i), this process is short, comparatively broad and rather 
flat ; but in the other species (B, i), it is peculiarly twisted from 
the base, narrow and more acutely pointed. Directly underneath 
these parts, also, a pair of so-called lateral appendages extend 
straight forward, which in P. cynicus are short and club-like in 
shape. P. bracteatus, on the contrary, has these appendages 
very long, reaching the outer edge of the cavity, and cylindrical 
in form. In the middle of the cavity there is another piece, the 
rectal cauda, covering the inner organs of the genitalia. To 
bring out these inner parts would need careful dissection. Any 
how, the shape of the exterior parts, the superior lateral processes 
and the lateral appendages furnish sufficient characters for dis 
tinguishing Podisus cynicus Say at once from Podisus brac- 
teatus Fitch.

Mr. Simpson exhibited a collection made by Mr. Caudell of 
miscellaneous insects caught on the sticky secretions of the moun 
tain laurel (Ka/mia latifolia). He also showed specimens of 
dead branches of apple trees that were once infested by codling 
moth pupae, and which were made a point of attack by wood 
peckers. 



JUNE 18, 1903. 

The 1 79th regular meeting was held at the residence of Dr. 
C. W. Stiles, 1718 Q^ street N.W. Vice-President Banks in 
the chair, and Messrs. Dodge, Gill, Heidemann, Kotinsky, Mar- 
latt, Patten and Stiles, members, and Mr. Grayton Ransom, 
visitor, also present. 

Mr. Grayton Ransom, of the Bureau of Animal Industry, 
U. S. Department of Agriculture, was elected an active member 
of the Society. 

Dr. Stiles moved that the congratulations of the Society be 
telegraphed to Mr. Ash mead at Pittsburg, in view of the fact 
that the doctorate was to be conferred upon him on that date by 
the Western University of Pennsylvania. The motion was unani 
mously carried, and Dr. Stiles was asked to word and send the 
telegram. 

Mr. Schwarz exhibited a specimen of the Curculionid beetle 
Hormo'ps abducens LeConte, which he collected at Plummer's 
Island, Maryland, in May, and which is a new accession to the 
fauna of the District. Only one specimen of this species was 
previously recorded, found by Hubbard and Schwarz at Capron, 
Fla. 

Dr. Gill asked Mr. Schwarz whether the larvae of Calandrid 
beetles were used as food on the island of Cuba. Mr. Schwarz 
replied that to his knowledge they were not so used in Cuba. 

Mr. Heidemann exhibited a male specimen of Aradus qtiad* 
rilineatus Say, which he found in a decaying trunk. In his col 
lection he had specimens from Canada and from Cleveland, Ohio, 
and also one specimen coming from Georgia. He exhibited also 
a specimen of Aradus robustus Uhler, which he had usually ob 
tained by beating trees, but last week he found an old trunk of 



12 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

Gleditschia triacanthus, in the crevices of the bark of which 
he found a number of specimens of this species. He further 
stated that in the collection of insects made by Mr. Franklin 
Sherman, Jr., in North Carolina, he found a Reduviid belonging 
to the sub-family Stenopodinae, near the genus Gnathoblcda, 
which Champion described and figured as Schumannia mexi- 
cana, in The Biologia Central!- Americana. The description was 
based on one specimen which came from Vera Cruz, Mexico, and it 
was remarkable, he said, that this same species should have been 
found in North Carolina. The genus is distinguished by the 
narrow thorax and the strong, long spines on the trochanter. 

Mr. Schwarz stated that he had a list of the injurious in 
sects of Cuba as observed by him this spring. The champion 
of all injurious insects there is Atta cephalotes, the leaf-cutting 
ant. The next place, however, should be given to a species of 
myriapod, which plays there the role of our cutworms. It eats 
and injures anything that is cultivated, such as strawberry, cab 
bage, egg-plant, young orange trees, etc. Where he had been 
called to find the cause of injury to cultivated vegetation, he had 
always found this pest to be the author of it. Mr. O. F. Cook 
identified it as Orthomorpha coarctata Saussure, a species 
which, Mr. Cook stated, probably came originally from the 
East Indies. The only remedy that Mr. Schwarz could sug 
gest against these pests was to put ashes or tobacco dust sweepings 
upon the ground. He found these creatures especially abundant 
after a rain. 

Mr. Dodge then presented his paper entitled " Gloveriana." 
He stated that 15 years ago he had published Townend Glover's 
biography.* The information for this he had gathered from a 
scrap-book, which was made up of MS. notes and plates made by 
Glover. He gave the stages of evolution in the making of 
Glover's plates, which were at first of pocket size and of in 
sects only, so that they might be conveniently carried in a pocket 
notebook. Later he determined to have drawings of the plants 
infested to accompany those of the insects, and later still he had 
thought of undertaking to publish and illustrate the insect fauna 
of the entire United States. Mr. Dodge exhibited these scrap-

OF WASHINGTON. 1 3 

books, containing drawings that were made as long ago as 1850, 
and a letter that T. W. Harris at one time wrote to Glover pro 
posing that they work together. 

Upon a question from Mr. Schwarz, Dr. Gill stated that 
Glover's works should be regarded as publications, because they 
were put in permanent condition and copyrighted. Mr. Dodge 
stated that fifteen complete sets were issued and distributed to 
institutions and individuals. Prof. Glover commenced with the 
Orthoptera and then followed with the Diptera and the Hete- 
roptera. Mr. Schwarz stated that Glover's works were not 
recognized as publications, and Dr. Dyar had correctly omitted 
them from his catalogue. Mr. Dodge replied that Dr. Hagen 
recognized them as publications. Mr. Schwarz stated that 
Glover named but one insect during his lifetime, and this species, 
Psylla nigripennis, he named only by accident. Dr. Gill re 
called that at one time Glover had asked him to take up the study 
of spiders. Upon a question from Mr. Schwarz as to what be 
came of the specimens from which Glover made his drawings, 
Mr. Dodge replied that Glover had no use for specimens after he 
had drawn them. Glover refused absolutely to use any ade 
quately prepared material for his work ; besides, many speci 
mens came from collectors, and were returned to them. Mr. 
Schwarz said that he could still recognize some of Glover's 
specimens in the old collection of the United States National 
Museum. 

Mr. Schwarz then read the following : 

THE COTTON-BOLL WEEVIL IN CUBA. 

(Anthonomus grandis Boheman.) 

By E. A. SCHWARZ. 

Many years ago Dr. Juan Gundlach found Anthonomus 
grandis in Cuba, in the central portion, near Cardenas, and in 
the western. portion, near San Cristobal, but no information on 
its mode of life or food-plant was furnished by him. In the year 
1892 Mr. Eduardo Ferrer, one of the most prominent agri 
culturists of Cuba, planted at Cayamas, in the southern portion 
of the province of Sta. Clara, two small fields of Egyptian 
cotton, the two fields being about two miles distant from each 
other. One of these was attacked by the Anthonomus as soon 



14 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

as the plants commenced to produce squares, and not a single 
pound of cotton has been harvested from this field. During this 
time the second field remained intact and produced a large 
amount of cotton, until about five months later (December, 1892), 
when the weevil infested this field,, too, and before the middle of 
February the plants had ceased to produce bolls or even flowers, 
the weevils infesting and destroying every square that made its 
appearance. 

Toward the end of February the writer was commissioned by 
Dr. L. O. Howard to proceed to Cayamas, Cuba, in order to find 
out, if possible, the original food-plant of the Anthonomus, a 
point in the natural history of the insect which had hitherto re 
mained unknown. Up to the time of my visit to Cuba I had 
shared in the opinion held by many entomologists connected with 
the Boll-weevil investigation, that the original food-plant of the 
weevil would prove to be some Malvaceous plant generically dif 
ferent from Gossypium ; accordingly, some time was at first 
spent by me at Cayamas in investigating every Malvaceous 
plant,* although with no success. 

Previous to my arrival, and as soon as the weevils infested his 
cultivated cotton, Mr. Ferrer had examined the wild cotton plants 
growing in the vicinity of his cultivated fields, but without find 
ing any trace of the insect. As a matter of course, the very first 
thing I did upon my arrival on the spot was to closely re-examine 
these plants, but they proved to be free from weevils. However, 
soon afterwards the insect was found breeding on wild cotton in 
many places around Cayamas. 

There are two distinct species of wild cotton in Cuba, both 
of them arborescent and perennial plants, which, if undisturbed, 
attain a great age. Even when growing among the dense, tall 
grasses and weeds they reach a height of from eight to ten feet, 
and, when growing under more favorable conditions, are often 
fifteen or more feet in height. The species never intergrade with 
each other, although they are difficult to distinguish without ex 
amination of the ripe bolls. 

The first of these species is called by the Cubans the " Loose " 
or "Wild" cotton, " algodcn sylvestre." It isprobably the Gossyp 
ium brasiliense of the botanists. In general appearance, and 
in the arrangement and nature of the seeds, it greatly resembles 
our sea-island cotton, but is very much taller and has a shorter 

*The youngand more succulent fruits ofa species of Malvastrum showed 
holes exactly corresponding in size with the punctures of the Antho 
nomus, but thev proved to be made by the larva of a Microlepidopteron 
(the particular species has not been bred), which feeds on the undeveloped 
seeds.

fiber. A number of varieties of this species occur, some of 
which, if properly cultivated, would no doubt be of considerable 
commercial value. 

The second species, the "kidney" cotton, or " algodon de 
vinon," of the Cubans, is extremely distinct from the fact that 
the seeds are consolidated into kidney-shaped masses. The 
species is not variable, and manifestly represents an ancient type 
unchanged by the hand of man. It is, at present time, without 
commercial value since the fiber cannot be ginned by any ma 
chinery now in use. 

Neither species is exactly what we would call a wild plant, for, 
since prehistoric times, the natives have taken care of the plants, 
and have used the fiber for all sorts of domestic purposes. At 
present the Cubans living either in the suburbs of the cities or 
in the open country usually have one or two, rarely more, cotton 
trees planted in their yards or gardens ; but many plants, usually in 
groups of several specimens each, may be found in the less in 
habited parts of the island remote from any human habitation. 
The present natives know the exact location of every cotton plant 
in their vicinity, although apparently growing perfectly wild. Mr. 
Ferrer informs me, however, that in such instances there was 
probably a hut or a settlement on the place in former times. 

In the province of Sta. Clara both species of wild cotton occur 
in about equal numbers, while in the vicinity of Havana the loose 
cotton prevails, and the kidney cotton is met with in exceptional 
instances only. 

The following is a short summary of the examination made 
by Mr. Ferrer and myself of every wild cotton plant growing 
within easy reach around Cayamas. We had also the kind assist 
ance of several planters who took an interest in this subject. 
Finally, a man was hired and trained, who visited, within a fort 
night, about 90 more remote localities, bringing samples of in 
fested squares or bolls of every wild cotton plant he met with. 

Anthonomus grandis is never common, usually rare, on the 
wild cotton plants, and is never appreciably injurious to them. 
To find ten, or even less, infested squares or bolls on a large- 
sized tree requires considerable time, even for an experienced 
field entomologist. Solitary plants are usually free from weevils 
while small groups of plants are occasionally free. In a single 
instance, a patch of about 50 plants of kidney cotton was found 
remote from any house, and here the weevils were more numer 
ous than elsewhere. I calculated that about one square* out of 
fifteen was infested, which percentage, however, did not prevent 
the plants from being covered with healthy flowers and bolls. 

*On the wild cotton of Cuba, the Anthonomus prefers the squares to the 
bolls for the purpose of oviposition. 



16 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

The kidney cotton is much preferred by the Anthonomus to 
the loose cotton. In fact, trees of the latter species, if growing 
by themselves, are, as a rule, not infested,* whereas if they 
grow in close proximity to the kidney cotton they are liable to 
infestation, although always in a lesser degree than the kidney 
cotton. 

From these observations I firmly believe that, as far as Cuba 
is concerned, the kidney cotton is the original food-plant of the 
weevil. Furthermore, I do not hesitate to assert, after my 
experience in Cuba, that Anthonomus grandis, wherever it 
occurs, has no other food-plants than the various species or vari 
eties of the genus Gossypium. The few scattered notes that Dr. 
Howard has been able to obtain regarding the boll-weevil in the 
more tropical parts of Central America appear to corroborate the 
conclusions obtained in Cuba. 

Whether Anthonomus grandis and its food-plant are natives 
of Cuba, or whether both have, in ancient times, been imported 
from the Central American continent, is a question the answer to 
which seems to be lost in antiquity. 

In the cotton belts of Texas and Northern Mexico by far the 
largest number of the weevils perish, from various causes, during 
the cold season. Only a few successfully hibernate, and form, 
in the ensuing spring, the nucleus of a new set of generations, 
the weevils increasing in numbers until late in the fall. The 
mild winter temperature of Cuba, however, does not prevent the 
cotton plants from producing new squares, flowers, or bolls, nor 
the Anthonomus from breeding. As to the plant's of the culti 
vated cotton in Cuba, some retardation in growth is noticeable 
during the colder months, and the number of weevils upon them 
is then lessened from the inability of the plants to produce suffi 
cient food supply. But the wild cotton plants of Cuba are in no 
way affected by the colder weather ; nevertheless, the weevils 
have never been known, either in winter or summer time, to be 
come numerous enough to prevent these plants from copiously 
flowering or ripening their bolls ; whereas, as stated above, the 
effect of the attack of the weevil on cultivated cotton resulted, 
within a few weeks, in the complete disappearance of flowers 
and bolls. The same phenomenon has been observed in many 
other species of insects which are not, or but little, injurious to 
their original food-plants, but which, when transferred to the 
same or an allied plant under cultivation, become very destructive. 

To the question of parasites of the boll-weevil much attention 
was paid by me while in Cuba, but upon opening many hundreds 

* It is probably for this reason that I failed to find the weevil in the 
vicinity of Havana. 



OF WASHINGTON. 17 

of infested squares or bolls I never saw the slightest trace of a 
parasite. From the cultivated fields about 400 infested squares 
were collected and a correspondingly large number of weevils 
were bred from them, but not a single specimen of a parasite was 
obtained. 

The above notes are abstracted from my letters written to Dr. 
Howard. 

In the discussion Mr. Banks suggested that the loose cotton 
might have been the original food plant, because it is less injured, 
which is usually the case with abandoned food plants ; to which 
Mr. Schwarz replied that this may be correct, if proven. He 
further stated that the Gossypium brasiliense is probably also 
found in South America, yet Koebele never found a specimen of 
the weevil when he explored the cotton regions near Bahia and 
Pernambuco. The distribution of the insect shows it to be of 
Central American origin. Mr. Marlatt stated that it would be 
of great interest to know whether these cottons are immune to 
weevil. At present they are scattered, there being but few plants 
grown on a large area, and therefore they are not more seriously 
infested ; but he wondered if the habits of the insect would not 
change were these plants grown on a large scale. He thought 
that the chances were rather in favor of it since, where plants 
are more abundant, the insect is found in proportionately larger 
numbers. This was further discussed by Messrs. Gill and Dodge. 
Mr. Schw r arz stated that his host, Mr. Ferrer, of Cayamas, had 
published a series of important articles in the " Diario de la 
Marina," of Havana, Cuba (issues of March 21 to March 27, 
1903), on the history of cotton and on cotton cultivation in Cuba, 
which included a chapter on the boll-weevil.

NOTE ON THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE RED FORMS OF 

DIACRISIA. 

By HARRISON G. DYAR. 

We have recognized, heretofore two species of Diacrisia from 
the West, rubra Neumcegen and vagans Boisduval. There ex 
ists a third in the mountains about Kootenay Lake, which I would 
distinguish as D '. kasloa in the following synoptic form : 

(^ smaller than 9 the wings thinly scaled and somewhat transparent. 

(^ blackish or red, 9 brownish red, hind wings dark rubra. 

(^ as large as 9> the wings thickly scaled. 

$ light mouse gray or blackish; 9 re ^ brown vag-ans. 

cf and 9 alike, bright red kasloa. 

Diacrisia kasloa, n. sp. 

$ with the thorax and fore wings dark red brown to bright crimson, 
marked by a few dusky scales, indicating discal dot and outer line; hind 
wings black, veins and fringe more or less broadly reddish. 

9 deep crimson, the fore wings scarcely marked ; hind wings black on 
basal five-sixths or the black reduced to discal dot, broken submarginal 
band and shading along inner margin. Size and shape of vagans. 

D. vagans occurs in California and extends much to the East. I 
have typical examples from Rossland, B. C., not very far from 
Kootenay Lake. At Kaslo, on the lake, however, all the specimens 
are of the bright red form. JD. rubra occupies the northern 
Pacific Coast region and extends as far as Mount Hood, Oregon. 
It may prove that the three forms are but "geographical races of 
one species, though they certainly appear distinct, and must be 
kept separate for the present at least. The larvae of kasloa were 
obtained by me at Kaslo, B. C. ; those of rubra were bred from 
eggs kindly sent by Rev. G. W. Taylor from Wellington, B. C. 
They are alike. .Stretch's description of the c? vagans larva 
differs in being darker, the dorsal warts and hairs blackish instead 
of brown ; his 9 larva appears to correspond with the larvae 
before us. I failed to observe this curious sexual difference in 
color in the larvae of rubra. Possibly my larvae are all females. 
I had forgotten Stretch's observation, so that I did not direct my 



OF WASHINGTON. 19 

attention to the point until now, when I have only the inflated 
larvae. But a portion of the larvae of kasloa are blackish instead 
of brown, and these are doubtless the males. 

A considerable number of synonymic and varietal names of 
rubra and vagans exrst, but, after carefully re-reading the de 
scriptions, I do not think that any of them refer to kasloa. But 
ler's ivalsinghami comes the nearest. It was described from the 
Rogue River, Oregon, from one female specimen. A second 
specimen from the same place is referred by Sir G. F. Hampson 
apparently as normal rubra, so that it seems certain that ival 
singhami is only an unusually red 9 of that species. 



Dr. Dyar presented also the following notes :

Since commenting before the Society upon the species of Epi- 
pyrops found in Japan by Mr. Y. Nawa * I have received two 
specimens of the moth from that gentleman. The specimens, 
females, agree with the figures published in " The Insect World." 
The venation is correctly shown, except that the bar between 
veins 7 and 8 of hind wings should be continuous. The species 
may appropriately be named Epipyrops naiuai, after its dis 
coverer. The entire insect is black, the fore wings with many 
irregular lines of raised bluish metallic scales. Expanse, 22 mm.

HALESIDOTA MACULATA HARRIS, AND ITS VARIETIES. 

By HARRISON G. DYAR. 

The past season's collecting has brought to light some new 
facts concerning this species. It has been shown that the larva 
of the form alni, described from the Sierra Nevada of California, 
has red dorsal tufts on a yellow ground when young, replaced 
by a uniformly brownish yellow coat when mature, disregarding 
the black ends, which are the same in all the forms. This form 
occurs in the Kootenay District of British Columbia. I had 
supposed that the form would be found throughout the North 
west, and, indeed, Sir G. F. Hampson has adopted this con 
clusion by making angulifera Walk., described from Vancouver 

* Proc. Ent. Soc. Wash., v, p. 180, 1903, and Insect World, vn, pi. i, 1903. 



20 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

Island, synonymous with alni. However, this is not the case. 
Larvae from Victoria, Shawnigan Lake and Wellington, B. C., 
have black dorsal tufts on a yellow field when young, and these 
tufts persist in the mature larva, but in a brownish yellow field, 
thus showing a form of larva distinct from any previously known 
in North America. Walker's name angulifera may be used 
for it. The form occurs also on the mainland, at Vancouver, 
B. C., according to information furnished by Mr. R. V. Harvey. 
Mr. H. S. Barber has collected quite a series of H. maculata 
at Eureka, California. Without the larva I am unable to say 
whether they should be referred to alni or angulifera. But 
aside from this matter there is represented among them a very 
curious variety, which I describe as follows : 

Halesidota maculata, variety eureka, n. var. 

Entirely suffused with brown, all the marks obliterate. Thorax brown, 
showing a faint lighter shade on vertex of head, patagia and disk. Fore 
wing brown along costa, inner magin, discal dot and a broad shade be 
yond it, the rest of the wing lighter yellow brown ; hind wing whitish 
yellow. Except for the brown tone, it strongly suggests H. bicolor 
Walker {pura Neumoegen).

Specimens of moths and larvae were exhibited. 

Dr. Dyar showed, also, microscopic slides of the larval and 
pupal skins of the mosquitoes Megarhinus rutilus Coquillett 
and M. portoricensis Roeder, and commented upon the structure 
and systematic position of the larvae. The slides were prepared 
by Mr. F. C. Pratt, who had bred the species at Woodstock, 
Virginia, the past summer. All the males reared belonged to 
rutilus while the females were portoricensis. Dr. Dyar said 
that he had examined Mr. Pratt's slides with some care and 
could not detect the slightest difference between the skins of M. 
portoricensis and M. rutilus. He presented the following de 
scription of the larvae :

the tip, the bunch folding outward in retraction. The mandibles 
bear five large teeth, of which the first, second and fourth are 
larger than the third and fifth ; there are a set of fine brushes 
just within the labrum and on the maxillae. The antennae are 
slender, straight, not very long, uniformly colored brown like 
the head. The body hairs all arise from large, chitinous plates. 
Those of the thorax are short, thick and finely branched ; of the 
abdomen longer, with more delicate branches. The chitinized 
part of the air-tube is short, conic, not much longer than wide, 
out there is a basal unchitinized portion that does not show on 
the slides. The tube is without pecten, but bears two small tufts. 
On the sides of the eighth segment are a pair of large, ragged- 
edged plates, replacing the comb. The anal segment is ringed, 
short, the ventral brush confined to the barred area, the wide 
bars containing eyelet holes from which the tufts arise. The 
dorsal tuft is small and arises from the upper edge of a rounded, 
nearly black plate. The posterior rim of the segment is fringed 
with long spines. The larva falls in the synoptic table with 
Psorophora, differing from that in the presence of a plate on 
the side of the eighth segment instead of a comb of spines. 



Mr. Schwarz exhibited a specimen of the Dendrobium 
longicorn beetle (Diaxenes dendrobii Gahan). This genus of 
Cerambycidae is known to infest, in the larval state, the stems of 
various orchid plants which are native to the Philippine Islands 
and to British Burmah. Plants infested with these beetles have 
of late years been frequently imported into the orchid houses of 
Paris and London, and quite a literature has arisen, in the 
French and English entomological and horticultural journals, on 
the ravages committed by this beetle upon these costly plants. 
Mr. Schwarz said that the specimen exhibited was the first one 
ever recorded from the United States. The plant in question is 
an East Indian species and was imported by Mr. George Field, 
a florist of Washington, D. C., by way of London, England. 
Since there has been only one specimen of the beetle found, 
there seems to be no danger at present that the species is getting 
acclimatized in the orchid houses of this country. 

In connection with some remarks made by Mr. Doolittle on 
the food habits of longicorn beetles, Mr. Schwarz stated that 
the imagoes of a conspicuous species common in Texas, Arizona 



22 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

and Mexico {Dendrobias quadrimaculatus Dupont), is espe 
cially fond of printers' ink and sometimes obliterates the large 
letters on the posters of theatrical performances, etc., which are 
pasted on walls and fences. 

Mr. Schwarz then exhibited male and female specimens of 
a remarkable Meloid beetle {Leonina neomexicana Cockerell), 
which were found at Denver, Colorado, by Mr. S. Arthur 
Johnson in the cells of bees of the genus Anthophora. These 
specimens, having been kept in alcohol, are the only well-pre 
served examples knownto him ; the type specimen in the Dr. 
Horn collection in Philadelphia is dried and pinned, and does not 
show any trace of the natural beauty of these insects. At the 
same time Mr. Schwarz showed specimens of the other parasitic 
Meloid beetle, Hornia minutipennis Riley, found by Mr. 
Johnson at the same place and under the same conditions as I^e- 
onina. According to Mr. Schwarz's experience, Hornia minu- 
tipennis is very widely distributed in the United States. Besides 
the type specimen from St. Louis, Missouri, there are specimens 
in the National Museum collection from Washington, D. C., 
Helena, Montana, and Alameda, California. 

Mr. Heidemann exhibited specimens of Aulacostethus 
marmoratus Say, a species belonging to the hemipterous family 
Scutelleridae. They were collected recently at Plu miner's Is 
land, Maryland, by Mr. August Busck. This is the first record 
of this species from the vicinity of Washington, most of the 
specimens in collections coming from the pine regions of New 
Jersey. A few weeks after Mr. Busck secured his specimens, 
Mr. Heidemann visited Plummer's Island himself and captured 
further examples of the species from juniper by beating. He 
showed, also, for comparison, specimens of Aulacostethus 
simulant Uhler, the only other known species of the genus, 
taken by Mr. E. A. Schwarz at Key West, Florida. Neither of 
the species is common in insect cabinets. 

A discussion ensued in regard to the fauna of Plummer's 
Island, Maryland. This small island lies in the Potomac river, 
some ten miles above Washington, D. C., and on it the Washing 
ton Biologists' Field Club has erected a small house. Mr. Schwarz 
stated that the entomological members of the club had, during the 



OF WASHINGTON. 23 

past two years, made an attempt to systematically investigate the 
fauna of the island. Lack of time had prevented a thorough investi 
gation of the fauna during day time, but a rather thorough collec 
tion had been made of insects attracted to light, and some 2,000 
or 3,000 species of insects of all orders would be listed from that 
particular spot at some future date. The fauna of the island 
shows a great difference from that found within the limits of the 
District of Columbia proper. Such species as the beetles Calo- 
soma and Hydrophilus, the water bug Benacus, the large may 
flies which swarm around the electric lights, and numerous other 
insects which are common in Washington, do not seem to occur 
at Plummer's Island. Mr. Schwarz referred, also, to the re 
markable difference in fauna between the southern, dry slope of 
the island and the northern, more shady and more humid side. 
The fauna of the Virginia shore opposite the island is similar 
to that of the northern portion of the island. Mr. Morris and 
Mr. Waite said that Mr. Schwarz's views as to the difference in 
fauna in that region are borne out by a study of the -flora. Mr. 
Schwarz remarked, also, on the difference in time of appearance 
of a number of species at Plummer's Island from that on the 
lower Potomac in the vicinity of Washington. This was especi 
ally exemplified in the case of the may-beetles {Lachnosterna), 
concerning which careful records had been published by Dr. 
John B. Smith in his well known papers on the Lachnosterna 
fauna of Washington, D. C. The insects at Plummer's Island 
seem to come out one or two weeks later in the season than at 
Washington. 

Mr. Banks reported that he had taken the Chrysopid Mele- 
oma signoretti Fitch at Plummer's Island the past season. This 
was the first record for the species so far south. It was origi 
nally described from the Green Mountains of Vermont and had, 
since then, been recorded from Mt. Washington and Frariconia, 
New Hampshire, and Sea Cliff, New York.

Mr. Currie presented the following paper : 

AN INSECT-COLLECTING TRIP TO BRITISH COLUMBIA. 
By ROI.LA P. CURRIE. 

During the past summer I was enabled, through the kindness 
of Dr. H. G. Dyar, leave of absence having been granted me by 
the U. S. National Museum, to spend about ten weeks, in com 
pany with Dr. Dyar and Mr. A. N. Caudell, in an investigation 
of the insect fauna of the Kootenay District of British Columbia. 
Our headquarters during this time was the town of Kaslo, situ 
ated towards the northern end and on the western shore of 
Kootenay Lake. Dr. Dyar was the first to arrive on the ground, 
reaching Kaslo on the z8th of May, while the writer arrived on 
the 8th of June, and Mr. Caudell on the i5th. 

Although occupied principally with collecting and rearing 
Lepidoptera and mosquitoes, Dr. Dyar nevertheless found time 
to secure many other insects of various orders. Mr. Caudell did 
a good share of the collecting although the work of inflating 
lepidopterous larvae, which fell to his lot, frequently monopolized 
his time. The writer, therefore, was the only member of the 
party who was able to devote himself exclusively to general col 
lecting. 

We are much indebted to Mr. J. Win. Cockle, part proprietor 
of the Kaslo Hotel and a pioneer in British Columbia, for what 
success we achieved on the trip. Mr. Cockle is an enthusiastic 
student and collector of Lepidoptera, and possesses a large and 
handsome collection of the species occurring in eastern British 
Columbia. He often accompanied us on our trips and planned 
several special excursions to interesting localities for our benefit. 
His thorough knowledge of the region was of great help to us 
and his interest in our expedition, as manifested not only by do 
nations of specimens but in many other ways, added much to the 
pleasure of our stay. 

I desire to express our thanks to Mr. W. R. Allen, Secretary 
of the Kaslo & Slocan Railway, for many kindnesses. Mr. 
Allen at one time made a collection of British Columbia Lepi 
doptera and presented it to the University of Oxford. Although 
not actively engaged in collecting at the time of our visit, he 
nevertheless secured a number of specimens for us, and we cap 
tured many good moths in front of the photographic laboratory 
in his garden, at the electric light which he obligingly left burn 
ing for us. He accompanied us on one of our trips and has had 
printed for us a fine set of his photographs of local scenery. He

also arranged a hand-car trip from Payne Mine to Kaslo for our 
benefit. 

Among the many other persons who helped us by bringing in 
specimens which came to their notice I would mention in partic 
ular Master Stephenson, younger son of the Kaslo druggist, who 
developed into an enthusiastic collector and devoted considerable 
time to getting insects for us. 

As a result of the summer's work between 38,000 and 39,000 
insects, spiders and myriapods were brought back. It seems de 
sirable, therefore, as a preface to Dr. Dyar's paper on British 
Columbia mosquitoes and to other papers which, it is hoped, 
will appear from time to time upon different groups of insects 
contained in the collection, to give this brief account of the trip, 
together with short descriptions of the localities visited. Prof. 
C. V. Piper, former Entomologist of the Washington Agricul 
tural College Experiment Station, has kindly furnished me with 
the scientific names of the trees, shrubs, and other plants men 
tioned in this article. 

Kootenay Lake is located in the Selkirk Mountains in eastern 
British Columbia and is some eighty miles long by from one to 
five miles wide. Its water is very cold and up to a short dis 
tance from the shore is said to have a uniform depth of 400 feet. 
The water this year (1903) reached a height of twenty-four feet 
above low-water mark in the early summer and was still some 
what higher than normal when I left. The mountains rise di 
rectly from the shores of the lake to an altitude of 10,000 feet or 
less. Their summits are usually bare and rocky and, in many 
cases, have snow on their slopes throughout the summer. The 
climate is less severe in winter than in the Rocky Mountains, 
although colder than on the Pacific Coast. Although there is 
much snow during the late fall, winter and early spring months, 
the large lakes do not freeze over, but are open for navigation the 
entire year. Usually the rainfall is light in summer and there 
are many forest fires ; but last summer it rained so frequently as 
to interfere considerably with our collecting. 

The forests in this region are notable on account of the large 
size and luxuriant growth of the trees smaller than those of the 
Pacific Coast, but considerably larger than those in the Rocky 
Mountains. Giant cedar ( Thuya plicata) and hemlock ( Tsuga 
heterophylla} seem to predominate in the lower altitudes, al 
though interspersed with Western larch (Larix occidentalis], 
yellow pine (Pinus ponderosa} and Douglas and Engelmann 
spruces (Pseudotsuga mucronata and Picea englemanni}. 
Higher up subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa} and spruce are the 
prevailing trees. In the clearings and along the creeks are balm

bleberry (Rubtts nutkanus), raspberry (Rubus strzgosus}, 
gooseberry (Ribcs irriguum}, service-berry \Amelanchier 
Jloridd) and huckleberry ( Vaccinitim membranaceum} are com 
mon shrubs, while among the most abundant flowering plants 
are Epilobium spicatum, Spircea corymbosa, a species of 
Hieraceum and Anaphalis margaritacea. Between the upper 
portion of the thickly timbered area and the rocky peaks of the 
mountain summits there is usually a considerable area with scant 
and stunted trees, or no trees at all, the ground covered with 
sedge, heather (Phyllodoce empetriformis and Cassiope mer- 
tensiana) and a variety of boreal or subarctic flowering plants. 

Following is a list of the localities where collections were 
made. Whenever possible the exact or approximate altitude is 
given. 

Kaslo (altitude 1,670 feet), May 29 to August 20. As 
stated above, this town, located on Kootenay Lake, was our 
headquarters, and the great majority of our specimens were ob 
tained within easy walking or rowing distance of there. The 
town is built upon the south side of a small bay and is bounded 
on the south by Kaslo Creek at the time of our arrival a large 
and powerful mountain torrent though diminishing greatly in 
volume later in the season. At no place did collecting give bet 
ter results than here. The creek harbored a variety of neurop- 
teroid and other aquatic Iarva3, while the deciduous trees which 
lined its banks were the resting places of many stoneflies, cad- 
disflies and the like. From the many young trees springing up 
in the clearings back of the town and in those places which had, 
a few years back, been visited by forest fires, a variety of wood- 
inhabiting Coleoptera were beaten, together with parasitic Hy- 
menoptera, Chrysopidas, Hemerobiidae and Raphidiidae, small 
Diptera, Homoptera and Heteroptera, and innumerable spiders. 
The thimbleberry and other bushes made excellent sweeping for 
small Hymenoptera ; the clover patches, on sunny days, were 
alive with various kinds of bees ; and the grass and weeds of 
pastures and vacant lots'yielded an embarrassing number of vari 
ous small Diptera. Butterflies and moths of many kinds were 
abundant, especially in the clearings and more open forest and 
along the roadsides, while many of the night-flying moths 
could be detected and put to flight by thrashing the underbrush, 
shrubs and young trees with a stout stick or pole. Caddisworms, 
mosquito larvag, aquatic Coleoptera and Hemiptera, etc., were

found in abundance in the spring-fed pools and marshy forest 
ponds, and adults of these insects could, of course, be found in 
the neighborhood. 

Although sugaring for moths was tried at other localities, 
Kaslo was the only place where our efforts met with marked 
success. We began sugaring about the middle of June and in 
that month sugared three times, according to my record. Dur 
ing the first half of July we went out about three times a week 
and during the remainder of July and in August sugared almost 
every evening when not prevented by rain. During the early 
part of summer, moths were not particularly abundant at sugar, 
and 100 or 200 specimens an evening was considered a fair 
catch. But later in the season the number of moths steadily in 
creased and during August, up to the time we left, 1,000 or 2,000 
specimens could easily be taken almost every evening. On one 
occasion we even exceeded that number and secured 2,330. 
Species as well as numbers of individuals were well represented, 
75 species a night being the usual average in the latter part of 
the collecting. Although there were naturally long series of 
some species, vet of not many did we secure a larger number of 
specimens than we had use for. 

Our method of procedure, though probably not essentially 
different from that of others who sugar for moths, was as follows : 
About 7 o'clock or 7.30 in the evening we went over the route 
and put on the " sugar," which, according to Mr. Cockle's for 
mula, was made by heating a mixture of three pounds of sugar 
and one pound of molasses until thoroughly dissolved, then 
thinning with beer until of a syrupy consistence and adding a 
small glass of rum. This was spread, by means of a good-sized 
whitewash brush, upon stumps, fence boards and palings, tele 
graph poles, etc., along certain roads and paths back of Kaslo, 
usually along a circuitous route which brought us back to the 
starting point without going twice over the same ground. About 
9.30 we started out again, equipped with a lantern, several large 
and small cyanide jars of good strength, a few vials of alcohol 
and two large muslin sacks one of which contained i ^o or 200 
empty paper pill boxes. The moths were caught on the sugar 
by clapping the cyanide jar over them and, when partially over 
come by the fumes, they were removed to pill boxes, each moth 
being put, when possible, in a separate box.* Each pill box, as 
it was filled, was then transferred to the empty muslin sack. 
Next morning the boxes were opened, male moths removed to 
cyanide bottles and the females confined in glass jars in order, if 
possible, to secure eggs from them for life history studies. 

* The Microlepidoptera were not kept alive, but were collected directly 
into chloroform killing vials and left there till our return to the hotel. 



28 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

After the first of August we discarded the pill boxes, as it was 
deemed now too late in the season to start new life-history cul 
tures, and Dr. Dyar was sufficiently occupied with caring for those 
already obtained. It was noticed that many moths fell from the 
sugar into the grass and onto the ground and were lost while we 
were engaged in collecting the others. Mr. Caudell, however, 
soon contrived a way to prevent this. A semicircle of springy 
wire was sewed to the top of a cloth funnel about one foot in 
diameter the bottom of which, furnished with a strong elastic, 
fitted tightly around the mouth of a large cyanide jar of extra 
strength. On approaching a sugared tree, pole or stump the un- 
wired side of the funnel was made to fit closely around it just be 
low the lower moths. A little jarring and blowing, or a light 
brushing with the fingers would precipitate them all into the fun 
nel and down into the cyanide jar below. The jar was then 
corked, and as soon as the moths became quiet they were trans 
ferred to a storage cyanide jar and packed lightly between layers 
of cotton. A canvas apron with a number of pockets, devised 
by Mr. Caudell, served admirably the purpose of carrying a con 
venient number of cyanide jars so as to be immediately available. 
On the warmer evenings when there was considerable moisture 
in the air there seemed to be a greater flight of moths than when 
it was cold and dry ; and in moist weather we noticed that it was 
unnecessary to put on fresh sugar every evening, for just as many, 
or even more, moths were captured when the sugar was a day, 
or even two days, old. 

Moths were by no means the only insects attracted to the sugar. 
Aspec\esoiCeutop/u7us was frequently taken, and daddy-long-legs 
(Phalangidea) were attracted in some numbers. One species 
of Chrysopa was often taken at the sugar, as also a few small 
caddisflies and some specimens of a longicorn beetle, Pachyta 
spurca LeConte. Some of our sugared stumps became so thickly 
infested with ants that other insects would not alight on them. 
We noticed, also, in several places where a stump was sugared 
but a few inches above the ground, that a large toad or a tree 
frog was nearly always stationed at its base to capture the moths 
which alighted within its reach. One especial stump seemed to 
be a favorite, for as many as four toads were sometimes noticed 
beside it. 

As the nights were nearly always cool there was never any such 
flight of moths to light as we are accustomed to in more southern 
localities around Washington, D. C., for instance ; but a small 
number could be secured by going the rounds of the electric 
lights in Kaslo and visiting the electric-light plant at the creek. 
The Bombycoid moths, which are not attracted to sugar, were 
mostly taken at light. Toward the close of the season we rigged 



OF WASHINGTON. 29 

up a large white sheet in what appeared to be a favorable local 
ity and placed a good lantern and reflector behind it ; but this ap 
paratus was so little of a success in attracting moths that we 
abandoned it after a few trials. 

Besides the localities immediately around Kaslo, specimens ob 
tained from several near-by places on or near Kootenay Lake 
bear Kaslo labels. One of these we allude to in our notes as 
" Lily pad Lake" and some of our captures have this additional 
label. It is a small marshy pond, filled with water lillies and 
other aquatic plants, about a mile and a half south of Kaslo on 
the road leading to Mirror Lake. This was a favorite locality 
for collecting mosquitoes and caddisflies, in their different stages, 
and seemed to be the nearest place to Kaslo where dragonflies 
bred in any numbers. The shores of the "lake" were covered 
with a dense growth of trees and shrubs, and about the only way 
to secure dragonflies was by walking out over the water on some 
prostrate log and waiting for them to come within reach, taking 
care to avoid losing one's balance when making a pass at them. 
Mirror Lake, three miles south of Kaslo, is considerably larger 
than Lilypad Lake and less overgrown with aquatic plants. It 
is joined to Kootenay Lake by a covered ditch and is but a few 
steps distant. In winter enough ice is harvested from it to sup 
ply the country near by. This proved an excellent collecting 
ground for dragonflies, mayflies and caddisflies, and on the moist 
shores Saldid bugs were abundant. Many of the caddisflies were 
discovered by jarring the branches of the trees near the lake, thus 
putting them to flight and making their capture possible. Some 
of the specimens bear Mirror Lake labels in addition to Kaslo 
labels. Fletcher's Ranch, about five miles south of Kaslo and 
at some elevation above the lake, was visited by Dr. Dyar, Mr. 
Cockle and myself on June 1 1 . The place was reached by tak 
ing a rowboat to a point some distance south of Mirror Lake, and 
then following a road up the mountain for a short way. Here 
a mountain meadow and pasture, covered in some places by a 
few inches of water, made a good collecting ground for dragon- 
flies and a variety of other insects. The mouth of Cooper Creek, 
about three miles north of Kaslo on the opposite side of the lake, 
was several times visited. Beating was good here, and on one 
occasion, during June when the water in the creek was high, -I 
collected a number of Carabid beetles, centipedes, spiders, etc., 
in the drift brought down by the creek. Powder Creek, oppo 
site and a little south of Kaslo on the east side of the lake, has, 
near its mouth, a beautiful waterfall some forty feet in height. 
The creek proved a good collecting ground for caddisflies and 
stoneflies, and was the only locality near Kaslo where I found 
ant-lions, several pits being discovered in the sand.

Kaslo Creek, June 18 and jo. On these dates Mr. Caudell 
and I made trips by the Kaslo & Slocan Railway to points re 
spectively sixteen and ten miles west of Kaslo. Specimens col 
lected at these points bear the label "Kaslo Creek" for want of 
a more definite locality. The railroad follows up the creek 
which, in many places, is lined with pools of standing water af 
fording an abundance of Culicid and caddisfly larvae and other 
aquatic insects. On these trips we secured specimens of the 
enormous predaceous Culicid larva Eucorethra zinderivoodi Un 
derwood. At the time we thought they were something new, but 
on returning to Kaslo found that Dr. Dyar had taken smaller 
specimens of the same larva near Kaslo some time before and 
had them in a breeding jar in the hotel. The rank growth of 
grass and weeds made good sweeping, and we obtained a num 
ber of the delicate little mayflies which were hovering in undu 
lating swarms above the railroad track. On June 30, at the ten- 
mile locality, I secured a specimen of the rare and interesting 
aquatic beetle Amphizoa among drift wood in the creek. On 
returning from one of these trips we discovered that holding a 
net out of the window of the moving train was an easy and pro 
fitable method of sweeping. 

Lardo {altitude i,6jO feet}, July 7- This town is situated 
at the north end of Kootenay Lake about twenty miles from 
Kaslo. Dr. Dyar visited the place on the afternoon of July 7 
and secured a few insects. 

Antoine Mine, McGuigan {altitude about 10,000 feet}. 
This mine 1 is located in what is known as the McGuigan Basin, 
in the mountains south of McGuigan a station on the Kaslo & 
Slocan Railway about twenty-five miles west of Kaslo. Mr. 
Cockle had planned an excursion to this locality for August, but 
rainy weather necessitated giving it up. Nevertheless, Mr. An 
derson of the Antoine Mine, who had kindly invited us to come 
there, collected a few specimens for us. 

Frye Creek {altitude 1 ,6jO feet}, July 23 . The mouth of 
this creek, about nine miles north of Kaslo on the east side of 
the lake, is a favorite camping and picnic ground, and we took 
advantage of a Sunday-school excursion to visit the place. There 
is quite a stretch of sandy beach here and huckleberries are plen- 
ti-ful hence its popularity. The scenery in Frye Creek canyon 
is very wild and beautiful. An excellent trail has been con 
structed through it' for several miles giving a good opportunity of 
viewing its beauties and collecting insects. The collecting at 
this place pleased Mr. Caudell so well that he wandered far up 
the canyon, and when the excursion steamboat was ready to re 
turn to Kaslo he was nowhere to be found. After a half hour's 
waiting we were rewarded by seeing him saunter up serene and

smiling, in entire ignorance of the anxiety of his friends and the 
impatience to get home of those who knew not the fascinations of 
" bug hunting." 

Ainsworth, July 10 and n. This is a small mining town on 
the western shore of Kootenay Lake about twelve miles south of 
Kaslo. In the mountains back of the town which rise abruptly 
from the lake about three miles distant by wagon road and at 
an elevation of about 5.000 feet, is an interesting limestone cave, 
known as Cody's Cave. As this cave is located in a good col 
lecting region Mr. Cockle planned a trip there, and on the morn 
ing of July 10 Dr. Dyar, Mr. Caudell, Messrs. Kane and Lucas 
of Kaslo, and myself accompanied him by steamer to Ainsworth. 
Here the Presbyterian minister, Mr. G. H. Findley, who was 
much interested in the cave and thoroughly familiar with it, vol 
unteered to act as our guide. We found collecting good all 
along the road on the way up and secured quite a number of 
specimens at altitudes between 2,500 and 5,000 feet. About 
eleven o'clock we stopped by the side of a small creek for lunch. 
While here we made a short search for aquatic insects and on 
turning over small stones in the water found a number of may 
fly and stonefly nymphs and cadclisfly larvae and a few specimens 
of the peculiar dipterous larvae of the family Blepharoceridae. 
After lunch we left the road, and a steep climb of a half mile 
over rocks and fallen timber brought us to the mouth of the cave. 

The cave is of considerable size and some time was spent in 
exploring it. A small, shallow stream of icy cold water flows 
through it, in some places almost covering the floor. The sta 
lagmites and stalactites were, in most places, small and few in 
number, indicating, it would seem, that the cave is of compara 
tively recent origin. In some places the walls of the cave were 
of considerable height, but in others we were obliged to crawl 
prostrate in order to get through. Mr. Kane took several flash 
light photographs which give an excellent idea of its appearance. 
The cave seemed to contain no animal life of any kind. This 
was a disappointment to us, for had it been inhabited by bats or 
other animals the presence of insects might have been confidently 
looked for. It was so cold and wet, however, as to be manifesly 
unfitted for animal life. I examined the limestone mud, delved 
into out-of-the-way corners and overturned stones in the stream, 
but found no trace of insects. 

After leaving the cave the party, with the exception of Mr. 
Caudell and myself, returned to Ainsworth and Kaslo, while we 
went back to the road and followed it a mile and a half further 
to the No. T Mine. Here we were most hospitably entertained 
by the mine superintendent and his two assistants. The next 
morning we started down the road towards Ainsworth, collect- 



32 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

ing as we went. We lunched at the same place as the day be 
fore and spent some time sweeping the banks of the creek for 
neuropteroid insects, hymenopterous parasites, etc., and exam 
ined the bed of the stream for aquatic larvae. Here Mr. Caudell 
secured a specimen of the water beetle .Amphizoa and some 
more Blepharocerid larvae similar to those I found the day before. 
About a mile above Ainsvvorth and near the road is a long pond 
of several acres area called Loon Lake. Here were captured a 
number of dragonflies, representing several species. We reached 
Ainsworth late in the afternoon and returned to Kaslo in the 
evening. 

Bear Lake {altitude J ,800 feet) , July 20 and 29. A sta 
tion on the Kaslo & Slocan Railway twenty miles west of Kaslo. 
Here are two small mountain lakes from the smallest of which, 
Fish Lake, Kaslo Creek takes its origin. The other lake, known 
as Bear Lake, is just west of Fish Lake. Mr. Caudell and I 
visited this locality on July 20 in company with Mr. Cockle, and 
spent the afternoon collecting near the two lakes and along the 
railroad track. Butterflies and bees were found around the 
flowering plants, and the grass, weeds, small trees and bushes 
yielded a large number and variety of insects from sweeping. 
Neuropteroid insects were particularly abundant, especially cad- 
disflies, mayflies and Chrysopidse, and this was the only locality 
where we caught Sialis. We spent the night here and next 
morning climbed the mountain north of Bear Lake by switch 
back trail to London Hill Mine at the summit. On a subsequent 
trip (July 29), Mr. Caudell and I sugared for moths along the 
railroad between Fish and Bear Lakes and secured about 100 
specimens. Two-thirds of these belonged to a single species 
{Noctua sierrce Harvey), not uncommon at Kaslo. Hardly any 
of these moths were peculiar to the locality, but were the same 
species we had collected at Kaslo earlier in the season. 

London Hill Mine, Bear Lake {altitude 7,000 feet}, July 
21, 28 and 20. As stated in the last paragraph, Mr. Cockle, 
Mr. Caudell and I climbed the mountain north of Bear Lake on 
the morning of July 21 and, as the day was warm and sunny, 
spent a few hours collecting at the summit near the abandoned 
London Hill Mine. The forests on the mountains about Bear 
Lake have been completely destroyed by fires and only the 
charred and dead tree trunks remain standing. There was little 
collecting, therefore, on the way up. Around the summit the 
trees are stunted, grow in isolated and straggling patches, and 
have not been reached by the fire. These afforded very fair beat 
ing and sweeping, and the many blossoms covering the treeless 
areas attracted a variety of bees, flies and alpine Lepidoptera. 
On the extreme summit a swarm of Bombyliid, Tachinid and 



OF WASHINGTON. 33 

Syrphid flies was hovering, and a number of them were secured. 
On the patches of still unmelted snow were a large number of 
miscellaneous insects, most of them crawling actively about 
though many others were dead or benumbed with cold. Among 
these snow insects Coleoptera and parasitic Hymenoptera seemed 
most abundant, although the orders Hemiptera, Orthoptera and 
Diptera were also represented. In the afternoon we returned to 
Bear Lake and took the train for Kaslo. 

On July 28, Mr. Caudell and I revisited London Hill Mine in 
company with Dr. Dyar, this time climbing the mountain on 
horseback so as to have more energy for collecting when we 
reached the summit. Threatening showers made collecting 
rather poor and few Lepidoptera were flying, though we secured 
a Parnassius and a few moths. From the snow patches, which 
had shrunken considerably since our former visit, we collected a 
number of insects the majority of which, however, were evidently 
the same species we secured there before. At the Silver Glance 
Mine, a short distance below the summit, we spent the night and 
experienced the customary hearty western hospitality. We tried 
sugaring that evening, along the trail leading up from the camp, 
but with no success whatever. The only creatures found at the 
sugar were a crane fly, a slug and a mouse. Two moths, how 
ever, flew to the lantern just as I was entering the cabin, a Geo- 
metrid and a specimen of the common Noctuid Feltia Vancou 
ver ensis Grote. 

In the morning we went again to the summit, but as the sky 
was overcast butterfly collecting was poor, and about noon Dr. 
Dyar went down to Bear Lake and returned to Kaslo. I spent 
the forenoon in beating the firs and pines and took quite a 
number of small Diptera and parasitic Hymenoptera, some small 
stoneflies, a Coniopterygicl, two Scolytid beetles, a few longi- 
corns, etc. We again examined the snow patches and found a 
good variety of insects, among them a caddisfly and a small 
Hemerobiid. Early in the afternoon the sun came out and we 
were rewarded by securing a number of Lepidoptera and many 
flies and bees from the flower-covered slopes. We walked down 
to Bear Lake in the afternoon, sugared there in the evening and 
returned to Kaslo next day. 

South Fork, August 9. About five miles from Kaslo, on the 
Kaslo & Slocan Railway, at the point where the two branches 
of Kaslo Creek come together, is a station known as South Fork. 
The branch which has its source in Fish Lake and which is fol 
lowed by the railroad is called Kaslo Creek, while the other, 
coming from the south, is known as South Fork. On our way to 
the Kitchener Glacier, August 9, we left the railroad at South 
Fork station and took" saddle horses and pack outfit for the re- 



34 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

mainder of the journey. While waiting here for the horses to be 
saddled and packs adjusted a few miscellaneous insects were 
picked up. 

South Fork Creek, August 9 and u. Along this creek 
there is a good wagon road with trails branching off here and 
there to a number of mines. Dr. Dyar, Mr. Cockle, Mr. Cau- 
dell, Mr. Allen, our guide Joe and myself left South Fork sta 
tion during the forenoon of August 9 on our way to the Kitch 
ener Glacier. Specimens picked up along this road, going to 
and returning from the glacier, bear the label "South Fork 
Creek." The road leads through a forest of large cedars and 
hemlocks, replaced, as higher altitudes are reached, by spruces 
and firs. A water-covered meadow near the creek, visited 
on the return trip (August n), proved to be an excellent place 
for collecting mosquitoes and a large number of mayfly nymphs 
were dredged from the water. 

Kokanee Mountain (altitude, at foot of Kitchener Glacier, 
7,500 to 8,OOO feet), August 10 and n . After following the 
South Fork Creek wagon road for a distance of about seventeen 
miles from South Fork we turned off to the left and climbed Ko 
kanee Mountain by a switchback trail. Below the peaks of the 
mountain is a good sized glacier, known as Kitchener Glacier, 
from which several creeks take their rise, South Fork Creek 
among them. Below the glacier and at the head of South Fork 
Creek are two small lakes, one just above the other. At each 
lake is a mining camp, neither of which were occupied by human 
beings at the time of our visit, although a porcupine had posses 
sion of the camp by the lower lake. We went on to Mansfield 
Camp, on the upper lake, and made this our stopping place. 
The cabin stands close beside the lake, and straight across, over 
hanging the opposite bank, was a wall of glacial ice. 

Next morning, August 10, the day was mostly clear and pleas 
ant and we arose early. After donning smoked glasses and 
waterproof footwear we went on up the mountain and out upon 
the glacier. On the snow, which largely covered the glacier, 
were quite a number and variety of insects, many of them dead 
but a good number alive and uninjured. Mr. Allen took several 
photographs and Mr. Caudell and I, after exploring the lower 
end of that part of the glacier which gives rise to Coffee Creek, 
climbed to the summit of the highest peak of the mountain said 
to be the tallest peak in this entire region. It took us about an 
hour and a half to make the ascent over the snow-covered ice, 
and we had to use care to avoid the crevasses. 

The extreme peak projects above the snow and ice and is a 
mere mass of large loose rocks, having only a few yards area on 
top. The view was magnificent. Upon the opposite side to 



OF WASHINGTON. 35 

that by which we made the ascent is an almost precipitous fall of 
several hundred feet, and far below could be seen small lakes and 
winding creeks while on all sides the eye overlooked the tops of 
a wilderness of mountain peaks. The only insects seen here were 
a few Diptera. We remained awhile to rest and, if possible, to 
fix in our mind's eye the awe-inspiring picture before us, then re 
turned to camp, collecting on the way. Mr. Caudell secured one 
specimen of the grasshopper Podisma polita Scudder, a species 
recorded only from Oregon in Scudder's Catalogue of Orthop- 
tera. The others were back from another part of the mountain 
and reported that collecting was somewhat disappointing and 
butterflies not as abundant as was expected. 

After supper we sugared along the trail from our camp to the 
camp on the lower lake. About dusk we noticed a few moths 
flying but on going the rounds later we had almost as little suc 
cess as on Bear Lake Mountain, the only insects found on the 
sugar being a few craneflies and one or two caddisflies no moths 
whatever. From these two experiences in sugaring at high alti 
tudes we reached the conclusion that in such localities, where 
the nights are naturally cold, moths cannot be captured by this 
method of collecting. On our way back to camp Mr. Caudell shot 
a porcupine. Next morning as it was cloudy and threatened rain 
we concluded not to remain another day, so packed up our outfit 
and returned to Kaslo. On the way down the mountain Mr. 
Allen secured a photograph of the beautiful cascades by which 
South Fork Creek descends to the valley. 

Sandon (altitude 3,800 feet}, August ij. This mining 
town, about thirty miles from Kaslo, is the western terminus of 
the Kaslo & Slocan Railway. I left Kaslo on the morning of 
August 13 on my way home, taking the train to Sandon where I 
spent the afternoon and night, leaving the next morning for 
Nakusp. During the afternoon I collected some bees and other 
Hymenoptera and visited the Slocan Star Mine, said to be one 
of the best dividend-paying silver mines in this region. Mr. 
Oscar White, brother of the mine superintendent, showed me 
through a good part of it, and explained everything to me most 
interestingly. In the evening I made the rounds of the electric 
lights and secured about 90 moths, representing a good variety 
of species. Mr. Geo. C. Robbins, an employee of the Payne 
Mine, went around with me, provided me with extra cyanide jars 
and helped me in catching the specimens. Since my return to 
Washington he has sent us some additional specimens. 

Revelstoke (altitude 1,475 feet}, August 14. As stated 
above, I left Sandon on the morning of the I4th for Nakusp on 
the Upper Arrow Lake, where I took steamer northward to Ar 
rowhead and train thence to Revelstoke. At Wigwam, half 



36 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

way between Arrowhead and Revelstoke, I captured a few mos 
quitoes which entered the car. A few moths and other insects 
were taken that evening at the electric lights on the balcony of 
the C. P. R. Hotel at Revelstoke. 

The following morning (August 15) I took the transcontinental 
eastbound Canadian Pacific train, and thus ended my own col 
lecting so far as British Columbia was concerned. Sunday was 
spent at Banff, in Alberta, the main station of the beautiful 
Rocky Mountain Park of Canada, and here I picked up a few 
insects while out walking. The scenery around Banff reminded 
me of parts of the Yellowstone Park. Here I met Mr. N. B. 
Sanson, who is Curator of the Park Museum, and had a most 
pleasant visit with him. 

Dr. Dyar and Mr. Caudell left Kaslo on August 20. They 
took the lake steamer to Nelson at the foot of the lake ; Mr. Cau 
dell going east from that point and leaving British Columbia by 
the Crow's Nest Pass branch of the Canadian Pacific Railway 
and securing a few specimens at Nelson and Kootenay Landing. 

Dr. Dyar has given me the following account of the remainder 
of his trip. He went from Nelson to Revelstoke by the Arrow 
Lakes steamer, collecting a few specimens at Nelson, West Rob- 
son, Nakusp and Revelstoke. Thence he went west on the 
main line of the C. P. R., reaching Vancouver August 23. He 
left the next day and crossed the water to Victoria on Vancouver 
Island. Five days were spent here doing a little collecting and 
visiting several resident entomologists. Mr. A. W. Hanham, 
Mr. E. M. Anderson and Mr. E. Baynes Reed were met and 
several pleasant hours spent with them. From Victoria, on the 
way to Wellington, Dr. Dyar visited Shawnigan Lake, a station 
on the Esquimault & Nanaimo Railway. At Wellington, at the 
end of the railroad, he was entertained by Rev. G. W. Taylor, 
whose studies of North American Geometridae are just taking 
definite shape. Mr. Theo. Bryant was also met here. Dr. Dyar 
returned to Victoria on September 5, and went back to the main 
land the same night. At Vancouver he visited Mr. R. V. Har 
vey and Mr. A. H. Bush, resident collectors. The same day he 
started for home by the main line of the C. P. R. On Septem 
ber 7 a stop was made at Glacier in the Selkirk Range, and on 
September 8 another at Field. A number of moths were picked 
up at both places although the weather was stormy and cold. On 
September 10 and n a short stop was made at Banff, Alberta, 
but it was snowing heavily over all the mountain peaks and rain 
ing in the town, so practically no insect life was seen. 

The material collected on the trip is now in the U. S. National 
Museum, together with about 500 specimens of Lepidoptera 
which were given Dr. Dyar for the National Museum by the en-

gave valuable material, not sparing species that were uniques in 
his collection.

Dr. Dyar then read the following paper : 

NOTES ON THE MOSQUITOES OF BRITISH COLUMBIA. 
By HARRISON G. DYAR. 

In conjunction with some other work, I made observations on 
the mosquitoes of British Columbia, Canada, particularly in th.e 
Kootenay District, during the past season. This was done in 
connection with the mosquito work which is being promoted by 
Dr. Howard, with the help of the Carnegie Institution. 

British Columbia is a mountainous region in general, with a 
fairly abundant rainfall. Nevertheless, towards the middle of 
summer it becomes generally dry and most natural breeding 
places for mosquitoes disappear. The mosquitoes, therefore, 
come early and are soon gone, and are, in the main, composed 
of those species which develop rapidly and hibernate in the egg 
state. Culex pipiens was not seen anywhere in British Colum 
bia, nor was any species of Anopheles met with except in a 
single instance. The place of C. pipiens in rain barrels and 
other stagnant water is taken by C. incidens. 

I will mention the species in the order of their comparative 
abundance. I desire to express my thanks to Mr. Caudell and 
Mr. Currie for the kind assistance which they rendered me. I 
am indebted to Mr. Coquillett for patiently examining my 1,238 
specimens. 

Culex impiger Walker.* 

This was by far the commonest mosquito. Early pools in the 
mountains, rilled by the drainage from the melting snow banks, 
contained the larvae and pupae, apparently by the million. Near 
Kootenay Lake they had all gone in May ; but higher in the hills 
larvae could still be found till the middle of June, and at Kokanee 
Mountain, at the foot of the glacier, I found many larvae on Au 
gust 10. The adults soon became very common in the woods, 
though in a few weeks they were much worn and later disap-

give the differentiation of impiger and reptans in the new edition of Dr. 
Howard's " Mosquitoes."

peared, except in the high damp valleys where they persisted 
longer. Eggs were obtained of the usual spindle shape but 
shorter and thicker than those of C '. cantans. They were laid 
singly and hibernated. The larva closely resembles that of C. 
canadensis, with which it sometimes occurred mixed. It may 
be distinguished by the larger and coarser ventral brush of the 
anal segment, composed of longer stemmed tufts and by most of 
the chitinized parts being black instead of brown. 

Culex cantans Meigen. 

These mosquitoes became common in the woods in July, 
gradually disappearing soon after. Eggs were obtained from 
captured females, laid singly and of the usual elongate fusiform 
shape, but they all hibernated, none having hatched at the time 
of writing. Mr. O. A. Johannsen has described the larva. It 
falls in the synoptic table in the long-tubed group with C. res- 
tuans, quite an unexpected association, since its other charac 
ters are those of the short-tubed larvaB. 

Culex reptans Meigen. 

This species appeared rather late in the season, no examples 
being seen till the end of June, after which it became fairly 
abundant. The flies were persistent in their attacks, alighting 
and biting at once, without the preliminary deliberations seen in 
other species of Culex. This is the summer mosquito of the 
Kootenays and lasted longer than any other of the single-brooded 
species. Eggs were obtained of the usual spindle shape, rather 
thick and unusually small, laid singly. They have hibernated. 
The larva was not seen. 

Culex canadensis Theobald. 

This mosquito was not rare early in the season, but soon dis 
appeared. The larvae bred in the early pools left by the melting 
snows, but apparently made no attempt to continue breeding 
later in the season, as I observed to be the case in New Hamp 
shire. In fact there was no suitable water left for them, and the 
eggs must all hibernate, making the species single brooded. 

Culex incidens Thomson. 

This species was at no time abundant, though occasional speci 
mens were met with all the season from May to September. The 
species breeds continuously, the larvae hatching from floating 
boat-shaped masses of eggs as with C. pipiens. They could be 
found at any time in every old water barrel, pump tub, or dug 
out spring hole. Also in holes formed by overturned tree-stumps 
in swampy land, though nature seemed to furnish surprisingly 
few breeding places for the larvae. If it were worth while, this

species could be easily greatly reduced in numbers by treating the 
artificial breeding places. The larvae closely resemble the mature 
larva which I have figured as C. consobrinus from specimens 
sent me by Messrs. Dupree and Morgan. They are generally 
darker, the chitinized parts being usually black, though some 
occur of a lighter tint, and these I am at present unable to dis 
tinguish from C. consobrinus by any character whatever.* I bred 
adults from larvae found in a fresh-water pool near the sea at 
Victoria and in a rain-water barrel at Wellington, B. C. Also 
from pools impregnated with hydrogen sulphide at Banff, Al 
berta. 

Culex punctor Kirby. 

This was one of the very early species. A single larva and 
several pupae were taken in a pool full of algae behind a stump in 
a boggy part of the woods on May 31. The adults were flying 
at the same time, with the early C. incidens, but they disap 
peared soon. The eggs are spindle shaped, unusually thick and 
short, diamond-shaped and rather large. They were laid singly 
and hibernated. The larva falls in the table with C. sollicitans, 
but is differentiated by having the lateral comb of the 8th segment 
composed of four or five large thorn-shaped teeth instead of a 
small patch. It is very close to Culex serratus as recently de 
scribed by Smith, f 

Culex sylvestris Theobald. 

The adults occurred in July in small numbers, mixed with C. 
cantans. No new facts were learned about the life history. 

Culex varipalpus Coquillett. 

A few adults were taken at altitudes higher than Kootenay 
Lake. They were fairly common on the summit of a mountain 
near Bear Lake at an altitude of 7,000 feet, but only a single 
specimen was taken anywhere else. I owe the discovery of the 
larva to Mr. J. W. Cockle, who was on the lookout for new 
wrigglers for me. Mr. Cockle found some larvae in a pool, 
mainly C. incidens as we learned afterward, and, having no 
bottle with him, entered an abandoned Chinaman's shack for a 
vessel in which to bring the larvae home. There he saw many 
small wrigglers in an old dirty tin pan which had been filled with 
water from rain coming through a hole in the roof. With com 
mendable discrimination, he left the incidens larvae and brought 



* The young stages of C. consobrinus as sent me are quite unlike the 
corresponding stages of C. incidens. But I have not yet bred C. conso 
brinus myself and still feel some doubt about it.

home those from the shack. They proved to be a pure culture 
of C. varipalpus. 

The larva most nearly resembles that of C. atropalpus, being 
furnished with long anal appendages and a short breathing tube, 
while they wriggle slowly at the bottom of their dish, not coining 
to the surface for a long time. They differ from C. atropalpus 
in that the ventral brush of the last segment is a sessile tuft of 
hairs like the dorsal one, without barred area. The general 
habitus of the larva suggests Wyeomyia smithii. 

Culex territans Walker. 

The larvas were found in permanent pools by the edge of a 
small lake, showing the normal appearance and habits. The 
adults made no attempt to bite. Mr. Currie went down to the 
edge of the lake and secured several by sweeping, but otherwise 
all those secured were bred. 

Culex dyari Coquillett. 

This is a very early species and by no means common. On 
May 29, immediately after my arrival at Kaslo, I found one 
larva in a slow, cold stream in the woods. It pupated at once ; 
so that even at that date the species had practically ceased breed 
ing. No more larvae were found and no adults seen. 

Culex tarsalis Coquillett 

Two examples only occurred at Kaslo, one having entered my 
room at the hotel, the other being taken at night while out sugaring 
for moths. Larvae were found in a pool of permanent fresh 
water near the sea at Victoria, B. C. They were mixed with 
C. incidens. The larva belongs to the long-tubed group, with 
the antennal tuft at the outer third of the joint, the antennas 
broadly white banded, it falls in the synoptic table with C. 
nigritulus,* but the air tube is not so long. The eggs were not 
observed and may prove to be something unusual. 

Culex perturbans Walker. 

A single example was taken by Mr. Currie near the little lake. 
The species was too rare for us to learn anything of its life 
history. 

Culex curriei Coquillett. 

Likewise a single example, taken by Mrs. Dyar near Kaslo 
Creek. This species also was too rare for us to obtain eggs or 
learn anything of the larva. 

*Not the European nigritulus. Mr. Coquillett has proposed a new 
name for the American species, culex salinarius, Ent. News, xv, p. 73, 
1904.

Culex spenceri Theobald. 

Two captured specimens at Kaslo ; oneby Mr. Currie June 13, 
the other by myself June 24. 

Culex consobrinus Desvoidy. 
One captured specimen, July 3. 

Anopheles maculipennis Meigen. 

One male specimen taken in the hotel at Revelstoke, possibly 
brought there on one of the trains. No larvae were seen. 

Aedes fuscus Osten Sacken. 

Very scarce. It was only met with in one instance, flying 
near some pools on a hillside above the lake. Three examples 
were taken which had come out from the shelter of the bushes 
to bite. 

Corethra velutina Ruthe. 

Larvae occurred in a small pool cut off from the little lake, 
mixed with Culex territans, on which they not improbably fed. 
The larva has a breathing tube and air bubbles in its enlarged, 
quadrate thorax, as in the figures of this species from Europe. 

Sayomyia trivittata Say. 

Larvae occurred in a neighboring pool to the preceding and 
even in the little lake itself. The queer, transparent, ghost-like 
things have been figured by me elsewhere.* 

Eucorethra underwood! Underwood. 

The larvae were found in various pools, principally with Culex 
impiger, but also with C. incidens. When the mosquito larvae 
were abundant enough to feed them, they generally grew up 
rapidly and matured in July. In other cases, after they had 
eaten all the mosquito larvae from a pool, they lingered till late 
in the season. At Kaslo they were in the cold pools; at Glacier 
in similar situations, but at Wellington, B. C., I found them in a 
rain-water barrel. This species is much more injurious to 
mosquito larvae than Corethra and Sayomyia because of its 
large size and the fact that it seems to eat nothing else. It has 
been described by Underwood and Johannsen. 



Dr. Howard, in commenting upon Dr. Dyar's paper, said it 
was interesting to compare the number of species (20) found 
by Dr. Dyar in British Columbia with the number observed by 

*Journ. N. Y. Ent. Soc., x, p. 201, 1902. 



42 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

entomologists in other parts of the country. Mr. Frederick 
Knab, in the vicinity of Chicopee, Massachusetts, and Mr. O. A. 
Johannsen at Ithaca, New York, had collected each fourteen 
species ; Miss Isabel McCracken had obtained sixteen species 
around Palo Alto, California ; Messrs. Morgan and Dupree, in 
Louisiana, had brought together twenty-one species ; while Dr. 
J. B. Smith had listed thirty-three species as occurring in the 
State of New Jersey, and had bred all but two of them. From 
these results it is evident that the number of mosquitoes to be 
found in any one locality is much larger than was formerly im 
agined. 

Mr. Schwarz stated that during his recent stay in Cuba during 
February and March, he did not find mosquitoes abundant. He 
tried to collect all the specimens which came to bite him, how 
ever, and these represent six different specie^ as determined by 
Mr. Coquillett. He remarked that the scarcity of mosquitoes in 
Cuba, in early spring, was in marked contrast to the abundance 
of one species (Culex nanus Coquillett), at Key West, at the 
same season. 



NOVEMBER iS. 1903. 

The iSist regular meeting was held at the residence of Mr. J. 
D. Patten, 2212 R street, N.W. Vice-President Banks occu 
pied the chair, and Messrs. Ashmead, Barber, Benton, Caudell, 
Dyar, Felt, Gill, Heidemann, Hopkins, Howard, Kotinsky, Pat 
ten, Schwarz, J. B. Smith, Summers, Uhler, Warner and Weed, 
members, and Messrs. Britton, Burgess, Surface, Trainer and 
\Velch, visitors, also present. 

Prof. Uhler spoke informally about the distribution of the 
Hemiptera in the West Indies. He said that about 7 species 
were known to him from that region, a great number of these 
being still undescribed. The character of this fauna is, of course, 
that of Central America, many of the species being identical 
with those found in Yucatan and the southern portions of the 
Central American continent, about five per cent, occurring 
within the limits of the United States. The real tropical ele 
ment of this fauna occupies the lowlands, whereas at an altitude 



OF WASHINGTON. 43 

of about 5,000 feet the more temperate life-zone prevails. From 
what is known of the fauna of Porto Rico, which is represented 
in the U. S. National Museum by the collection of Mr. August 
Busck, the island should be included in the group known as the 
Greater Antilles. It is a notable fact that the fauna of the north 
ern half of this island differs distinctly from that of the southern 
half. 

Mr. Schwarz concurred with Prof. Uhler in his opinion that 
Porto Rico should be included in the Greater Antilles, and not 
in the Lesser Antilles, where it has been placed by the Zoologi 
cal Record. He said that, in referring to the ca~rd catalogue of 
West Indian Coleoptera made by the late Mr. M. L. Linell, he 
found that Haiti might be considered the central point for the 
species peculiar to the West Indies. The chain of islands to the 
southward contains a large proportion of truly Central American 
and tropical forms whereas the Greater Antilles contain many 
genera and species found also in our southern States. 

Prof. Uhler said he agreed with Mr. Schwarz that the geo 
logical formation of the Greater Antilles showed that it was at 
one time connected with Yucatan as a part of the North Ameri 
can continent. 

Mr. Schwarz presented a paper entitled "A Census of the 
Collection of West Indian Coleoptera at the U. S. National 
Museum." Although the National Museum had, he said, never 
sent an entomological exploration excursion to the West Indies, 
and had never purchased any West Indian material, yet it had 
accumulated from various sources, and mainly by the help of the 
Department of Agriculture, a fair collection of the West Indian 
Coleoptera. About the time the Riley collection was presented 
to the Museum, a large part of the collections of the Department 
of Agriculture and those of Prof. John B. Smith and Mr. M. L. 
Linell were also turned over to the Museum, but only a few 
West Indian species were found in the old collection as made up 
from these sources, and up to 1894 there were only 136 species 
of West Indian Coleoptera in the National Museum. One im 
portant addition was made by the transfer of the H. G. Hubbard 
collection. Mr. Hubbard visited Jamaica in 1886 and the is 
land of Montserrat in 1894. In Jamaica he, collected 172 spe- 



44 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

cies, a complete set of which was sent for determination to Mon 
sieur August Salle in Paris. Only a few of them were deter 
mined by Salle and none returned. The Salle collection has 
recently been bought by the British government and the material 
is now in the British Museum. On the island of Montserrat Mr. 
Hubbard collected about the same number of species, all of them 
being of small size. A set of these, also, were sent toM. Salle 
but hardly any determinations were received from him ; never 
theless a complete set of this collection is now preserved in the 
National Museum. 

From 1894 to 1898 the only additions were such as came to 
the Department of Agriculture by correspondence. It was a 
notable fact, he said, that although two North American ento 
mologists, namely, Prof. T. D. A. Cockerell and Prof. C. H. 
Tyler Townsend, occupied official positions in Kingston, Jamaica, 
the Department of Agriculture received only a few species of 
Coleoptera from them. 

Since the Spanish-American War by far the greatest part of 
the collection has been added by the parties sent out by the De 
partment of Agriculture for making certain investigations of an 
economic nature. Most notable among them are the expeditions 
of Mr. August Busck to Porto Rico and Cuba and of Mr. E. A. 
Schwarz to Cuba. Two other expeditions, however, made con 
siderable additions to the Museum collection, namely, that of 
Messrs. Stejneger and Richmond to Porto Rico and that of 
Messrs. Palmer and Riley to Cuba. The expenses of these two 
expeditions were defrayed by the appropriation for the Pan- 
American Exposition. 

Mr. Schwarz then presented an enumeration of the material 
in the Museum, arranged according to the different islands. He 
referred to the works of Dr. Juan Gundlach on the faunae of 
Cuba and Porto Rico, and complained that these works were so 
little known and so litttle referred to by entomologists although 
they contained many original notes on special localities, mode of 
occurrence and early stages, especially in the Lepidoptera. 

As to the insect fauna of the Bahama Islands, Mr. Schwarz 
referred to the almost entire lack of literature. There is, how 
ever, in the National Museum, a small collection of Bahama 



OF WASHINGTON. 45 

Coleoptera made by him while on a visit to the island at the ex 
pense of the Department of Agriculture. The subtropical part 
of Florida must, of course, also be included in the West Indian 
fauna, and of this fauna there is an almost complete representa 
tion in the National Museum, amounting to about 200 species. 
The total of the West Indian collection of Coleoptera in the 
National Museum foots up to about 1,160 species. Linell's card 
catalogue, referred to above, includes 919 West Indian species, 
and Mr. Schwarz, in completing that catalogue, has brought up 
the total of described West Indian species to about 2,240 an ex 
tremely small number when compared with the 2^,000 species 
described from the Central American continent and the 13,000 
species described from North America. The number of species 
known from the adjacent portions of South America could not 
then be given. 

Mr. Summers stated that he had, several years ago, brought 
200 or 300 species of Coleoptera from Grenada, where he was 
collecting with Mr. Herbert H. Smith. He was not interested 
in Coleoptera, however, and had put away what he collected. 
Most of this material had been destroyed by pests since then, 
unfortunately, but he promised to donate to the Museum what 
still remained of them. Dr. Hopkins, also, promised to add two 
or three species to the Grenada fauna in the Museum. 

Prof. Smith gave some of his experiences during the time 
when he was Assistant Curator of the Department of Insects in 
the Museum, beginning in iSS^, and mentioned the material, 
both in Coleoptera and Lepidoptera, which formed the nuclei of 
the Museum collections in those orders. He said that most prob 
ably a certain number of West Indian specimens which Mr. 
Schwarz mentioned as a part of the old Museum collection came 
from his private collection and had been purchased by him with 
the old Schaupp collection. Mr. Schwarz then said that the 
labels of the specimens referred to by Prof. Smith were in a 
French handwriting and came very probably from the old Chev- 
rolat collection which contained the material collected by Mr. 
Felipe Poey. 

Mr. Caudell stated that Gundlach's work was not mentioned 
in the writings of either Scudder or Rehn. Prof. Uhler re- 



46 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

marked that it was impossible to buy a copy of it ; he knew of 
only two copies in this country, one in New York and the other 
in Washington. Mr. Ash mead said he had experienced great 
difficulty in getting access to the works on South American in 
sects by Spanish authors in South America. 



Mr. Caudell read the following paper : 

AN ORTHOPTEROUS LEAF-ROLLER. 
By A. N. CAUDEI.L. 

Early in July, 1900, while collecting in the vicinity of Wash 
ington, D. C., I found a small papaw leaf neatly rolled by some 
insect. Upon opening it I was surprised to see a very small 
apterous orthopteron leap actively out, losing itself immediately 
among the leaves on the ground. On close search I found on 
the same plant another exactly similarly rolled leaf. Upon peer 
ing into this very cautiously I found that it contained a specimen 
like the one just lost. From an examination of the specimen 
within the case I could only determine that it was a delicate, 
pale colored Locustid with very long slender antennae, apparently 
a very young specimen. This was preserved, but, not being at 
that time interested in Orthoptera, 1 made no notes, nor did I 
then know that the leaf was rolled by this insect. 

On May 22, 1902, Mr. Busck handed me a small jar contain 
ing some bits of willow bark and two Locustid nymphs. Upon 
closely examining the material I found three eggs in a crevice in 
a piece of bark, two empty, obviously those from which the 
nymphs had issued, and one shriveled up, evidently destroyed 
by fungus. The nymphs were identified as those of Campto- 
notus carolinensis Gerst. The piece of bark containing these 
eggs was taken about two feet above ground from a large tree. 
Placing one of these nymphs in spirits I enclosed the other in a 
glass tube with some willow leaves covered with plant lice. On 
examing this tube the following day I found the insect had con 
structed for itself a pocket in one of the leaves, and then I recog 
nized without doubt the same insect I had taken two years before 
on papaw. The pocket was made by cutting the leaf through 
on each side to the midrib and at right angles to it and again one- 
third of an inch further along the midrib, this time the incision 
being formed at an angle with it. The flaps thus formed on either 
side were then folded together and their edges fastened together 
with silk-like strands, and I have subsequently seen cases with 



OF WASHINGTON. 47 

one end completely closed by a solid mat of this silk. The man 
ner of constructing the pockets or rolls is not uniform. In some 
cases the incisions are made near the apex of the leaf and then only 
the two basal cuts are made, the tip of the leaf being folded back, 
thus making the terminal cuts unnecessary. Sometimes the 
pocket is formed altogether on one side of the midrib. Mr. 
Busck luckily observed the formation of one of the pockets and 
thus describes the process : 

" When supplied with fresh leaves the insect at once com 
menced making a new house, cutting with its mandibles incisions 
from the edge of the leaf; then, grasping the thus movable 
edges each with the three legs on each side and forcing 
them together, it spun what was apparently silk thread from the 
mouth, fastening the edges together. The whole performance 
did not take five minutes after it was begun. The insect accur 
ately measured the proper places for the cuts by placing itself 
on the leaf and realizing how much space was needed. This 
being determined, the work went rapidly on." 

Within these pockets the nymphs live, coming out mostly at 
night to feed on plant lice, which seem to form their entire food 
supply during their early life. In confinement they will eat other 
insects as Mr. Busck reports a specimen as eating at least one 
young leaf hopper. In two days one I had under observation ate 
a dozen large rose aphids, several willow lice and innumerable 
smaller lice. It increased in length from four to five millimeters 
in three days. Leaving the city at this point my interesting captive 
was turned over to Mr. Banks who conscientiously fed and cared 
for it until the 3Oth of May, when he unfortunately lost it while 
attempting to transfer it from one jar to another. 

From notes myde by Mr. Banks this insect seems to be princi 
pally a night prowler. It feeds mostly at night though it will nt 
times feed quite readily during the day. The following notes are 
taken for the most part from those made by Mr. Banks : 

There is apparently no choice in the kind of leaves used for 
making the rolls. On May 26th it formed one in a honey-suckle 
leaf. The exact manner of forming the roll, which was on only 
one side of the midrib, was not noted. On May 27th, after dark, 
when given some aphids from honey-suckle and maple, its feed 
ing was observed by the light of a lamp. It seized an aphid, 
bit it, turned it about by means of the palpi, and then proceeded 
to eat it entirely up, skin and all. Then it walked nervously 
around, palpi quivering, till it came close to another aphid, 
which it seized by the back, sucked out the juices and then ate 
the skin. Seven large aphids were thus eaten in a short time. 
On May 29th another pocket was formed and the insect appeared 
on that date to have grown considerably, showing indications of 



48 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

having molted, though no cast skin could be found. It is quite pos 
sible that the insect eats the cast skins of the earlier molts as is done 
in the case of some other Locustidse, Microcentrtim for example. 

This spring another attempt was made to rear this species from 
the egg, but I had to leave for British Columbia and failure re 
sulted. It is to be regretted that the life cycle of this interesting 
insect could not have been completed, but, since so much is 
known, it is to be hoped that the near future will see the com 
pletion of the life history. Later in life its food habits doubt 
lessly change, probably becoming essentially vegetarian. Though 
no adults were secured from these experiments there is practically 
no doubt of the determination, the generic characters being plainly 
indicated in the nymph and there being but this one species known 
from the United States. 

Under the name Camptonotus scudderi this insect is said by- 
Prof. Uhler* to occur on oak trees about Baltimore in the larval 
state as early as the first of August, and as adults from the latter 
part of September until sometime in October. Mature specimens 
were taken by Mr. Barber on Plummer's Island, Md., on September 
10, 1902. 

While the nymph of this species has been mentioned by sev 
eral writers, no reference to its feeding habits has been published 
so far as I can learn. Riley, in a popular account of the insect 
on page 186, volume II, of the Standard Natural History, says 
it hides in a rolled leaf during the day with its long antennae 
wrapped several times around the body. It is possible that it is 
only during the younger stages that it forms these rolls. The 
young nymphs are very active and run about rapidly. They 
seldom jump except when disturbed, though capable of leaping 
a considerable distance. 

The egg and first stage nymph of this species may be described 
as follows : 

Egg. Size, 1.25 mm. wide by 4.25 mm. long. Shape round, obtusely 
pointed at each end; the surface, when seen through a lens, has a regu 
larly beaded appearance. The color of the egg after the insect has issued 
is pallid with the extremities infuscated, but before hatching they may be 
colored, probably greenish. The young insect issues through a small 
trap cut in one end. This door is made by a longitudinal split on one 
side, which at the lower end intersects at right angles a transverse frac 
ture which extends a fourth of the distance around the egg at about one 
millimeter from the end. 

ist stage nymph. Head long and typically locustian. Eyes oblong, 
dark brown in color; palpi pale, white at the tips; apical segment of the 

* Proc Ent. Soc. Philadelphia, n, p 549, 1864. 



OF WASHINGTON. 49 

maxillary palpi white on the apical half and brown on the basal half, the 
whole very slightly longer than the penultimate segment; antennae situ 
ated between the eyes and below the median line; the segments beyond 
the first, which is twice as long as the second, subequal in length and 
gradually growing smaller at the tip where the antenna is as fine as a fine 
hair, the whole antenna brownish in color and covered sparsely with short 
microscopic hairs. The entire insect is of a very light brown below, al 
most white, growing darker above, almost fuscous dorsally on the meso- 
and metanota which are both visible behind the medium sized quadrate 
prothorax. This latter is scarcely as wide as the head, truncate anteriorly 
and broadly rounded posteriorly with weakly-developed lateral lobes. 
The abdomen, which is slightly pyriform. shows ten dorsal segments, the 
terminal one scarcely visible between the bases of the divergent cerci. The 
legs are pale brownish, paler beneath and with pallid geniculations. The 
tarsi are also pallid. Anal cerci flesh colored, scarcely as long as the last 
three abdominal segments. 

Length of body, from front of head to the tip of the abdomen, 4 mm. ; 
of antennae, 20 mm. ; hind femora, 2 mm. 



Mr. Caudell was asked whether he considered the orthopteron 
a true silk-spinning insect, and he replied that he thought the 
material used in fastening the roll might be simply dried saliva. 
Mr. Banks said he thought the spinning material might properly 
be called silk. Dr. Howard suggested that fresh specimens 
should be dissected to see whether there were true spinning or 
gans. Prof. Uhler stated that he had collected this insect near 
Baltimore by beating it from trees. 

Mr. Kotinsky showed specimensof a scale-insect (Lecantum 
hemisphericum Targ.), which were found on a plant sent in to 
the Department of Agriculture. Curiously enough some of them, 
during transit, had transferred and fastened themselves to the 
dryers in which the plants were pressed and had there laid eggs. 

Mr. Caudell exhibited specimens of a West Indian cricket 
{Anurogryllus antillarum Saussure). This insect is injurious 
to various crops in the South, where it has been known for many 
years, although it has never been referred to in print nor listed 
as belonging to our fauna. 

Mr. Barber exhibited specimens of the rare and curious 
neuropteroid insect, Merope tuber Newman, collected the past 
summer at Plummer's Island, Maryland, and presented the fol 
lowing note :

THE OCCURRENCE OF THE EARWIG-FLY, MEROPE 
TUBER NEWMAN. 

(NEUROPTERA, PANORPID^E.) 
By HERBERT S. BARBER. 

There is, perhaps, no more interesting species among North 
American Neuropteroid insects than this singular Panorpid. Its 
great rarity, together with the fact that its habits are entirely un 
known, may make the present records interesting to some. It is 
hoped that more data may be obtained the coming season. 

Newman's type of the species, a female, was found by Double- 
day at Trenton Falls, N. Y., in 1837. Sixteen years later, 
July 1 6, 1853, Dr. Asa Fitch captured a female, which had 
been attracted by the light of his candle, at Salem, N. Y. This 
specimen is preserved in the U. S. National Museum. Hagen, 
in his " Synopsis of the Neuroptera of North America," pub 
lished in 1 86 1, gives two localities Berkeley Springs, Virginia * 
(Osten Sackent), and Pennsylvania. On July 28, 1871, Dr. 
Fitch found his second specimen, a male, " Running on papers 
on office table, evening, having entered at the open door, prob 
ably."! He published a very full account and description of the 
species in his fourteenth report, but seems not to have known 
of Hagen's paper. He captured his third and last specimen, a 
female, on August 24, 1877, and says of it : " Same as preced 
ing, and making short flights in the lamplight. "j| Fitch's sec 
ond and third captures appear to be lost. 

On August 22, 1886, Mr. E. A. Schwarz found a male speci 
men, as published in the columns of our Proceedings, f under 
a stone in what is now the Zoological Park of this city. Late in 
the summer of 1898 Mr. O. F. Cook found a female specimen 
near Tvlt. Vernon, Ya., also under a stone, and a few years ago 
Mr. Nathan Banks captured a female at light, at Falls Church, 
Va. Hine, in his Review of the Panorpidae of America, north 
of Mexico,** adds Orono, Me., ft to the habitat, but gives no 
further data.

Last summer the following specimens were taken in this 
vicinity all at light except one which evidently had come to 
light the previous evening : Mr. Schwarz captured a male on 
Plummer's Island, Md., on June 19. Mr. Busck took one male 
and two females, and saw a fourth example all within three 
or four minutes of each other on Plummer's Island, September 
9, about 10 o'clock in the evening. He found another female 
at the same place about 7 P. M. on September n, and still 
another female, dead but still soft, in his house at Langdon, 
D. C., September 18, 1903. 

We now have records, therefore, of sixteen specimens seven in 
the National Museum Collection ; two in Mr. Bank's Collection ; 
one, the type, in the British Museum ; three in the collection 
of the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Cambridge, Mass. ; 
one in Mr. Cook's Collection and, lastly, the two missing speci 
mens from the Fitch Collection.

In the paper under the above heading, which appeared on 
pages 245 to 272 of Volume Vof these Proceedings, it was stated 
several times that the writer had been unable to consult a copy 
of Macquart's " Insectes Dipteres du Nord de la France," separate 
edition. This work has recently been obtained for the library of 
the U. S. Department of Agriculture by the efficient Librarian, 
Miss Josephine A. Clark, and I am thus enabled to make the 
following supplementary remarks and corrections to the article 
in question : 

Page 246, under Ardoptera. Macquart mentioned only the 
one species given in his later work. 

Page 249, under Elaphropeza. Only the single species was 
mentioned.

species was mentioned by Macquart.

the second being velutinus. 

Page 255, under Platy palpus. Eighteen species were de 
scribed, of which cursitans was the fourteenth. 

The data given in my paper in regard to this separate edition 
were chiefly derived from Macquart's later works ; several of these

references are erroneous and have been corrected in the errata in 
serted at the end of the volume in which the paper appeared. 

I may add that Dr. M. Bezzi, of Sondrio, Italy, writes me that 
Holoclera is a synonym of Macrostomus, and that the type 
species of the former is a synonym of Rhamphomyia umbri- 
pennis Meigen. 

Mr. Welsh, who was then introduced to the Society by Dr. 
Howard, exhibited a large Cerambycid beetle, Macrotoma luzo- 
num Fabricius, and a carpenter bee taken by him in the Philip 
pine Islands. Mr. Ashmead identified the carpenter bee as 
Xylocopa bombiforniis Smith, a species in which the males have 
until recently been unknown, being of quite different aspect from 
the females. The females are bluish black and the males 
yellowish green.

ANNUAL ADDRESS OF THE PRESIDENT. 



A BRIEF HISTORY OF NORTH AMERICAN DIPTEROLOGY. 
By D. W. Coqyii.LETT. 

In searching for a topic that promised to be of some interest 
to the members of this Society, it occurred to me that perhaps a 
brief history of the science of Dipterology as it applies to this 
country might not be wholly devoid of interest, the more so as 
nothing of this kind has been attempted within recent years. 

In so far as this science affects our fauna, it had its inception 
in the year 1763; in that year the immortal Linne described a 
single Dipteron from Pennsylvania under the name of Asilus 
astuans, a species now placed in the genus Erax. Not only 
was it the first member of this order from our fauna to be hon 
ored with a name and description, but it also enjoys the distinc 
tion of being the first Dipteron described from any country outside 
of Europe. 

The time extending from the year above mentioned down to 
the present may be conveniently divided into three epochs. The 
first of these was terminated by the advent of the first published 
description of a North American Dipteron by an American 
author; this occurred in the year 1817, when the equally im 
mortal Thomas Say published a description of a single new 
species of Diptera, likewise from Pennsylvania, under the name 
of Diopsis brevicornis^ for which he later erected the new genus 
Sphyracephala. This first epoch, covering a period of 54 
years, witnessed an even dozen foreign writers describe new 
forms of Diptera from the United States. Among these are such 
noted authors as Linne, Fabricius, De Geer, Drury and Olivier. 

The second epoch comprises the time from the appearance of 



54 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

this first paper by Say to the advent of a distinctively American 
Dipterologist in the person of Dr. S. W. Williston, whose initial 
descriptive paper appeared in the year 1880 and contained de 
scriptions of three new species Rhynckocephalus sackcnii, Sil- 
vius pollinosits and Chrysops discalis all of them inhabitants 
of the western half of this country. During this second epoch, 
which covered a period of 63 years, no less than 40 different 
authors published descriptions of new forms of Diptera from the 
United States. Of this number, fifteen, or more than one-third 
of the whole, were Americans. In making this calculation I have 
included those who, although of foreign birth, have taken up 
their residence among us and remained here during the balance 

o o 

of their natural lives. Of this latter number are B. D. Walsh 
and Dr. H. A. Hagen, both of whom, during the latter part of 
their lives, were essentially citizens of this country. Students of 
all the orders, but more particularly those engaged in the study 
of our Diptera, could wish to include Baron Osten Sacken in this 
category ; his long residence among us, his active interest in all 
branches of entomology, but especially in our Diptera as is 
evidenced not only by his published writings, but also by the 
presence in this country, within easy reach of our students, of 
the collection containing the type specimens of the species de 
scribed by Dr. H. Loew and himself, for which we are indebted 
to his careful foresight and unremitting efforts in our behalf 
have combined to give to that distinguished Dipterologist a place 
among us not enjoyed by any other citizen of other lands. 

While, during this second epoch, our Dipterological literature 
has been enriched by contributions from the pens of such mas 
ters as Say, Wiedemann, Schiner, Osten Sacken and Loew, we 
have also been inflicted by such indifferent workers as Desvoidy, 
Bigot and Walker. Among the Dipterologists of this period 
who have completed their earthly careers, the name of J. R. 
Schiner, of Austria, must be accorded a very exalted place ; not 
only did he possess in a marked degree the faculty of discerning 
the most striking differences existing between the different ob 
jects which he described, but he also had the happy faculty of 
expressing them in words that admitted of no misunderstanding 
of the idea he intended to convey, while his conscientiousness was 



OF WASHINGTON". 55 

apparent in all of his acts. On the other hand, at the very bot 
tom of the list, one would be inclined to place the ubiquitous 
Robineau-Desvoidy ; while his larger groups show some ap 
proach to a natural arrangement, his conception of a genus and 
species and his futile attempts at describing them, are as unsatis 
factory as they well could be, and it is therefore -not at all sur 
prising that Rondani (a genius in his way, as is more particu 
larly evidenced by his masterly treatment of the family Antho- 
myidae, one of the most obscure and difficult groups in the whole 
order), after recording the names of several of Desvoidy's sup 
posed species as synonyms of some well-known form, not infre 
quently placed a suggestive " etc.'' after the last one, indicating 
that several more names from the same source could be added ad 
libitum. 

Wiedemann, who was a contemporary of Say, was the first 
writer to pollute our nomenclature of the Diptera by changing 
several of the valid specific names imposed by Say ; sometimes 
this pollution was simply a matter of one or two letters, at other 
times the entire name was changed for no other apparent reason 
than that the new one was more descriptive of the species than 
was the original. Loew followed Wiedemann in this unfortu 
nate respect, and, being a more prolific writer, the mischief which 
he wrought was correspondingly greater. Unfortunately, these 
polluted names have been given the place of the valid ones in 
Osten Sacken's otherwise excellent catalogue of our Diptera, and 
later writers, with few exceptions, have followed the catalogue 
as a matter of expediency. 

This polluting of the nomenclature comes down to us from the 
very beginning of our binomial system. It was the custom of 
Linne, in the subsequent editions of his works, to occasionally 
change the names which he had previously bestowed upon cer 
tain species, sometimes simply changing the manner of spelling, 
but at other times an entirely different name was substituted, and 
in rare cases the old name was transferred to a totally different 
species. Considering the fact that he wrote at a time when 
science was just beginning to free itself from fiction, his actions 
can perhaps be condoned ; but at the present time there would 
appear to be no excuse either for polluting the valid names im 
posed by the original describers or for using such polluted names 



56 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

in preference to the valid ones. The name of the genus, or spe 
cies as imposed bv its first describer is a matter of much historic 
and scientific moment ; what any person's opinion is as to what 
the name ought to have been is a matter of no importance, and 
belongs rather to the realm of fiction than to pure science. 
Students in this country almost without exception are agreed that 
only in the case of preoccupation is there a valid excuse for 
changing the name of a genus or species, and then, in the case 
of a genus, the name to be changed must be identical letter for 
letter with the earlier name. 

Shortly after the advent of Dr. Williston upon the scene, quite 
a number of our students began to seriously study our Diptera 
and to record the result of their studies in our various journals 
and other publications ; in fact, nearly all that has been published 
on our species within recent years has been the work of our own 
students. This is certain to result in a better understanding of 
these insects than was possible'under the old regime, since it must 
be apparent to all that the student who studies his subjects in the 
field as well as in the laboratory, and who is in a position to col 
lect the specimens in large numbers, will obtain a more correct 
idea of the limits of a species and is also in a position to more 
accurately interpret the older descriptions which relate to his 
fauna, than any student in a distant land. This latter fact is 
clearly set forth in a comparison of two monographs which deal 
with our Diptera, the one written by Doctor Loew, an author 
who had never even visited our shores, the other by Doctor Willis- 
ton, who was born and brought up among the objects of which 
he wrote. In the first work, a " Monograph of the Dolicho- 
podidse," of the 60 descriptions of species from the United 
States published by previous authors, only 8, or less than one- 
seventh of the entire number, were recognized by Loew, while 
the remaining species he described as new. There is, of course, 
no grounds for doubting the fact that a large proportion of the 
latter are identical with those described by the older authors, and 
consequently these species have ever since been sailing under 
false colors, while their valid names have been permitted to encum 
ber our lists as a useless, meaningless mass, and thus they must re 
main until some conscientious student from this country again 
gives this family a careful revision, as a result of which a large per- 



OF WASHINGTON. 57 

centage of these old names will be restored to their rightful places. 
In strong contrast to this makeshift and unsatisfactory method is 
the result obtained by Doctor Williston, as indicated in his " Syn 
opsis of the North American Syrphidse;" of the 223 descriptions 
of species from the United States, to the type specimens of which 
he did not have access, he succeeded in identifying 170, or more 
than three-fourths of the whole number, as compared to less 
than one-seventh, in the case of Dr. Loew. After due allow 
ances are made, the result is very much in favor of the man upon 
the ground. 

There is an unfortunate tendency, particularly among new re 
cruits, to describe at once as new all forms that do not agree in 
all respects with existing descriptions as they interpret them. 
The identifying of species from published descriptions is always 
attended with a certain degree of uncertainty, and unless one has 
access to representatives of all the species described in a given 
group it is advisable to label the specimen with the name of the 
species with the description of which it most nearly agrees, 
placing a question mark before the specific name. It is only 
when one has access to practically all the forms occurring in a 
given region that he is in a position to correctly interpret the 
published descriptions of species from that region. In several 
cases the descriptions contain actual misstatements a fact that 
should not be overlooked when identifying species from descrip 
tions onlv. 

The present epoch has also witnessed a notable advance in our 
knowledge of the early stages of at least a portion of our Diptera ; 
this was inaugurated by Dr. L. O. Howard in his studies of 
our mosquitoes, a work in which he has been ably seconded by 
the patient labors of Dr. H. G. Dyar, Dr. J. B. Smith, Prof. 
O. A. Johannsen, and a few others. Dr. Dyar has described 
and figured the early stages of nearly every kind of mosquito 
that has come within his reach, while Dr. Smith informs me that 
during the last two seasons he has obtained the early stages of 31 
of the 33 species known to inhabit New Jersey a remarkable 
achievement, indicative of what may be accomplished in other 
groups by continuous, well-directed efforts. In the list of the 
insects of New Jersey, published only three years ago, only ten 



58 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

species of Culicidae were credited to that State less than one- 
third of the number now known to occur there. 

This increased interest in the early stages of our Diptera is cer 
tain to result in a better understanding of these insects ; no mat 
ter how expert a student may become in separating the adults into 
their proper species, it is not until we obtain a knowledge of all 
of the early stages of any given form that its status as a species 
becomes fully established, and it is to be hoped that investiga 
tions in this direction will be continued until the early stages of 
every Dipteron in our fauna has been made known. 



The presidential address was favorably commented upon by 
Messrs. Ulke, Kotinsky, Ashmead, Schwarz, Gill and others. 
Mr. Ulke stated that he was indebted to Dr. Loew for his first 
knowledge of real insect collecting, the latter having, some sev 
enty years ago, visited his father's home, in Germany, and shown 
him the method of using the various implements employed in in 
sect collecting. Dr. Gill said that he agreed with Mr. Coquillett 
that a generic name should be considered as preoccupied only 
when the previously proposed name agreed with it exactly, letter 
for letter. He remarked, however, that many, perhaps the 
majority, of systematists would take issue with him on this point. 

Dr. Hopkins read a paper entitled " Notes on the Scolytidae 
of the Fitch Collection," and exhibited specimens from the Fitch 
collection in the National Museum. He referred to the note 
books examined by him in the library of the Boston Society of 
Natural History, and called attention to Fitch's method of num 
bering and labeling specimens. The collection represents twenty- 
four species, including five which are still undescribed. The 
species were identified and arranged by Dr. Hopkins, in his 
paper, according to his manuscript Synopsis and Check-List of 
the Scolytidae of America north of Mexico. He thought best, 
therefore, to withhold the paper from publication until the syn 
opsis shall have been published. 

Mr. Ulke said that he saw Fitch some fifty years ago. The reason 
there were so many wrongly named Coleoptera in the Fitch col 
lection was because Fitch had been unable to secure any help 
from coleopterists. Fitch told him that he had written repeatedly 



OF WASHINGTON". 59 

to Dr. LeConte asking his co-operation in determining the 
species in his collection, but had received no reply. He, there 
fore, worked almost entirely unaided, gave names to such species 
as he could identify, and labelled all others with his own manu 
script names. 

Mr. Schwarz stated that there were various things concerning 
Fitch's collection and Fitch's types, which seem to be unknown 
to many of our younger entomologists. He more especially 
referred to the insects sold by Dr. Fitch to the New York State 
Agricultural Society and which are now in the New State 
Museum at Albany. This collection probably does not contain 
any type specimens whatever. What is a type in the Fitch col 
lection can only be ascertained by consulting Fitch's note-books. 
Six of these note-books, with the corresponding boxes of the 
original Fitch collection, were bought many years ago by the 
U.S. Department of Agriculture and are now in the U. S. Na 
tional Museum. The record of the types, as given by Dr. Riley 
in Lintner's paper on the Fitch collection,* is correct. The 
rema : ning note-books of Fitch became separated from the Fitch 
collection, and some of them are now in the possession of the 
Boston Society of Natural History. The others seem to be lost. 
The remnant of the Fitch collection of insects was finally pur 
chased by the Department of Agi'culture, but proved to be in a 
very deplorable state of preservation. 

The subject of Fitch's types, and types in general, was further 
discussed by Messrs. Ashmead, Hopkins, Titus, Schwarz, Dyar 
and Banks. 

Dr. Dyar handed the following articles to the Secretary for 
publication : 

A NEW VARIETY OF THE NOCTUID EXYRA 
SEMICROCEA GUENEE. 

{Exyra semicrocea, variety hubbardiana, n. var.) 
By HARRISON G. DYAR. 

The usual form of semicrocea has the outer half of the fore 
wings solidly blackish. In hubbardiana this color is largely

faded out and lost, leaving a broad dark band, representing the 
inner edge of the usual patch and a subterminal band, the latter 
situated in a broad, light grayish field, which extends to the 
margin and touches the median band centrally. Two males, De 
Funiak Springs, Florida (H. G. Hubbard), bred on Sarracenia 
flava, mixed with normal semicrocea and with E. ridingsii 
^Riley.

A NEW GENUS AND SPECIES OF TORTRICID^. 

By HARRISON G. DYAR. 
Gymnandrosoma, new genus. 

Palpi rather long, obliquely ascending, second joint only slightly 
widened by scales, third distinct, rounded; $ antennae compressed, mi 
nutely bristled, subserrate ; wings broad, costa arched, without fold in 
the $, veins all separate; vein 2 of the fore wings from near the middle 
of the cell, 3 and 4 approximate at base, 5 more distant, 7 to outer margin, 
8 to costa, separate; hind wings with 3 and 4 connate, 5 remote, nearly 
parallel to 4, 6 and 7 closely approximated at base. Thorax with a double 
truncate tuft behind; abdomen in the (^ with the basal segments of dor- 
sum bare of scales, a pair of pencils of yellowish hair arising from the tip 
of the second segment. Inner margin of hind wings excavated below into 
a large pocket which covers the abdominal hair pencil when the wings 
are closed. 

Allied to Pseudogalleria and Ecdytolopha^ut differing in 
the peculiar position of the d* scent tuft, which is on the abdo 
men instead of in a fold of the wing. 

Gymnandrosoma punctidiscanum, new species. 

Wings roughly scaled, strigose, dark gray from blackish scales heavily 
overlaid on a pale ground, nearly solidly so over the basal two-thirds, 
sometimes over the whole wing, but usually leaving the terminal third 
largely light. A round, punctiform, whitish discal dot, in the males sit 
uated nearly at the edge of the dark basal area which is curved inward 
below the cell. A more or less distinct, maculate, broken submarginal 
band, composed of dark patches with darker edges. Hind wings blackish 
brown.

The 1830! regular meeting was held at the residence of Dr. 
L. O. Howard, 2026 Hillyer Place, N. W. Vice-President 
Hopkins in the chair, and Messrs. Ashmead, Barber, Benton, 
Burke, Busck, Caudell, Currie, Dyar, Fiske, Gill, Hinds, How 
ard, Marlatt, Merrill, Morris, Patten, Quaintance, Scott, Titus, 
Warner and Webb, members, and Messrs. A. Arsene Girault 
and J. F. Strauss, visitors, present. 

Dr. Wm. II . Ashmead was re-elected to represent the Ento 
mological Society in the Washington Academy of Sciences. 

Dr. Howard passed around for examination Volume II, the 
concluding volume, of Newstead's Monograph of the British Coc- 
cidie, recently issued by the Ray Society. He drew attention to 
the fine quality of the illustrations, stating that in his opinion 
they were the best illustrations of Coccidae that have yet been 
published. The majority of the species treated are, he said, 
cosmopolitan. Of thirty-six species treated in Volume I, prob 
ably only three are indigenous to Great Britain. Of especial 
interest are the descriptions of the cW in the genus Lecanium 
and particularly of the cT of L. hesperidum which has not been 
described before. Newstead describes the <$ of this species, in 
the puparium only, from specimens sent him from Bath, Eng 
land. Mr. Albert Koebele, in his correspondence with the De- 



62 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

partment of Agriculture while in Australia in quest of preda- 
ceous enemies of scale insects, stated that there the c?c? of Le- 
canium hesperidum were as abundant as the $ 9 , but he appar 
ently failed to send in any specimens. 

Dr. Ash mead exhibited specimens of a peculiar leaf- sew 
ing ant (CEcophylla smaragdina Fabricius) from the Philip 
pines, together with examples of its work. The method by which 
the leaves are sewed together is most remarkable. The worker 
ants hold their own larvae in their jaws while these spin a fine 
thread that holds the edges of the leaves together. Dr. Ash- 
mead commented on the structural peculiarities of the species. 

Dr. Dyar presented for publication the following papers : 

ADDITIONS TO THE LIST OF NORTH AMERICAN LEPI- 
DOPTERA, NO. i. 

BY HARRISON G. DYAR. 

The following are a few new species that have come to notice 
together with some species here first recorded as belonging to 
our region. 

Family NOCTUID.E. 
Tornacontia mediatrix, n. sp. 

Head dark brown, thorax white, a broad tip to the collar and a pair of 
dots on posterior disk brown-black. Fore wings white, basal space shaded 
with pale leaden gray to beyond t.-a. line, which is white and twice angled 
in one specimen, lost in the other and represented only by the gray shade 
beyond it. A quadrate purplish black patch on the center of inner margin 
reaching to median vein, narrowly separated by awhile line from a broad, 
leaden gray band which runs to costa before apex. Two gray spots on 
costa at points of inception of the obsolete median and t.-p. lines. Orbic 
ular a black dot; reniform a broken black ringlet; a small gray patch at 
apex; a terminal row of black dashes; fringe gray at anal angle and above 
middle of outer margin. Hind wings white, brownish outwardly. Ex 
panse 24 to 25 mm. 

Eight specimens, cf and 9,Huachuca Mts., Arizona (Oslar), 
Las Vegas Hot Springs, New Mexico (Schwarz and Barber). 

Type. No. 7686, U. S. National Museum. 

The species of Tornacontia, at present described, may be 
separated as follows : 



OF WASHINGTON. 63 

Head and thorax white. 

Fore wings with white space below orbicular followed by a blackish 
patch. 

Hind wings all brownish sutrix Grote. 

Hind wings nearly all white altera Smith. 

Fore wings largely leaden gray megocula Smith. 

Head blackish, collar black tipped. 
Fore wing with white space below orbicular followed by a quadrate 

blackish patch mediatrix Dyar. 

Fore wing without discolorous dark patch tripartita Smith. 

Acontia ceyvestensis, n. var. 

Similar to aprim Illibner, but smaller and the head and thorax white. 
Three examples are marked like dprica Hiibner on the wings, two others 
like biplaga Guenee. Expanse 20 to 24 mm. 

Five specimens, Key West, Fla. 

Type. No. 7687, u. S. National Museum. 

I conclude that aprica and biplaga are varieties of one species, 
although Smith has recorded the contrary opinion.* Indeed a 
series of 40 specimens before me shows the two forms to inter- 
grade. One of the specimens from Texas (form aprica} has 
only a little of the dark color left on the vertex of head and thus 
closely approaches the local race ceyvestensis. 

Oncocnemis laticosta, n. sp. 

Thorax blackish, variegated with pale ocherous scales, collar largely of 
the pale color; abdomen light. Fore wings pale ocherous in ground 
color, the inner two-thirds of wing heavily overlaid with blackish, pow 
dery, not obscuring the marks. Lines as in m lalutea Smith, black, 
edged with pal?, crenulate; basal line obsolete, t.-a. slightly arcuate, 
t.-p. bent out beyond cell with white points on veins 2 and 4. Terminal 
space dark shaded, enclosing the pale, broken, irregular subterminal line. 
Ordinary spots pale ocherous, filled by a darker shade; orbicular elongate, 
claviform punctiform, nearly obsolete. A row of terminal black dashes 
outlined by narrow pale arcs. Fringe brown, cut by white, interlined in 
gray. Hind wings white, a smoky narrow outer border, fringe white. 
Expanse 30 mm. 

Five specimens, Jerome, Arizona (Oslar). 

7'ype.No. 7688, U. S. National Museum. 

Nearly allied to melalutea Smith, but differing in the more 
diversified color, the contrasting pale tint of costal area, the 
elongate orbicular and the whiter, more narrowly bordered hind 
wings.

Oncocnemis tetrops, n. sp. 

Head and thorax gray with black scales, collar with white scales before 
and a black line, abdomen light gray. Fore wings dark gray, terminal 
third uniformly blackish, crossed only by the blacker veins ; costal area 
lightened by whitish streaks. Orbicular and reniform black centered, 
white ringed, orbicular elliptical, reniform cut in two by the centering 
black line which touches the end of the orbicular; median vein black with 
a narrow white edge above. There is a black basal dash that apparently 
joins the claviform as in chandleri Grote, but this part of the wing is 
rubbed. Hind wings whitish with a diffuse outer border of pale smoky, a 
dark broken terminal line; fringe white. Expanse 30 mm. 

Five specimens, Jerome, Arizona (Oslar). 
Type. No. 7689, U. S. National Museum. 
Near chandleri Grote, Colorado Smith and oblita Grote, but 
the subterminal line is wholly lost. 

Copablepharon sanctae monicse, n. sp. 

Thorax and fore wings pale ocherous, the thorax before a shade darker; 
abdomen whitish at base, else brown. A black point on median vein and 
on vein i represent t.-a. line; a cluster of black and brown scales at 
origin of veins 3-4; t.-p. line a row of eight elongate black dots; fringe 
pale. Hind wings whitish on inner margin and fringe, disk largely shaded 
with deep brown ; an outer row of elongate black dots on the veins. Ex 
panse 36 mm. 

Two tfc?, Santa Monica, California (J. J. Rivers). 
Type. No. 7690, U. S. National Museum. 

Family NOTODONTI1XE. 

Afilia oslari, n. sp. 

Fore wings with veins 6 to 10 stalked, hind wings with 6 and 7 stalked ; 
otherwise agreeing in structure with the type of the genus. Head and 
thorax dark gray, abdomen ochraceous. Fore wings narrow, gray, basal 
line obscure, lost in the more or less black powdering that fills' the basal 
space. Lines geminate, approximate, black, slightly ochraceous filled, a 
little crenulate or angled, not strong. A curved, lunate, black discal 
dash. Subterminal line smoky, diffuse, black, tending to be broken on 
the veins. A series of terminal oblique intravenular dashes; a black line 
at base of fringe. Hind wings white. Expanse 30 to 32 mm. 

Four specimens, c?cf , Nogales, Arizona (Oslar) ; Guadala 
jara, Mexico (Neumoegen). 

Nv. 7691, U, S, National Museum. 



OF WASHINGTON. 65 

Notela jaliscana Schaus. 

Ten specimens, Nogales and Huachuca Mts., Arizona (Oslar). 
The Nogales specimens all lack the black longitudinal stripe, 
while the others all have it. I do not think this more than 
varietal. Mr. Schaus mentions its presence or absence in his 
description. 

Pseudhapigia brunnea Schaus. 

Four specimens from Mr. Oslar, taken in Nogales and Tucson, 
Arizona. Only two species are known in this genus, and it may 
be that the form before me is new, as it does not tally in all 
respects with the descriptions of brunnea Schaus or xolotl 
Schaus. But 1 have no authentic specimens of these species be 
fore me. In my specimens the color is a warm red-brown. 

Family MEGALOPYGID^. 
Archylus tener Druce. 

Mr. E. J. Oslar has sent me a c? specimen, taken in southern 
Arizona. It is, apparently, referable to the Megalopygidae, 
though the structure is unusual as there is no branch to vein i 
on the fore wings, while veins 7 and 8 of hind wings are united 
to well beyond the end of the cell, arising from a stalk from its 
upper angle. The appearance of the insect is well shown in the 
.rigure in the Biologia Central!- Americana, pi. 79, fig. 6. 

It may remain for the present in the genus Archylus Walker, 
though not agreeing entirely. The type of Archylus is gutti- 
fascia Walker, which, as Sir G. F. Hampson kindly informs 
me, is a Megalopygid much like tener, but vein 8 of the hind 
wings arises just before angle of the cell while the cell is short. 
These differences are probably of generic value, but I will only 
call attention to them now. 



NOTE ON THE LARVA OF AN HAWAIIAN PYRALID. 

( Omiodes accepta Butler) . 
By HARRISON G. DYAR. 

Mr. D. L. Van Dine, of the U. S. Dept. of Agriculture's 
Experiment Station at Honolulu, Hawaiian Islands, has sent me 
larvae of Omiodes accepta, collected from young sugar cane at 
the Niulii Plantation, Kohala, Island of Hawaii. 

Larva, Head rounded, slightly bilobed, green, checkered with angular 
faint luteous spots; a black spot below seta ii, a little oblique dash above 



(]6 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

paraclypeus, eyes and jaws black. Body slender, cylindrical, subequal, 
the segments coarsely 3-annulate. Uniform green, the dorsal vessel edged 
by a more or less distinct opaque white fat body. Tubercles moderate, 
concolorous, iv -f- v normal, on the thorax ia -f- ib, iia -f- iib; setae rather 
large, pale. Feet normal, the crochets in a circle narrowly broken without. 
Cervical shield concolorous, two small black dots at its lateral margin ; a 
blackish line below tubercle iia -j- iib on joint 3. Spiracles concolorous; 
all feet pale. 

Dr. Ash mead exhibited proof sheets and illustrations of his 
forthcoming classification of the Superfamily Chalcidoidea, 
commenting on many of the strange and interesting species 
figured. In reply to a question as to the number of species of 
Chalcid-flies, he stated that he believes that there are between 
3,000,000 and 4,000,000 species of Chalcidoidea in the world. 

Dr. Hinds and Prof. Quaintance were asked to give the Society 
an informal account of the Cotton-boll Weevil (AntJionomus 
grandis} and the Boll-worm, with their experiences and the 
results of their recent investigations on these pests. Dr. Hinds 
gave the life-history of the Cotton-boll Weevil and told of some 
of the measures that are being taken to prevent its spread and 
undue multiplication. Prof. Quaintance spoke further on the 
same subject and also alluded to the present status of the Boll- 
worm (ffeliothis armiger} in Texas and other cotton-growing 
States. Prof. Quaintance said that the record of the largest 
number of eggs laid by a single moth of the Boll-worm had 
been raised, as a result of his observations, from 600 to 2,200. 
Dr. Dyar was asked as to the number of eggs laid by allied 
Noctuidae. He replied that he did not know whether there were 
any records as high as that, but that he knew of an Arctian that 
lays as many as 2,200 eggs. 



FEBRUARY 4, 1904. 

The 1 84th regular meeting was held at the residence of Mr. 
Otto Heidemann, 700 Newark street, N. W. In the absence of 
the President and both Vice-Presidents, .Dr. Howard was elected 
Chairman pro tern., and there were present Messrs. Ash mead, 



OF WASHINGTON. (\1 

Barber, Benton, Burke, Busck, Caudell, Currie, Gill, Heide- 
mann, Hinds, Kotinsky, Morrill, Morris, Patten, Piper, Titus, 
Warner and Webb, members, and Dr. J. R. Sheldon, visitor. 

Under miscellaneous business a vote was taken on the amendr 
ments to Article VII of the Constitution, proposed by the 
Executive Committee at the December meeting. The amend 
ments were adopted and the Article as amended now reads as 
follows : 

SECTION i . The initiation fee of active members shall be one 
dollar ; the annual fee three dollars, payable at each annual 
meeting after election. Any active member in arrears for one 
year may, after one month's notification, be dropped from the 
rolls. No member in arrears shall be entitled to vote. 

SECTION 2. Corresponding members shall pay no initiation 
fee, but shall pay an annual fee of two dollars, payable at 
election and at each annual meeting thereafter. Any corres 
ponding member in arrears for one year may, after notification, 
be dropped from' the rolls. 

SECTION 3. Members elected within three months previous to 
an annual meeting shall not be required to pay an annual fee 
for the year in which they are elected. 

Mr. Kotinsky exhibited an abnormal specimen of Culex 
pipiens. It was received with a collection of Central American 
mosquitoes. The abdomen of the specimen is much distended 
but seems to contain nothing except the ovaries and the eggs. 
Mr. Caudell stated that in Mr. Pergande's notes on mosquitoes 
reared at the Department of Agriculture there are a number of 
references to specimens with similarly inflated abdomen. Mr. 
Kotinsky said that the condition of the abdomen of the mos 
quito was much the same as that of the abdomen of house 
flies that have become affected by fungus growth. Mr. Morris 
said that while he was at Lansing, Michigan, summer before 
last, he was invited by the entomologist there, Mr. R. H. Pettit, 
to examine some fungus-affected mosquitoes. Mr. Pettit, Mr. 
Morris said, is carrying on experiments in the inoculation of 
mosquitoes with fungus diseases. 

Mr. Kotinsky reported the receipt from Prof. CarlF. Baker, 
Claremont, California, of an undetermined insect gall which was 



68 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

found to be infested by the ant Azteca bicolor Emery, by two 
kinds of scale insects a Dactylopius (Pseudococcus) and a 
Lecanium and by another creature which he was unable to 
classify. Mr. Banks, who afterwards examined the latter, re 
ports that it is a larva belonging to the dipterous family Platype- 
zidaB, and looks very similar to the larva of the genus Callomyia. 

Mr. Caudell exhibited an original drawing of a Walking- 
stick that has recently been found in Florida and which is an 
addition to the fauna of the United States. The species is 
ffoploptts evadne, described by Westwood from the West 
Indies. The specimen from which the drawing was made was 
taken on Loggerhead Key. He called attention to the fact that 
the tubercles on the right side of the head are much larger than 
on the left. He also stated that while the females have aborted 
wings the wings of the male are well developed. 

Dr. Howard said that it was interesting to note that Mr. C. 
Schaeffer, during his collecting trip to Brownsville, Texas, last 
June and July, was unable to find a single specimen of the 
Cotton-boll Weevil (Anthonomus grandis Boheman) . In view 
of this, he asked Dr. Morrill, who had visited Brownsville in 
the middle of last November, for a statement as to the preva 
lence of the weevil in that locality. Dr. Morrill then stated 
that in one field examined 75 to 80 per cent, of the cotton 
squares showed work of Anthonomus, and, in another, one or 
two bolls in every stalk showed that weevils had developed 
from them. Dr. Morrill stated that the rainfall at Brownsville 
for the past two years (1901 and 1902) has been less than two- 
thirds of the normal rainfall for that length of time, and this 
would explain why weevils have been less abundant than usual. 

Mr. Heidemann exhibited a small collection of Hemiptera, 
recently received from Costa Rica, and called attention to a 
number of the interesting species represented. 

Mr. Warner said that he had just been pinning a collection 
of Peruvian insects and noted that they were very fragile. 
He did not believe the specimens were insufficiently relaxed but 
thought that their brittleness might be due to the high altitude or 
the dry climate in which they were collected. Mr. Barber then 
remarked that, in his opinion, the brittleness was due rather to 



OF WASHINGTON. . 69 

the manner in which they were collected or the material used in 
killing them. Dr. E. C. Van Dyke had mentioned to him the 
inadvisability of collecting tiger beetles (Cicindelidae) in cyanide 
bottles, as it makes them so brittle that they are easily broken 
when handled, and said that it is much better to kill them in 
alcohol. 

Mr. Currie exhibited a specimen of Bittacus chilensis 
Blanchard, a Neuropteroid insect belonging to the family 
PanorpidcE. This, with one other specimen of the same species, 
is contained in the collection of insects from Chili donated to 
the U. S. National Museum by Mr. E. C. Reed. Mr. Currie 
stated that this is the largest species of the genus Bittacus of 
which he has knowledge, and is of especial interest from the fact 
that, as recorded by McLachlan,* Mr. Reed reported having found 
it in caves, stating that in other situations it was rare. Dr. 
Howard remarked that the specimen exhibited by Mr. Currie is 
very probably the same species as that communicated to Mr. 
McLachlan by Mr. Reed. Mr. Reed spent many years in Chili, 
going first to Valparaiso, then to Santiago ; and finally, owing to 
an attack of the coast fever, he had sought a still higher altitude 
and gone to Banos cle Cauquenes, where the larger part of his 
insect collection was made. Dr. Ashmead said that the Reed 
collection of Chilian insects was a valuable one, and he was glad 
that the Museum had come into the possession of it. 

Mr. Morris mentioned some plans for insect exhibit cases 
that have recently been published in the Journal of Microscopy. 
In the ensuing discussion of the subject of insect exhibit cases 
and insect exhibits Dr. Howard said that, in his opinion, an ex 
hibit of insects should not be exposed constantly to light, on 
account of the rapid deterioration of specimens that always 
results. The most ideal museum, he thought, was that of Dr. 
A. B. Meyer, of Dresden. This is only open for two hours a 
day, from 1 1 o'clock to i o'clock, and at other times curtains 
are drawn so as to exclude the light. Insects should never re 
main exposed to the direct rays of the sun. Dr. Gill said he 
thought that rare species should not be put on exhibition, but 
that an exhibit should be made up of common species and that

these should be so arranged that they can constantly be seen even 
if they do deteriorate from exposure to light. 

Mr. Barber stated that Mr. Warner has been making some 
insect groups for the National Museum exhibit at the St. Louis 
Exposition. One of these groups shows a nest of the common 
yellow jacket ( Vespa germanica ). The nest for this group was 
dug out by Mr. Warner and himself at PJummer's Island, Mary 
land, about the middle of last October. Mr. Warner brought it 
to the Museum and while working on it noticed a large number 
of peculiar small white scales attached to the outside of the nest, 
and called the attention of several persons to them. The opin 
ions vouchsafed as to what they might be were so much at vari 
ance as to be amusing the cocoon of some Microlepidopteron, 
a scale from some plant or grass seed, the anther of some flower, 
the egg of some coleopterous, dipterous or hymenopterous para 
site, etc., etc. Finally, Mr. Banks called his attention to some 
published notes* bearing on this subject. In February, 1861, 
Mr. Walker exhibited before the Entomological Society of 
London " some very small white pupa cases that were found 
attached to wasps' nests. These pupae are finely striated and 
their size is so very minute that they might have been mistaken 
for eggs if Mr. Smith had not discovered the skin of a larva 
inside." Mr. Walker showed also some larvae taken feeding on 
the refuse of hornets' nests which Mr. Westwood considered to 
belong to the dipterous family Anthomyiidae. Mr. Westwood 
stated at a subsequent meeting that the " cocoons" before men 
tioned were eggs of a Syrphus fly (genus Volucella) , well known 
to live in wasps' nests. Still later he exhibited eggs, pupae and 
adults of Vohicella pelluciens Linnaeus from nests of the com 
mon wasp. Mr. Barber stated that in Europe several species of 
Volucella are known to lay their eggs on wasps' nests and to 
live, in the larval state, as scavengers in the nests, feeding on 
dead larvae and pupae and refuse from the wasps. He does not 
know whether the eggs found by Mr. Warner are those of Vo 
lucella or not, but believes that they are. He thinks there are 
no published notes on the occurrence of VoluceJla in wasps' 
nests in America. Mr. Hubbard, however, found another species

OF WASHINGTON. 71 

of the genus ( Vohicella fasciata Macquart) living as a scav 
enger in the prickly pear cactus (Opuntla). To accompany 
his notes Mr. Barber exhibited specimens of the adults of the 
three North American species of Volucella which may be ex 
pected in the vicinity of Washington ( V. evecta Walker, V. 
vcsiculosa Fabricius, and V.fasctata Macquart) and a specimen 
of the European Volucella bombylans Linnaeus one of those 
known to live in wasps' nests. Mr. Barber showed also a num 
ber of the supposed eggs of Volucella taken from the Plummer's 
Island yellow jackets' nest and, for comparison, some specimens 
labeled "eggs of a Syrphid preying upon Pemphigus acerifolii 
Riley. No. io6a, Sept. 20, 'Si." He exhibited, further, some 
alcoholic specimens of dipterous larvae which had later emerged 
from the yellow jackets' nest. These are quite different in ap 
pearance from some first stage larvae taken from the eggs before 
mentioned and might, Mr, Barber thought, be similar to those 
exhibited by Walker, and which Westwood pronounced to be 
Anthomyiid larvae. 

Mr. Benton then read the following paper : 

THE SPECIFIC NAME OF THE COMMON HONEY-BEE. 
BY FRANK BENTON. 

For nearly 150 years the most commonly used specific name 
for our ordinary honey-bee has been mellijica, " honey maker," 
and many hundreds, or I might say, many thousands of books 
and articles have been written in which this term has been used. 
Practical bee-keepers in rather recent times have discussed very 
seriously the question as to whether the honey-bee was a mere 
gatherer and carrier of honey, or did actually make honey ; in 
other words, whether the finished product as it is placed before 
the consumer has been sufficiently changed in the manipulation 
given it by the bees to be accurately described as having been 
made into honey by the bees themselves. 

The use of the specific name mellifera (honey bearer) accent 
uated this discussion somewhat, the question seeming to be, in 
the minds of many bee-keepers unfamiliar with the laws of zoo 
logical nomenclature, merely as to which of the two names 
would be the more appropriate. Incidentally it may be remarked 
that, as a matter of fact, neither name describes fully the office 
of the honey-bee, for the bees certainly do collect and bear the 



72 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

sweets to their hives ; the finished product is very different indeed 
from the raw nectar as it is collected, and this change is due to 
the manipulation given to the material by the bees themselves. 
It consists primarily; in the reduction of the water content from 
60 or 75 per cent, to 18 or 20 per cent, of the whole mass ; and, 
second, in the addition of formic acid as an antiseptic, and possi 
bly also secretions from other glands located in the head of the 
bee. The difference between nectar as gathered from the blos 
soms or floral glands of plants, and thoroughly ripened honey is 
so great that we may safely say the bees make honey from the 
nectar. 

They are, therefore, bearers and makers. But the discussion 
in the apiarian journals as to the relative appropriateness of these 
two names was evidently based on a misconception as to how 
specific names are given. Finally, to set this matter straight, as 
the question seemed to be constantly reappearing, I wrote recently 
for one of the technical apiarian journals,* a popular explana 
tion of the manner in which scientific names are given, and 
quoted the rules of zoological nomenclature applicable to this 
case. 

The name mellijica was published by Linnaeus himself in 
1761, in " Fauna Suecicc" notwithstanding the fact that he 
had previously described the honey-bee under the name melli- 
fera, in 1758, in the tenth edition of his " Systema Naturce" 

These facts were first shown. I believe, by Prof. K. W. von 
Dalla Torre, in Vol. X of his " Catalogus Hymenoplerorum" 
published in 1896; and since, according to Rule XII of the 
Canons of Zoological Nomenclature, " The law of priority be 
gins to be operative at the beginning of zoological nomencla 
ture," and Rule XIII, " Zoological Nomenclature begins at 
1758, the date of the tenth edition of Systema Naturae," the 
earlier name mellrfera must take the precedence, without, of 
course, any reference to its greater or less fitness. Why Linnaeus 
chose to change the name is not apparent. It is possible that, 
considering the vast field covered by him and the great number 
of scientific names which he gave to plants and animals in his 
systematic work, he may have overlooked, in 1761, the fact that 
three years before that time he had named and described the 
honey-bee. Of course he readily recognized that he had the 
same species before him, so it appears more than probable that 
he himself thought the term mellijica (honey maker) would be 
more appropriate than mellifera (honey bearer). At that time 
no law of zoologists interfered with such a change. It was 
merely a question as to whether scientific writers would adopt it 

* Gleanings in Bee Culture, XXXIT, No. 5, March i, 1904. 



OF WASHINGTON. 73 

or not. It seems, however, that the adoption was general, and 
has for the greater part held since that date. Of course all sys- 
tematists will readily see that, as the name mellifera goes back 
to 17^8? no older name can possible replace it, and that Linnaeus' 
name must remain as the authority for this specific name, 
although as a matter of fact a dozen or more writers ( Aldrovandi, 
Moufet, Swammerdam, Reaumur, etc.), had used the name 
mellifera before 17^8. 

In the first and second editions of the work by myself, - pub 
lished by the U. S. Department of Agriculture*, I used the 
specific name mellijica. The third edition of the publication 
cited appeared in 1899. Meanwhile Dalla Torre's " Catalogus" 
had been published, so that, upon looking up the references 
given by him, I adopted the name mellifera. This was, so far 
as I am aware, the first publication of the specific name mellifera 
in a practical manual of apiculture. Prof. A. J. Cook, when 
about to revise his " Guide to Bee Keeping," made an inquiry of 
the U. S. Department of Agriculture as to the reasons for the 
change in the specific name of the common honey-bee in the 
publications of the Department. This matter was referred to 
me and the reasons were given him in full. Thereupon he 
adopted, in the edition of his work which appeared in 1900, the 
specific name mellifera. This, so far as I am aware, is the 
only other work on apiculture which has adopted the name 
mellifera. This information he made later the basis of an ex 
tended article on the subject which was published in the 
" American Bee Journal." f 

The Century Dictionary, Webster's International and the New 
International, have not yet adopted the name mellifera, while 
the Standard Dictionarv gives both mellifera and mellijica, 
with a statement that the latter is still in most general use. 
Systematic workers, however, specialists in this group of the 
Hymenoptera both here and abroad, are quite generally adopting 
the name mellifera in place of mellijica in their publications. 



Dr. Gill said he regretted that the rules of zoological nomen 
clature preclude the retention of mellijica as the name of the 
honey-bee, for he agreed with Mr. Benton that it is a better 
name than mellifera, and he thought Linnreus showed sound 
judgment in substituting it for the latter.

Dr. Ashmead then presented his " Remarks on Philippine 
Hymenoptera." He named some of the collectors who have 
sent Philippine insects to the National Museum, mentioning in 
particular Father W. A. Stanton, who has lately sent in 
especially valuable material in the Hymenoptera. Dr. Ashmead 
mentioned some of the works which contain descriptions of 
Philippine Hvmenoptera. These are very scattered, and the 
occurrence in the Philippines of species found in India and 
southeastern Asia, as well as from islands of the Malay Archi 
pelago, makes the work of naming Philippine insects very 
laborious and difficult. To obviate this he has in preparation a 
list of Philippine Hymenoptera.* Dr. Ashmead then exhibited 
two boxes of Hymenoptera from the Philippines, and called 
attention to a number of species of peculiar interest. He has 
found very few new species in the Aculeata, but among the 
Parasitica there are a large number. For instance, in the 
Proctotrypidae there were formerly no species known from the 
Philippines, but he has found one species among some material 
recently received by the National Museum. In addition to the 
Stanton collections, a number oi valuable specimens have been 
received from Miss Clara S. Ludlow. 

Dr. Howard asked Dr. Ashmead if any of the Chalcid-fiies 
received from the Philippines belong to cosmopolitan species. 
Dr. Ashmead replied that none of them do, but this is probably 
because none of the species sent him have been reared from 
Coccidse. The parasites of Coccidae, as is well known, are 
largely cosmopolitan. Mr. Caudell asked Dr. Ashmead if any 
Hymenoptera are listed in Casto de Elera's catalogue of Philip 
pine insects. Dr. Ashmead replied that there are, but that some 
of the records are inaccurate. Dr. Gill stated that this catalogue 
is very poor, since in many cases it is not a record of species 
actually found in the Philippines, but a list of species which, in 
the author's opinion, should or might be found there, and also 
those of the museum under the author's care. 

Dr. Howard asked Dr. Gill whether the fauna shows that 
there is more than one life-zone in the Philippines. Dr. Gill

replied that it depends a good deal upon what class of animals 
one has reference to. The mammals are decidedly of the 
Oriental type, and many species are shared with Indo-China 
and the East India islands, but in the highlands have been found 
a number of genera (six or more) of muriform rodents peculiar, 
so far as known, to Luzon. There are realty no typical repre 
sentatives of Australian mammals. The numerous birds exhibit, 
on the whole, nearly the same kind of relationship as the 
mammals; their distribution has been well studied by the 
American naturalists Steere, Bourns and Worcester. The last 
relegates the Western Philippines (Palawan and Balabac) to the 
Bornean group of islands. The northern and southern islands have 
few species of Passerines in common, many genera being repre 
sented by analogous species. There is a very slight infusion of the 
Australian fauna. The reptiles and amphibians tell the same 
storv. The species are quite numerous nearly a hundred rep 
tiles and somewhere near thirty amphibians and they are else 
where found, mostly in the neighboring archipelago, but quite a 
number as far west as India. The peculiar species are relatives 
of inhabitants of the same regions. The fresh water fishes are 
of the same character, that is, the same as or relatives of 
inhabitants of Borneo and other islands of the same group and 
India. The terrestrial gastropods tell a different tale. The 
hundreds of species are mostly peculiar to the Philippine archi 
pelago and a very large proportion belong to genera peculiar to 
the islands genera mostly distinguished by a showy hydro- 
phanous shell and whose species are mainly arboreal. Other 
wise the relations of the species and genera are chiefly with 
Indo-Moluccan and Southeastern Asia and India. There is very 
slight manifestation of the influence of the Australian fauna. 
In fine, the universal testimony is to the effect that the fauna of 
the Philippine islands is decidedly related to that of neighboring 
Asia and the islands as well as India. In fact, it belongs to the 
Oriental realm and is very slightly scarcely at all modified by 
Australian elements.

NOTE ON THE LARVA OF THERINA SOMNIARIA HULST. 
By HARRISON G. DYAR. 

This species has been referred as a variety of T. fervidaria 
Hubner, but is really distinct. The characters pointed out by 
Hulst are constant. A series of 46 specimens is before me from 
Mt. Hope, Oregon (F. Epper), and Gray's Harbor, and Satsop, 
Washington (H. E. Burke). Mr. Burke has found the larvae com 
mon on oak (Quercus garryana], which adds another distin 
guishing character between the forms, since the larvae of T. fer 
vidaria are addicted to spruce. I have specimens bred at the De 
partment of Agriculture on spruce (Abies balsamca} from King, 
Maine, under the number 8698. Mr. Burke brought home a num 
ber of the larvae of 7 . somniaria in alcohol. They may be de 
scribed as follows : 

Larva. Shaped and colored as in the other species of Therina and very 
variable. Head wide bilobed, flattish before, clypeus depressed, lobes full, 
wider than high; white with sparse gray spots over the lobes, a black 
spot on tubercles i and ii; sutures, jaws and ocelli dark. Body moderate, 
rather flattened ; light gray, nearly white, smooth. Subdorsal line broad, 
white, narrowly dark edged; venter broadly white. Between these 
marked variably in black. The lightest form has a faint, double, crinkled 
addorsal line, black spots on tubercles i and ii, two black lines represent 
ing the edges of an obsolete lateral line with a black bar below tubercle 
ii between the subdorsal and lateral lines; spiracles black; two fine black 
lines in the subventral area. The dark forms are checkered with black in 
large quadrate patches, forming a smaller checkered pattern on the dorsum 
and large blotches on the sides. 

The pupa is nearly white, thickly spotted with black on the 
abdomen and streaked on the cases. The last segment is entirely 
black : the cremaster has a few stout hooks.

Mr. Schwarz brought home from Cuba some larvae of this 
species in alcohol, and three moths that he had bred. He found 
them toward the end of December on a cultivated plant, Otaheite 
gooseberry ( Cicca disticha), at Cayamas, Cuba. They had de 
foliated the plant and ate large patches of the bark besides. Mr. 
Schwarz fed the larvae that he bred on the bark as there were no 
more leaves left. The three moths lack entirely the usual white 
dashes on the upper sides of the wings, though one shows a trace 
of them below. Gundlach, in Ent. Cubana, records an experi 
ence similar to that of Mr. Schwarz of the larvae eating the bark. 

I^at'va. Head rounded, full, narrowed a little above, slightly bilobed, 
broad; bright red, labrum pale yellow, jaws and ocelli black. Body uni 
form, not elongate, equal, central segments about as long as wide, abdom 
inal feet on joints 10 and 13, the anal pair with triangular plates; all 
feet bright red. Body black, marked with pale yellow; four to six trans 
verse dorsal bars on each segment, the central ones longest, the marginal 
ones shorter and rounded, separated by a subdorsal area of ground color 
from a similar lateral series, the base of which are more confused and 
partly confluent. An even, broad, ventral stripe of pale yellow, somewhat 
transversely barred on the annulets like the dorsal markings. Tubercles 
obscure, concolorous, seta; moderate, black.

I proposed this generic term in 1897 for the Cochlidian species 
argentijlua Geyer and argyrorrhea Hiibner, but gave no exact 
characters. I have now before me two male specimens of argen- 
tiflua from Cayamas (E. A. Schwarz), and Santiago, Cuba 
(Capt. Wirt Robinson), and give from them the generic charac 
ters. In Ent. Cubana, p. 274, Gundlach refers to this species

under the genus Euproctis, though he evidently recognized it 
was not a Liparid but a Cochlidian. He briefly mentions the 
larva as whitish green, furnished with fleshy prolongations. Ob 
viously it resembles the larvae of Alarodia and Isochcetes as 
would be expected. 

$ antennae bipectinated to the tip, the pectinations decreasing out 
wardly; head subprominent, palpi curved, slender, just to the frontal 
tuft; front trigonate, narrowed below, smooth with the erect hairs of tuft 
centrally. Legs long, hairy ; four spurs. Fore wings with costa straight, 
veins 2 and 3 separate, cell with short-forked open discal vein, 7 from 
apex of cell, 8 to 10 stalked; hind wings with 6 and 7 at apex of cell, 8 
anastomosing at base. Form large and robust, otherwise as in Alarodia. 



Mr. Caudell exhibited a living male specimen of the rare 
cockroach Temnopteryx deropeltiformis Brunner. He reared 
this roach from a larva taken last fall at Falls Church, Virginia. 
There are known to him but two other instances of the capture 
of this species east of Indiana a (j> taken by Mr. Jacob Kotinsky 
at Washington, D. C., two years ago, and another ? taken by 
Mr. Nathan Banks at Falls Church, Virginia, one year later. 
Wasmann* records this as a myrmecophilous insect, his record 
being based on specimens sent him by Mr. T. Pergande and col 
lected under stones at Cabin John Bridge, Maryland. Not long ago 
Mr. Caudell visited this locality with Mr. Pergande and under 
stones in exactly similar situations found specimens which Mr. 
Pergande pronounced the same as those sent to Wasmann. These 
were nymphs and, on maturing, proved to be Ischnoptera uhler- 
iana Saussure. Mr. Caudell stated that he had no doubt that 
the specimens sent Wasmann are this species and not Temnop 
teryx. The specimens of T. deropeltiformis were taken in 
decaying wood, and Mr. Caudell said he did not believe that 
Temnopteryx had been found in ants' nests. He added that 
there are, in the National Museum, specimens of this species 
from Texas. 

Mr. Caudell mentioned, also, another cockroach new to the 
vicinity of Washington Ischnoptera intricata, recently de-

Mr. Currie exhibited a handsome and peculiarly marked lace-

representing a new species. It was collected by Mr. H. S. Bar 
ber at Little River, Humboldt county, California, on the 3ist of

During the spring and summer of 1903, Mr. H. S. Barber 
visited the western part of Humboldt county, California, in the 
interest of the U. S. Department of Agriculture, to investigate 
forest insects and make collections. En route he spent a couple 
of days at the Grand Canyon of the Colorado river at Bright 
Angel, where he collected a number of insects. Although not 
looking especially for Hemerobiids he nevertheless secured a few 
species five in all from Arizona and California and two of the 
California ones appear to be new to science. None of the three 
species obtained at Bright Angel are new to Arizona but are in

HEMEROBIID^E FROM THE KOOTENAY DISTRICT OF 
BRITISH COLUMBIA. 

By ROLLA P. CURRIE. 

The Hemerobiid lace-winged flies collected in British Colum 
bia last summer by Dr. H. G. Dyar, Mr. A. N. Caudell and 
myself comprised twelve species, represented by eighty-six 



82 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

specimens. Of the various species obtained, Polystocchotes 
punctatus, Hcmerobius pacificus, H. disjunctus and Micromus 
montanus appear to be the commonest species, with Hemerobius 
mcestus, perhaps, coming next in abundance. The finding of 
Hemerobius castanece and Sisyra vicar ia is of interest. It is 
rather unfortunate that each of the five new species described in 
this paper is represented by a single specimen only ; yet the 
characters they exhibit appear to differentiate them well from the 
species previously recognized. 

I am indebted to Mr. Nathan Banks for the loan of his collec 
tion to aid in determining our material, and for helpful sugges 
tions. 

The four genera represented in the collection may be distin 
guished by the key given in Needham's "Aquatic Insects in the 
Adirondacks." *

u Lilypad Lake," Kaslo, 8 July. Two specimens of this in 
teresting little Hemerobiid, whose larvas are known to live para- 
sitically on fresh water sponges, were secured on the borders of 
a small marshy pond in the forest. This is the first record of the 
capture of Sisyra in Western North America. It seems possi 
ble that the related genus Climacia, the larvae of which, as dis 
covered by Needham, have similar habits, may also some day be 
found in the West. 

These specimens appear to differ somewhat from examples in 
the National Museum labeled vicaria^ yet do not in all respects 
agree with Needham's description of umbrata^\ the only other 
described North American species. It does not yet appear cer 
tain that Needham's and Walker's species are distinct, and a good 
series of vicaria from Georgia, the type locality, may be neces 
sary to definitely settle the question. These things considered, I 
prefer not to describe the two specimens from British Columbia, 
perhaps more or less teneral, as representing a new species.

are that these two forms are distinct species.

Hemerobius dyari, n. sp. 

Alar expanse 13 mm. Body above and below, including legs and 
antennae, pale yellowish, the latter darker toward tip. Face indistinctly 
bordered with darker and with an indistinct line around antennal sockets, 
piceous below each eye and on lateral margins and middle of clypeus ; 
apical joint of palpi piceous. Pronotum dark each side, leaving a longi 
tudinal median pale stripe. Anterior wings rather narrow their width 
scarcely more than one-third their length their tips rather narrowly 
rounded; basal half of costal area rather narrow; costa flattened almost 
concave in the middle, strongly convex above the large pale pterostigma; 
smoky hyaline, with pale spots along the longitudinal veins; veins pale, 
with indistinct brownish spots most pronounced along the radial sectors 
from inner to outer gradate series; hind margin of wing, from middle to 
apex, brownish, interrupted with pale spots and with a brownish spot near 
base ; radius spotted with dark brown from near base to pterostigma ; 
cubitus, also, spotted with dark brown, some of the spots larger than 
those on the radius, the largest one covering the basal veinlet connecting 
with the posterior fork of the median, and another large one midway be 
tween this and the apical connecting veinlet; a large, paler brown spot on 
the median above the apical connecting veinlet; posterior fork of median 
bent toward cubitus, thus making the inner veinlet connecting it with cu 
bitus shorter than the outer; radio-median cross vein situated at least as 
far before forking of median as the former is long and joining radius 
much before origin of first sector; forking of median plainly before origin 
of first sector; three radial sectors, anterior branch of the third forked be 
fore inner gradate series (and before subpterostigmal radial cross vein in 
right wing of type specimen, at this vein in left wing), posterior branch 
simple; five gradate veins in inner series, the last (hindmost) slightly be

to H. pacificus. It differs from the latter in being of smaller 
size, and in having narrower and differently shaped wings, larger 
and more distinct pterostigma and larger spots along radius and 
cubitus. 

Hemerobius kokaneeanus, n. sp. 

Alar expanse 14 mm. Body above and below obscure fuscous or pice- 
ous; the basal half of antennae, posterior lateral angles of pronotum, a 
small spot in center of mesonotum, and the legs mostly, pale. Anterior 
wings rather narrow their width less than two-fifths of their length 
their tips narrowly rounded, hind margin flattened apically, the basal half 
of costal area very narrow; hyaline, tinged with smoky and marked with 
fuscous ; veins pale, with scattered brown spots principally where crossed 
by the wing markings; these wing markings comprise an irregular, more 
or less interrupted band on each gradate series, a large spot on subptero- 
stigmal radial cross vein, some spots at fork of median and along cubitus, 
hind margin (with the exception of a few pale interruptions), and series 
of smaller spots on the longitudinal veins between radius and hind mar 
gin; pterostigma indistinct; a pale longitudinal line bisects costal space 
through the bases of intercostal forks ; posterior fork of median strongly 
bent toward cubitus, making the inner veinlet connecting with cubitus 
much shorter than the outer; radio-median cross vein situated at least as 
far before the forking of median as the former is long, and joining radius 
much before origin of first sector; forking of median plainly before origin 
of first sector; three radial sectors, anterior branch of the third forked as 
far out as, or beyond, inner gradate series (as far out as inner series in 
left wing, and beyond inner series in right wing, in the type specimen) 
and beyond subpterostigmal radial cross vein, posterior branch simple; 
five gradate veins in inner series, the last before the next to the last, six 
or seven in outer series (six in right wing, seven in left, in the type speci 
men). Posterior wings hyaline, with a faint smoky tinge, most of the 
veins dark, the longitudinals pale at base ; first fork of radial sector plainly 
before forking of median. 

Kokanee Mountain, altitude 9,000 feet, 10 August, collected 
upon snow on glacier : one specimen. 

Type. No. 7897, U. S. National Museum. 

The venation of this species seems to place it with H. pacifi 
cus, H. castanece and H. dyari, except that in these latter three 
the anterior branch of the third radial sector is forked before the 
inner gradate series and subpterostigmal radial cross vein, while 
in H. kokaneeanus it is forked as far out as, or beyond, inner 
gradate series and beyond the subpterostigmal radial cross vein. 
The wholly dark thorax and the darker and more closely approxi 
mated wing markings, however, readily distinguish it from any 
of the species just mentioned.

Hemerobius caudelli, n. sp. 

Alar expanse 13.2 mm. Body above and below obscure fuscous or pice- 
ous ; the basal half, or more, of antennae, the vertex, hind portion of pro- 
notum medially and its posterior lateral angles, meso- and metanotum 
medially, and the legs, pale. Anterior wings rather broad their width 
two-fifths of their length their tips and hind margin rounded, basal half 
of costal area rather broad; hyaline, marked with dark and pale fuscous; 
veins pale, with fuscous interruptions principally where crossed by the 
wing markings ; these wing markings consist of an irregular, more or less 
interrupted band on each gradate series, numerous shorter, irregular, 
transverse spots or bands between them and before them to near base of 
the wing, numerous short, nearly confluent, transverse spots at apex and 
hind margin, and series of transverse pale fuscous spots in costal and anal 
areas; a pale longitudinal line bisects costal space through bases of inter 
costal forks ; pterostigma indistinct, creamy whitish ; posterior fork of 
median somewhat bent toward cubitus, making the inner veinlet connect 
ing with cubitus a little shorter than the outer (no inner connecting vein- 
let in left wing of type); radio-median cross vein situated a little before 
forking of median and joining radius at, or a little before, origin of first 
sector (a little before first sector in right wing, at first sector in left wing, 
in the type specimen) ; forking of median almost directly beneath origin 
of first sector; three radial sectors, anterior branch of the third forked as 
far out as, or beyond, inner gradate series and subpterostigmal radial 
cross vein (at these in left wing, beyond these in right wing, in the type 
specimen), posterior branch simple; four or five gradate veins in inner 
series (four in right wing, five in left, in the type), the last beyond the 
next to the last, five or six in outer series (five in right wing, six in left, 
in the type). Posterior wings hyaline, faintly tinged with smoky on 
gradate veins and elsewhere; veins mostly dark, the longitudinals pale at 
base; first fork of radial sector plainly before forking of median. 

London Hill Mine, Bear Lake, altitude 7,000 feet, 29 July, 
collected upon snow ; one specimen. 

Type. No. 7898, U. S. National Museum. 

This species bears some resemblance to H. kokaneeanus, but 
differs from it in the position of the radio-median cross vein and 
in the relative position of the forking of the median vein and ori 
gin of first radial sector ; it differs, also, in that the vertex and 
the meso- and metanotum are largely pale, the wings broader and 
more rounded and their markings larger and more extended, 
while the last veinlet of inner gradate series is beyond the next to 
the last. It belongs in Banks' Group II, Section A, as do all the 
other species of Hemerobius in the collection, with the exception 
of H. disjunctus.

and metanotum, and the legs principally, pale. Anterior wings rather 
broad their width two-fifths of their length their tips? (torn off), 
basal half of costal area rather broad; hyaline, tinged with smoky and

where crossed by the wing markings; these wing markings consist of an 
irregular, more or less interrupted band on each gradate series, numerous 
short, irregular spots (sometimes tending to form bands) along the longi 
tudinal veins, some larger spots at forking of median and along cubitus, a 
large spot on subpterostigmal radial cross vein, and some transverse 
spots in costal area, these spots pale in basal portion; apex and hind 
margin of wing tinged with smoky; pterostigma indistinct; a longitudi 
nal pale line bisects costal area at bases of intercostal forks ; posterior 
fork of median bent toward cubitus, making the inner veinlet connecting 
with cubitus shorter than the outer; radio-median cross vein situated at 
the base of fork of median and joining radius at origin of first sector;

Kokanee Mountain, altitude 9,000 feet, 10 August, collected 
upon snow on glacier ; one specimen. 

Type. No. 7899, U. S. National Museum. 

This Hemerobiid bears some resemblance to H. kokanceanus 
and If. caudelli. It seems to be more closely related to the lat 
ter, however, since it substantially agrees with that species in the 
position of the radio-median cross vein and the relative position 
of the forking of median vein and origin of first radial sector ; like 
that species, also, it is pale on the vertex and on the meso- and 
metanotum. It differs from H. caudelli in that the last gradate 
vein of inner series is before the next to the last, while the ante 
rior branch of third radial sector is forked before 4 the inner gradate 
series and subpterostigmal radial cross vein ; the wing markings, 
also, are smaller and less extended.

This diminutive Hemerobius is allied, by venation, to H. cau-

pearance suggest//", canadensis Banks, but the latter is described 
as having the " cubitus [median] not curving toward the postcu-

talis tenax}. It is well-known that these Syrphid flies have a 
habit of visiting chrysanthemums to feed upon the pollen, and 
this fly has been credited with effecting, to a greater or less de 
gree, the fertilization of these blossoms. The plan of introduc 
ing it into countries where chrysanthemums do not seed has been 
seriously discussed. Drone flies have frequently been mistaken 
for bees. At the famous Utter trialf Mr. Benton, who was a 
witness for the National Bee-Keepers' Association, brought with 
him a small case of insects containing workers, queens and drones 
of Apis mcllifcra and a number of drone flies. This case, when 
passed around, revealed the fact that the prosecution were unable 
to distinguish drone flies from bees with certainty, and therefore 
unable to prove positively that bees were the cause of the alleged 
damage. Even some of the skilled bee-keepers, to whom the

Mr. Oslar sent me a pair which he took in the Patagonia 
Mountains, Arizona. The male agrees with the description in 
the Biologia Centrali-Americana, but is rather smaller than the 
figure. The female has more white spots than the male. The 
form comes extremely close to palmerii Edw., which I at first 
thought it to be, till Mr. Oslar called my attention to the differ

blackish brown and white. The ground is ochraceous, appearing irregu 
larly at base, in the elongate orbicular, in the t.-p. line opposite the cell 
and at apex, elsewhere obscured by dark red brown shades. Lines black 
ish, clouded, t.-a. outwardly oblique, t.-p. bent over cell with minute light 
points on the veins. Reniform ringed in white, showing a distinct spot 
at the outer side of the constriction ; clavifonn black outlined, obscured 
in a blackish shade which irregularly fills the median space. Subterminal 
line pale, waved, obscure, terminal space shaded in black and running in

The species is near pluviosa, distinguished therefrom by the 
smoother colors and the restriction of the white marking of the 
reniform. The two specimens from Mr. Cockerell are nearly 
black; two from Mr. Bruce are more brownish, possibly due to 
the specimens being older ; the third specimen from Mr. Bruce 
is reddish brown. The three specimens from Mr. Bruce have 
been in the National Museum collection ever since Dr. J. B. 
Smith arranged it, the brown ones under the label pluviosa 
Walker, the red one under lateritia Hiibner.

Tracheops bolteri Hulst. 

I have received this species from Las Vegas (C. P. Gillette) 
and Mesilla Park, New Mexico (T. D. A. Cockerell), the speci 
mens being, respectively, a 9 and a d\ Hulst described the form 
from a single cf from Mr. Bolter's collection and, in placing the 
genus in his synopsis, he made some of his characteristic as 
sumptions, viz, that the female had simple antennae and no fovea 
on fore wings below, when he had never seen a female. In this 
case he is proven to have been right. I do not detect the fovea 
and the antennae are not pectinated, yet they are peculiar in that 
they are strongly serrate on the central part of the shaft. In col 
oration the 9 resembles the d\ but the hind wings have more 
pronounced markings, forming a rather definite scalloped mesial 
line. Fresh specimens are obviously pale olivaceous green, as 
this color is largely present in the 9 specimen, though lost in the

This species may be referable to the genus Sesia, as the char

A specimen was sent to the late Dr. Hulst several years ago and 
was determined by him as " Salebria nubiferella Rag. (??)." 
The specimen was not in good condition, being an undersized 
female, somewhat rubbed, so that the determination was not 
made at the best advantage. The species is not referable to Sale 
bria on account of the venation ; but, even so, it does not agree 
with the description of any of the species of that genus. In 
Ragonot's figure of mibiferella, the base is not red, and the 
course of the inner line is interrupted and different from the speci 
mens before me.

think the section of Nephopteryx, with veins 4 and 5 of fore 
wings actually stalked (not approximate only), may properly be 
recognized as of generic value, under the name Tacoma. It

The larva was black, five-eighths of an inch long, the head yellow, 
retractile; thinly covered with short white hairs. The leaf was 
folded lengthwise and upwards, the edges tightly fastened to 
gether, giving the fold a very sharp edge, the entire leaf looking 
like a pod. Within the fold there is a web which holds the ex 
crement suspended." (Chambliss.)

The type of this genus, constantella Hulst, is obviously syn 
onymous with Getulia flavidorsella Rag. Ragonot defined 
Getulia from an African species, a 9 only, and later referred to 
it his flavidorsella, first described under Anoristia from 9 9 
only. Whether the African species has the same $ characters 
as the American one is purely a matter of surmise at present and 
I therefore retain Hulst's generic term and remove Getulia from 
the North American list.

A NEW COCCINELLID ENEMY OF THE SAN JOSE SCALE. 
By E. A. SCHWARZ. 

Mr. C. L. Marlatt who lately visited Southern California found 
a small Coccinellid quite abundant on fruit trees infested by the 
San Jose Scale (Aspidiotus perniciosus], and reports that it is 
well known among the orchardists of Southern California as an 
efficient enemy of that Coccid. From a study of specimens sub 
mitted to me by Mr. Marlatt I find that they belong to the genus 
Pseudoweisea Cockerell. These minute Coccinellids, originally 
described by Dr. LeConte as Pentilia and subsequently referred 
by J. Weise to his genus Smilia (the name changed to Epismilia 
and finally to Pseudoweisea by Prof. Cockerell), all prey exclu 
sively upon Diaspinas. In former years they were quite rare in 
collections, but since economic entomologists have paid attention 
to the enemies of imported Coccids, it was found that they are 
in reality quite abundant. 

Pseudoweisea suturalis, n. sp. 

Rounded oval, convex; head and thorax nearly opaque, elytra shining. 
Head, thorax, underside and legs black; elytra brownish red with the 
suture narrowly black. Head but little wider than long, with the upper 
surface flattened. Prothorax forming a distinct obtuse with the elytra, 
oblique line at anterior angles distinct but not prolonged along the lateral 
margin, basal marginal line distinct at the sides but very fine at the mid 
dle, upper surface finely alutaceous and with sparse shallow larger punc 
tures. Elytra not alutaceous, rather strongly but not densely punctured, 
sutural stria distinct throughout, but very fine near the base. The black 
color is usually confined to the narrow space between the suture and the 
sutural striae. Length o.S to 0.9 mm. 

Type. No. 7936, U. S. National Museum. 

The National Museum has numerous specimens found by Mr. 
F. Maskew at Long Beach, Los Angeles Co.. Cal., feeding on 
Aspidiotus perniciosus ; and a long series of specimens bred by 
Mr. D. W. Coquillett from larva? feeding on Aspidiotus aurantii 
at Los Angeles, Cal. 

The species resembles in form of the body the eastern P. mi- 
sell a ^ but its head is narrower and the coloration different. 
More or less immature, or bred specimens have the sterna (ex 
cepting the metepisterna), and the abdomen brownish or reddish. 

It may be that Mr. H. C. Fall's remarks on the occurrence of 
P. (Smilia} ovalis Lee.,* refer to P. suturalis. The former 
seems to be confined to the more southern parts of Florida and is 
readily known from the more elongate form of the body.

Mr. Coquillett has kindly placed at my disposal a copy of his 
field notes (written in 1892) referring to the larva and pupa of 
this species. These notes read as follows : 

" No. 344. Larva resembles fig. 364, page 432, of Packard's ' Guide to 
the Study of Insects.' 

" Body 12 segmented, olive-brown in the younger ones, becoming salmon- 
brown in the older ones; head black, horizontal, depressed, about one- 
half longer than wide, one-half as Avide as the first thoracic segment; the 
latter is longer than any of the other body segments and is marked with 
two black dorsal spots placed transversely; body widest at the third ab 
dominal segment, last segment rounded behind, devoid of processes, fur 
nished with a retractile proleg ; body sparsely clothed with microscopic 
hairs each tipped with a minute translucent globule, mostly white but 
sometimes tinged with yellow; the six thoracic legs black; length 
1.50 mm. 

" Found several at Los Angeles, Cal. , February 12, 1892, on orange trees 
infested with Aspidiotus anrantii and red spiders upon both of which they 
appeared to feed. In pupating the larval skin is worked back until the 
middle of the dorsum of the first five abdominal segments are exposed to 
view, but the sides of the fourth and fifth segments and the ends of the 
wing cases remain concealed by the old larval skin. 

" The pupa varies in color from pale yellow to deep orange-yellow, with 
the first thoracic segment dark brown and marked with a whitish medio- 
dorsal line; the pupa is covered with short hairs most abundant at the 
front end and sides, and each tipped with a minute translucent globule. 
Length 1.25 mm. 

" Two larvge pupated March ist, but the date of the issuing of the adults 
was not noted." 

Mr. Schwarz, in this connection, stated that in the North 
American fauna there are comparatively few Coccinellida} that 
feed upon the armored scales (Diaspinas). Beside the genus Chi- 
locorus and allied genera he knew only a few isolated genera of 
other sub-families which have this habit. These are (i) the 
various species of Pscudoweisea; (2) the two species of Cephal- 
oscymnus, our eastern species, which feeds upon the maple scale 
(Aspidiotus furfurus}, and the western species which has been 
observed in Arizona preying upon an Aspidiotus on oak ; (3) the 
species of Nipus, our smallest Coccinellidas, representing the sub 
family Cranophorinae, which* appear, however, to be too rare to 
have any economic importance ; (4) the species of the genus 
Scymnillus. 

In reply to a question by Prof. Piper, Mr. Schwarz stated that, so 
far as has been observed, all Coccinellids that feed upon soft-bodied 
scales and aphids feed also upon " red spiders" (Tetranychzis).

Dr. Ashmead presented the following paper : 

REMARKS ON HONEY BEES. 
By WILLIAM H. ASHMEAD. 

Hive bees, or the genuine honey bees, are of great economic 
importance in all countries, not only as adding to the wealth of 
the people but as pollenizers of various plants and fruit trees. 
Their study, therefore, is always interesting, and something new 
may be discovered either biologically or morphologically. 

A number of exotic honey bees having accumulated in the 
National Museum, I became greatly interested in their study and 
in naming the various species represented. Thinking the results of 
this study would prove of interest to some of our members I shall 
to-night give briefly some of these results, and shall exhibit most 
of the various species now represented in the National collection. 
The species exhibited are, as you will see from the labels, from 
various countries : Europe, Africa, the East Indies, Japan, China, 
Malay Archipelago, the Philippines, etc. 

You are all doubtless aware that authorities differ greatly respect 
ing the number of species of honey bees found in the world. 
Some think there is but a single species and treat others as mere 
varieties ; others that there are two or three species ; while still 
others would have nine, ten or a dozen species. Our material is 
yet too limited for me to form any decided opinion, or to settle 
the vexed question respecting the number of species, or the vari 
ous problems connected with the numerous varieties, originating 
from cross-fertilization and various climatic causes ; but so far as 
my studies have gone I have reached almost the same opinion as 
that given by Mr. Frederick Smith, of the British Museum, many 
years ago, and published in the Annals and Magazine of Natural 
History for 1865. 

The old genus Apis should, I think, be divided into two genera, 
representing the two sections first defined by Smith, as follows: 

Eyes somewhat convergent above so that the vertex is narrowed, the 
lateral ocelli being farther from each other than to the eye margin ; 
second recurrent nervure received by the third cubital cell very near 

its apex Megnpis, n. gen. 

(Type : Apis dor sat a Fabr.) 

Eyes not convergent above, the vertex not narrowed, the lateral ocelli 
not farther from each other than to the eye margin ; second recur 
rent nervure received by the third cubital cell some distance from 

its apex Apis Linne.

Genus MEGAPIS Ashmead. 
Onlv two species fall in this genus, 
(i.) Megapis zonata Smith. 

Apis zonata Smith. 

Hab. Philippine Islands, Celebes. 

This species is treated by Gerstaecker as a variety of Apis dor- 
sata Fabr., but I consider it quite distinct. I exhibit a single g 
taken by Dr. P. L. Stangl, at Bacoor, Philippine Islands. 

(2.) Megapis dorsata Fabricius. 
Apis dorsata Fabr. 
a. var. bicolor King, 
aa. var. testacea Smith. 

Hab. India, Java, Ceylon, Borneo, Malay Archipelago, Philip 
pines. 

Evidently a common species in some places. Dr. W. L. Ab 
bott has sent the National Museum many specimens from the 
Straits Settlement. 

Genus APIS Linne. 

(i.) Apis mellifera Linne. 
(Typical form black.) 

a. var. ligustica Latr. 
aa. var. fasciata Latr. 

Hab. All parts of the world (introduced). 
(2.) Apis cerana Fabricius. 

Apis sinensis Smith, $. 
Apisjaponica Radoszkowsky, ^. 

Hab. Japan and China. 

I show specimens of 9, and $ from Japan and China. The 
species is apparently common in Japan. It shows some affinity 
with Apis mellifera, but is quite distinct as may be seen bv com 
paring the different sexes with mellifera exhibited together in 
the box. 

(3.) Apis indica Fabricius. 

Hab. India. 
(4.) Apis nigrocincta Smith. 

Hab. India, China, Malay Peninsula, and the Philippines. 

A common species variable in the color of the abdomen. 

(5.) Apis nigritarum Lepeletier. 

Apis adansonii Latr. 

Hab. Africa. 

A smaller species than nigrocincta and indica. 



122 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

(6.) Apis unicolor Latreille. 

Hab. Madagascar. 

It is also recorded from the Philippines, but probably erro 
neously. 

(7.) Apis florea Fabricius. 

Hab. India. 

This is probably the smallest honey bee known, and presents 
certain structural characters that will exclude it from the genus 
Apis Linne, as now restricted. In some of its characters it 
shows some affinities that ally it to the large honey bees Mcgapis. 
I propose to place it in a genus by itself under the name Micrapis. 
The lateral ocelli are farther from each other than to the eye 
margin, the venation nearly as in Apis Linne, while the basal joint 
of the hind tarsi in the male is incisely lobed. 



Dr. Ashmead stated his belief that the honey bees were 
originally in the wild state black, unbanded, and that the yel 
low-banded races of Apis mellifera are a product of domestica 
tion and artificial selection. In discussing Dr. Ashmead's com 
munication, Mr. Benton said he differed decidedly from the 
former when he stated that all wild bees belong to the black type. 
He cited the various races of mellifera which are found in east 
ern Mediterranean countries and have undoubtedly been wild for 
thousands of years, their yellow color being in no sense a result 
of domestication. A. dorsata and A. florca are both yellow- 
banded bees, yet have never been cultivated ; and itidica, which 
is quite highly colored in some portions of India, is cultivated to 
a very limited extent only. He referred to the mention of yellow 
bees in Virgil's 4th Georgic, and expressed the belief that the 
Italian race of honey bees was the result of contact between bees 
probably brought by early Phoenician settlers to southern Italy 
and the black bees of the country. He stated his belief that there 
have probably always been two distinct types of wild bees occu 
pying distinct regions. 

Mr. Benton said further that Apis dorsata has been known in 
literature as the Giant Bee of India ; he thought it should not be 
called the Common Bee of India the term applied to it by Dr. 
Ashmead since that designation belongs to Apis indica, a more 
abundant and more widely distributed species than dorsata. 



OF WASHINGTON. 123 

Dr. Howard asked Mr. Benton if he could tell what was the 
species of bee mentioned in Kipling's Jungle Book as chasing the 
"red dholes" or hairy-toed dogs of the Deccan. Mr. Benton 
replied that it was undoubtedly dorsata, a species known for its 
fierceness and persistence in pursuing intruders when thoroughly 
aroused. Dr. Howard then asked Mr. Benton whether the life- 
history of the honey bee as portrayed in Maeterlinck's " Life of 
the Bee," is scientifically accurate, to which Mr. Benton replied 
that it is so, except, perhaps, in some minor particulars which he 
did not then recollect.

Mr. Schwarz called attention to the desirability of a more 
thorough exploration of the isolated mountain ranges in southern 
Arizona. From the little that is known of these regions it is safe 
to say that a great many species will be found there that do not 
occur in the corresponding zones of the plateau region of northern 
Arizona, where the fauna is very little different from that of other 
parts of the Rocky Mountains. Mr. Busck, on being questioned 
as to the feeding habits of this genus, replied that nothing is 
known concerning their habits, but that the larva? of the genera 
most nearly allied to them spin webs and feed within them. Dr. 
Dyar said that, in his opinion, the structure of the palpi in the 
genus Dorata shows that this genus is not closely allied to the 
genera whose feeding habits Mr. Busck mentioned, and that, 
therefore, it would be unsafe to draw conclusions as to the feed 
ing habits.

Mr. Caudell presented for publication the following paper : 
THE SYNONYMY OF CEDIPODA CINCTA THOMAS. 
By A. N. CAUDELL. 

In 1870,* Thomas described his CEdipoda cincta, and a curious 
condition has followed, for we now have two species based on 
that one description Mcstobregma cinctum and Trimcrotropis 
ciucta. It is obvious that one must be changed, as two specific 
names cannot properly be based on one description. 

Six years after making the original description Thomas re 
ferred his species with doubt to the genus Mestobregma^ and 
four years later treated of it under that genus J But at that time the 
genera were not clearly defined and the characters used by Thomas 
as of generic value were inadequate for the separation of the two in 
sects under discussion. In 1884, Saussure located Thomas' species, 
from his description, in the genus Trimerotropis\ A careful 
study of Thomas' descriptions shows that they apply much better 
to a species of Trimerotropis than to a member of the genus 
Mestobregma. While many of the characters given apply 
equally well to either, certain ones apply only to Trimerotropis. 
Such are the following: Disk of the posterior lobe of the pro- 
notum nearly flat and with the posterior angle greater than a right 
angle ; median carina of the thorax only a raised line ; posterior 
femora not reaching the tip of the abdomen in the female. No 
character mentioned in the description is inapplicable to a mem 
ber of the genus Trimerotropis, and the type mentioned by 
McNeillH belongs to that genus. Taken all together, it seems 
well to consider Trimerotropis cincta to be the species eligibly 
based on Thomas' original description. This being accepted, it 
leaves the insect now known as Mestobregma cinctum to be 
dealt with. As a new specific name seems inevitable, I propose 
the name thomasi. The synonymy of the two species will thus 
stand as follows : 

1. Trimerotropis cincta Thomas. 

CEdipodd cincta Thomas. 

Mestobregma cinctum Thomas (not Bruner, Scudder, etc.). 

2. Mestobregma thomasi Caudell. 

Mestobregma cinctum Bruner, Scudder, etc. (not Thomas).

ON THE SPECIES OF SPHENOPHORUS HITHERTO CON 
SIDERED AS SIMPLEX LECONTE.* 

By F. H. CHITTENDEN. 

Since the publication of Sphenophorus simplex by LeContef 
there has been discovered, and is present in most large collec 
tions, a series of a considerably larger species which at first 
glance, with exception of an occasional abnormal individual, can 
readily be separated from the true simplex which was described 
from San Juan and Fort Yuma, California. The size of the ser 
ies of simplex which Dr. Horn had at hand when he reviewed 
the genus Sphenophorus in 1873,! was less than a third of an 
inch. The other species which the writer has mentioned fre 
quently measures half an inch and sometimes a little more. It is 
true that this second species, to which I propose to give the name 
of mormon, since it is found chiefly in Utah, is very closely re 
lated to simplex, as evidenced by the similarity of the sexes, and 
it is evident also that they had a common ancestor, or one may 
possibly be an offshoot of the other. During July, 1903, Mr. H. 
F. Wickham captured still a third form belonging to this group,

and presented the National Museum with a good series. The 
study of a very large series shows that although a few individ 
uals of simplex, chiefly from Utah, approach in some few charac 
ters a tendency to merge into mormon from the same State, 
nevertheless they can be separated by characters which will be 
furnished in 'the accompanying table. The latter species is not 
known and may not occur in California, and it is much less vari 
able than is the true simplex. The third species, which I have 
named distichlidis, is apparently known only from the vicinity of 
Amedee. California. Some of the characters, and particularly 
those of the sexes furnished in the description of mormon, have 
not previously been noted in this group to my knowledge. The 
following synopsis is furnished : 

Rostrum without carinae, or, if present, feebly indicated and short. 
Scutellum variable, feebly broadly concave. 

Elytra subopaque, thorax normally shining ; discal stria; nar 
row and shallow and less distinctly punctate; sutural striae 
quite or nearly straight ; intervals alternately very minutely 
uni- and bi-seriately punctulate. Anterior tibiae seldom ser 
rate inside. Pvgidium normally with distinct lateral apical 
tufts of hairs, of 9 distinctly bilaterally concave. 

simplex LeConte 

Rostrum strongly carinate at middle and at sides, carinae long. 
Scutellum somewhat variable, channeled at middle.

deep and distinctly punctate; sutural strite outwardly curved 
at base; intervals distinctly punctulate with two or three 
rows. Anterior tibiae and sometimes all distinctly serrate in 
side. Pygidium without tufts of hair; of 9 not bilaterally 
concave or feebly so. 

First and second abdominal segments 9 distinctly separate. 

mormon, n. sp. 

Elytra and thorax subopaque; discal striae moderately wide, 
deep and punctate ; sutural curved ; intervals 1,2,3 and 5 bi- 
or tri-seriately punctulate. Anterior tibiae seldom serrate in

face without coating of any kind. General color polished jet black, or 
with the elytra piceous and the entire dorsal surface more or less polished. 
Legs black or dark piceous. 

Rostrum three-fifths as long as the thorax, moderately arcuate, mode 
rately nearly uniformly compressed, more narrowly at the apex, strongly

carinate on anterior margin and at the sides, the carinas extending from 
the dilated portion of the base to near the apex ; base moderately wide, 
suddenly dilated over the scrobes, feebly or not canaliculate, interocular 
fossa distinct, large and shallow, from which a fine impressed line leads 
to the median carina; anterior face of apex convex; surface nearly uni 
formly finely and densely punctate. Head finely sparsely punctulate. 

Thorax moderately convex, about one-fourth longer than wide, basal 
half subparallel, apical half moderately arcuately narrower to apex, which 
is rather strongly constricted; surface moderately deeply, finely, and 
somewhat sparsely punctate, punctures larger and sparse in front of scu- 
tellum, finer and dense along the basal margin. Scutellum channeled at 
middle. 

Elytra one-fifth wider than thorax, gradually narrower toward apex ; 
striae punctate throughout their length, first stria strongly curved at sides 
of scutellum, feebly punctate at base, the others gradually more distinctly 
to the sides. Intervals flat, subequal in width, variable in punctuation, 
the first and second and sometimes the third and fourth tri-seriately punc 
tulate, the others irregularly with punctulation in one, two or three rows. 
Pygidium moderately coarsely and densely punctate, punctures naked or 
bearing minute yellow hairs, without apical tufts. 

Lower surface finely, rather densely punctate, feebly on prosternum 
and middle of abdominal segments, sparsely in the middle of the meta- 
stsrnum, densely in the apical region of the last segment. 

Male. Metasternum broadly and moderately concave, first abdominal 
and a portion of the second segment broadly feebly concave: tibiae angu- 
late and strongly fimbriate with long yellow hairs on the inner surface 
beyond the angle, the posterior pair very strongly angulated ; pygidium 
subtruncate with rounded sides. 

Female. Metasternum feebly concave, abdominal segments convex; 
posterior tibiae not strongly angulated, less fimbriate; pygidium feebly 
bilaterally concave, rounded at apex.

Sphenophorus distichlidis, n. sp. 

Similar to mormon with which it agrees in the structure of the rostrum 
and, nearly, in the sculpture of the elytra. It averages a little smaller, 
with the entire surface subopaque, and with the legs and less frequently 
the elytra and thorax rufous or piceous. The punctua'ion is feeble, not 
so strong on the thorax, metasternum or abdominal segments as in sim 
plex. The tibiae are less angulate and more finely fimbriate, and the ante 
rior tibiae are normally without inside serration. 

Male. First and second abdominal segments moderately distinct ; pos 
terior tibias more strongly angulate and fimbriate. 

Female. First and second abdominal segments connate or nearly so at 
the middle; posterior tibiae feebly angulate and finely and sparsely fim 
briate. 

Length 8.5-11 5 mm; width 3.2-4.0 mm. 

Amedee, Cal., 4,200 ft, July 11-28, 1903. Collected by Mr. 
H. F. Wickham who has kindly presented a good series to the 
National Museum on Distichlidis spicata, a maritime grass 
which grows in salt marshes and saline spots. 

Type. No. 7878, U. S. National Museum. 

Sphenophorus simplex LeConte. 

In this species the normal shining jet black color is varied 
by individuals with more or less rufous legs, and the elytra are 
frequently piceous in evidently fully developed specimens. One 
otherwise deep black individual with velvety elytra has the base 
of the elytra and the legs bright rufous. In the smallest individ 
uals there are fewer rows of punctulations in the elytral intervals 
than in the larger. ones, and in the specimen last mentioned they 
are so minute as to be almost indistinguishable.

ON THE SPECIES OF SPHENOPHORUS HITHERTO CON 
SIDERED AS PLACIDUS SAY. 

By F. H. CHITTENDEN.

Curculionides," etc.,* described Rhynchophorus placidus with

the type locality " United States " he little guessed the trouble 
that this and other Sphenophori described at the same time 
would cause to the Coleopterist of the future. This was in 1831. 
When Horn, in 1873, in his Contributions to a Knowledge of 
the Curculionidae of the United States* brought together under 
Sphenophorus placidus no less than seven other names as 
synonyms, this merely added to the trouble. By careful study of 
many specimens, described and undescribed, that might possibly 
be attributed to Say's rectus or immtinis^ I am unable to find any 
which fits either description. The characterizations of Gyllen- 
hal and Boheman in Schoenherr's work on the Curculionidae 
are equally difficult of elucidation, and from all the circumstances 
in the case I feel convinced that only two species of this group 
can rightfully retain the older names, namely, venatus Say and 
reticulaticollis Boheman. The latter is described from u Cali 
fornia" which, at the time of its description, included a much 
larger territory than at present, and this locality and the descrip 
tion might very well be perpetuated for a species which I have 
assigned to that name. Several species have been present for 
years in collections under the name of placidus, in accordance 
with Horn's definition, which is, in brief, all Sphenophori of our 
fauna having a u slight fossa at the anterior median portion of the 
thorax immediately behind the apical constriction." The writer 
has been able to bring under this character seven species which 
cannot be placed elsewhere. All appear to be quite distinct, 
with the possible exceotion of vcstitus^ which is very different 
from venatus when we compare specimens of the former from 
Florida and of the latter from New England or Long Island. 
There is a possibility of gradation in an intermediate locality, but 
this has not been discovered. 

Still an eighth species which has been very generally included 
under placidus has been studied, and this proves to belong to an 
entirely different group. It may be distinguished from any 
species of the venatus group by its naked body, much longer, 
perfectly cylindrical rostrum with rounded apex, longer legs, 
thorax more narrowed anteriorly, broader thoracic vittae, divided 
apical fossa, and punctuation, which will be defined in the spe 
cific description, as well as sexual characters. It is peculiar to 
the Gulf region. The" following brief analysis of the venatus 
group follows :

Form and size of veuatus, from which and all others of this group it 
differs by the entire surface being more coarsely and strongly punctate, 
and by other characters which will be enumerated. Black, with dark 
brown pruinose coating evident at the sides and mostly abraded on the 
dorsum. Rostrum short, strongly compressed, obliquely truncate and 
produced in acute point posteriorly as in vestitus. Base very strongly 
and coarsely punctate, with interocular puncture in the form of a very 
irregular variable fossa, terminating anteriorly before or a little beyond 
the dilated portion above the scrobes in a broad ill-defined acuminate 
channel. Thoracic vittse, owing to strong and coarse punctuation, are 
feebly defined, the space between foveate-punctate and strongly confluent. 
Elvtral punctures so strong as to be subconfluent and often confluent 
transversely, producing with a natural uneven surface of the intervals a 
decided inequality of the entire surface. Sutural and third intervals with 
strong tendency to a double series of fine punctures most evident at the 
base.

The large deep punctures of the entire dorsal surface, and par 
ticularly of the elytra, produce an unevenness which impart to 
this insect an appearance quite different from all others in our 
fauna. 

It is probably quite common in Oregon, although not well 
distributed in collections.

Sphenophorus vestitus, n. sp. 

Closely related to venatus, more robust; surface with a dense, rather 
thin, more or less olive-tinted or brown alutaceous coating, which nor 
mally completely covers the entire dorsal surface except the thoracic 
vittse, rostrum, head, and portions of the legs, the lower surface except 
the middle of the metasternum, and the first and last abdominal segments, 
the excepted portions being polished black. Rostrum more arcuate and 
compressed, with the basal dilated portion normally coated. Thorax 
scarcely longer than wide, punctures between vittae frequently confluent. 
Lower surface moderately coarsely and densely punctate. First abdomi 
nal segment $ distinctly narrowly concave at middle, leaving an elevated 
portion each side ; last segment with punctures forming a shallow fossa 
at apex.

Sphenophorus neomexicanus, n. sp. 

Of similar form to venatus but considerably smaller, black, with base of 
rostrum, thorax and elytra frequently reddish. Surface coating velvety 
gray or brown, scarcely covering half the body. Rostrum with shallow 
fossa at base not coaled. Thorax feebly convex, subquadrate with apical 
fossa deep, vittae elevated, broad and shining, a little more finely and 
deeply punctate than interspaces and sides which are covered with coating. 
Scutellum black, shining, concave or divided at middle. Elytra partially 
covered with coating, leaving sutural, and base of third, fourth and fifth 
intervals, a large humeral and subapical spot black and shining; striae 
rather fine; interval punctures distinct, large, round and remotely placed 
(except sutural). Lower surface with sparse coating on sides ; sometimes 
bare, abdominal segments nearly uniformly, finely and somewhat densely 
punctate. Ventral concavity $ very shallow, scarcely deeper at middle 
of first abdominal. Pygidial characters as in reticulaticollis.

lected in the same locality and on the same days as reticulaticol- 
lis, but the two species have a distinct habitus and may be easily 
separated, there being no intergradation in the large series ex 
amined. 

Sphenophorus phceniciensis, n. sp. 

Form similar to -uestitus, smaller, ventral surface, head and rostrum 
shining black, antennae and tarsi piceous ; thorax variable, red, brown, or 
black, usually brighter on the sides of episterna; vittaa shining black; 
elytra rufous or dull light brown. Dorsal surface and sides covered with 
alutaceous coating, entirely grav or yellowish gray on sides, and pale 
reddish on elytra. 

Rostrum half as long as thorax, moderately arcuate and compressed, 
surface rather strongly and finely punctate, especially at base; base 
strongly dilated, suddenly above scrobes, where it is acutely angled; in- 
terocular fossa pyriform ; no channel; but a short impressed line extend 
ing in front of dilated portion. Apex divided anteriorly by a slightly ele 
vated line, posteriorly strongly and acutely produced. 

Thorax with constriction nearly as wide as long; apical constriction 
strong ; posterior three-fifths of remainder subparallel or slightly arcuate ; 
pattern of surface similar to venatus, apical fossa deep. Vittae very wide, 
occupying fully half the disc of thorax, shining black, slightly elevated, 
somewhat finely and sparsely punctate, lateral confluent with median just 
in front of middle. Interspaces coarsely, rather sparsely and irregularly 
punctate, sides near lateral vittee also sparsely but more finely punctate, 
on lateral margin becoming more dense. Scutellum flat, shining, decliv 
ous at base. 

Elytra one-fifth wider than thorax, one-fourth longer than wide, rather 
strongly acuminate to apex. Striae fine, finely and remotely punctate. 
Intervals unequal in width, subequal in convexity; 3 widest and most 
elevated, biseriately punctate ; the remainder uniseriately punctate ; i very 
finely, punctures closely placed ; humeral and subapical callosities small 
and smoothly shining. Lower surface somewhat densely coated, but not 
more than half covered at the sides; abdominal segments nearly uni 
formly, finely and somewhat densely punctate, a little more finely than at 
the sides. Legs finely and sparsely punctate. Tibiae sparsely and feebly 
fimbriate on inner surface ; anterior tibiae with outer angle slightly pro 
longed, others obliquely truncate, with inner angle acutely produced into 
a long spur; subapical spur distinct but only about one-fourth as long. 
Pygidium with coarse, shallow punctures, somewhat densely placed, 
coated with very short silvery hairs, with minute tufts each side of apex, 
which is moderately narrowed and rounded. 

As the above description was drawn entirely from female ex 
amples, and the male, which has been recently received, is rep 
resented by a single specimen, the sexual differences may be 
found less striking with more material for comparison.

Male. Lower surface more strongly punctate; especially in ventral 
concavity which is moderately deep, strongly sloping toward the center, 
especially in the metasternum; pygidium subpentagonal with rounded 
base.

Type. No 7905, U. S. National Museum. 

Although closely resembling in a superficial manner others of 
the venatus group, this species has very pronounced characters, 
showing some affiliation to neomexicanus. From the latter it is 
separable by its finer punctuation alone, besides being more 
robust, its proportions resembling those of vestitus. It is not 
improbable that the coloration of the species may vary still more, 
since none of the specimens examined are true to any type ; and 
it is also probable that the same species extends into Mexico. 

Sphenophorus reticulaticollis Boheman. 

Of the same form as vena/us, a little smaller; body dull red, rostrum 
(except fossa at base), femora, tibiae and occiput black; surface with a soft 
velvety natural alutaceous coating, mostly red on the dorsal surface and 
gray on the sides, completely covering the dorsal surface, except portions 
of the thoracic vittse, the scutellum, humeral, and subapical callosities, 
not covering the metasternum and middle of abdomen. Punctuation of 
entire surface of body distinct and rather dense; on thorax, which is 
feebly convex, nearly uniform and but little finer on the feebly elevated 
and very narrow vittae; on elytra strial punctures large, interval punc 
tures very fine and obscure, on sutural intervals minute and very closely 
placed. Metasternum and first abdominal segment nearty uniformly 
sparsely foveate-punctate, second abdominal but little coarser than third 
and fourth. In $ the ventral concavity is shallow but moderately deep 
in the middle of the first abdominal, and the pygidium is subquadrangular 
with apex rounded. In 9 pygidium is somewhat pentagonal with minute 
lateral tufts.

NEW DIPTERA FROM INDIA AND AUSTRALIA. 
By D. W. CoqyiLLETT. 

Mr. George Compere, a native of this country and for several 
years an inspector of fruit pests at Los Angeles, California, but 
at present the government entomologist of West Australia, re 
cently transmitted to Dr. L. O. Howard, for naming, an interest 
ing series of bred insects from that country and India, the Diptera 
of which were assigned to the writer for study and report. An 
extended search through the literature of these and the neighbor 
ing regions has failed to reveal any descriptions applicable to five 
of the species, and in the belief that they are as yet undescribed, 
they are duly characterized herewith :

TWO NEW SPECIES OF CADDICE-FL1ES. 
By NATHAN BANKS. 

The following two species of caddice-flies were collected at 
Wellington, British Columbia, by two local collectors, Rev. G. 
W. Taylor and Mr. Theo. Bryant. Both are large and striking 
species, one handsomely marked for a caddice-fly ; the other of 
rather peculiar shape. One of them constitutes a new genus, 
GlypJtopsyche, which includes also a species recently described 
as Glyphotcelius bellus. I have named the species in honor ot 
the collectors, who have done so much to make known the insect 
fauna of their region. 

Halesus taylori, n. sp. 

Head black, with black hair, and some yellowish hair on clypeus ; palpi 
yellowish ; antennae black, beneath faintly, but plainly, crenulate, basal 
joint not as long as vertex; prothorax yellow, with long yellow hair; 
thorax black, lateral lobes of mesothorax and the mesoscutellum yellow, 
and with yellow hair. Abdomen black; legs yellow, with black spines. 
Anterior wings hyaline, most of the veins marked broadly with dark

brown, and the pterostigma brown; the subcosta and radius narrowly 
bordered with brown, the radial sector, median and cubitus more heavily 
margined; the mark on the median does not reach the posterior anasto 
mosis; the region behind the anal vein is brown, the apical veins are 
bordered with brown on their apical two-thirds, the first and second sub- 
apicals are marked mostly on their basal portions with brown, and the 
third is brown to the tip; the cell behind it entirely brown. Sometimes 
these apical markings are heavier so as to nearly run together; however 
there is always a pale area across basal part of the apicals. In the hind 
wings the ptemstigma is brown and the apex narrowly clouded. The 
venation is very similar to that of Halesns hottis except that the first and 
fifth apical cells do not extend basad of the anastomosis. Expanse 35 mm. 

Several specimens from Wellington, British Columbia (Taylor 
and Bryant). 

Glyphopsyche, n. gen. 

Spurs i, 3, 4. Apical margin of forewings distinctly and evenly exca 
vate ; pterostigma elliptical, almost closed at base by the sudden up-bend 
ing of the vein ; discal cell very long; membrane of wings finely rugulose, 
more distinct at pterostigma; basal joints of antennae almost as long as 
vertex. 

This genus has much resemblance to Glyphotcelius, but differs 
in more prominent pterostigma, in the much smaller prothorax, 
and different shape of head. 

Type. G. bryanti. 

Glyphotcelius bellus Banks, recently described, also falls in 
this genus. It differs from the type not only in color, but in 
having the ist apical cell extending a little on discal cell, and the 
^th apical not acute at base, although narrowed. 

Glyphopsyche bryanti, n. sp. 

Head black, with some short white hair, particularly prominent near 
margin of eyes ; palpi black; antennae yellowish brown; prothorax yel 
lowish above, with white hair, and black hair on the sides ; mesothorax 
dark brown, with a broad grayish-white stripe in'the middle, less distinct 
on metathorax. Abdomen dark brown ; legs dull yellowish, with black 
spines, the tips of tibiae and tarsal joints narrowly brown. Wings brown, 
darker beyond anastomosis ; the costal area (and sometimes elsewhere) 
shows many pale irregular spots ; before middle of wings there is an 
oblique white space between median and cubital veins. In the base of the 
third apical there is a very distinct circular white spot. At the margin 
there is a narrow white spot in the middle of each apical cell ; those in 
the subapicals I and II are broader and nearly touch, that in the third sub- 
apical is very small ; behind the anal veins are a few pale spots and streaks. 
The first apical does not extend back on the discal cell, and the fifth is

acute or even short pedicellate at base. In the hind wings the apical part 
is faintly fumose, and the pterostigma a little darker.

TWO NEW FORMS OF CENE1S Huebner. 
By HARRISON G. DYAR. 

Mr. Merritt Gary collected a number of specimens of CEnels 
(Chionobas) in British America in 1903, and among them are 
two forms that do not agree with any known to me. 

GEneis caryi, n. var. 

Gray brown above, washed with dark ferruginous red submarginally on 
fore wings, over most of surface of hind wings; two large black ocelli on 
fore wings above veins 2 and 5, respectively, one on the hind wings near 
anal angle, the three minutely white pupilled and repeated below. Fore 
wings below reddish on the disk and inner margin ; hind wings contrast 
ingly marbled in black and white, the median band strongly white edged.

Near norna Thunberg, but the red color of the wings is much 
darker and more rust colored than in this form or in katahdin 
Newcomb. 



CEneis nahanni, n. sp. 

Blackish above, washed with ferruginous* orown, trie veins darker, the 
markings of underside showing. A small ocellus or none above vein 5 on 
fore wings, two to five on hind wings, the one above vein 5 largest, the rest 
small or absent. Hind wings below black and white, coarsely strigose, 
somewhat as in uhleri Reakirt and 'vtiruim Edwards, but much more 
densely, the white of the wing being largely obscured. Median band 
weakly indicated; ocelli black with white pupils; fore wings shaded with

DIVERSE MOSQUITO LARVAE THAT PRODUCE SIMILAR 

ADULTS. 

By HARRISON G. DYAR and FREDERICK KNAB. 

In going over somewhat carefully the material in Culicid larvas 
that has been gathered by Dr. Howard to be figured, the writers 
have met in more than one instance with diverse larvae that pro 
duced adults so similar that they have not been differentiated 
with the material now at hand. As examples we cite : 

Culex cantans Meigen. 

1. What we have considered as the normal form has the air 
tube about three-and-a-half times as long as wide, the pecten con 
sisting of two rows of teeth with the distal two or three detached. 
The tracheal tubes are broad, band-shaped, slightly waved seg- 
mentarily, broadened within the air tube. The long abdominal 
hairs on segments 3 to 6 are single ; the hairs on the head are in 
tufts of two or three centrally, five in the tuft next the antennae. 

2. The second form has the air tube about four times as long 
as wide, the pecten of evenly spaced teeth without any detached. 
The tracheal tubes are very narrow, uniform, strongly bent seg- 
mentarily, especially in abdominal segment 7, where they form 
acute angles, likewise narrow within the air tube. The long ab 
dominal hairs on segments 3 to 6 are double ; the hairs on the 
head have three to four hairs in the central tufts, about nine in 
the tuft next the antennas. 

Both forms have been taken at Springfield, Mass., by Dr. Geo. 
Dimmock and Mr. F. Knab, in temporary pools in fields and 
woods formed by the melting of the snow in the spring. 

There must be two species here in spite of the apparent simi 
larity of the adults. 

Culex restuans Theobald. 

1. The usual form has the air tube about three-and-a-half times 
as long as wide, slightly fusiform, strongly tapering to the tip, 
furnished with about six scattered hairs, coarse, single, only the 
one nearest the tip sometimes in the form of a small tuft. The 
anal processes may be much elongated. 

2. The other form has the tube about four times as long as 
wide, slender, not fusiform, gradually tapering, the only hair a 
small tuft beyond the outer third. Otherwise, as in the usual 
form, the antennas and the peculiarly shaped labial plate being 
the same. 

Both forms have been taken at Cummington, Mass., by Mr. 
F. Knab, in a ' ; pothole " in a rock, about six feet above the level 
of the Westfield river, in company with C. atropalpus Coq. 



144 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

The usual form we have from many other places, such as St. 
Anthony Park, Minn. (F. L. Washhurn) ; Center Harbor, N. H. 
(H. G. Dyar) ; Durham, N. H. (H. G. Dyar) ; Ithaca, N. Y. 
(O. A. Johannsen) ; Saranac Tnn, N. Y. (O. A. Johannsen) ; 
Lahaway, N. J. (J. T. Brakeley) ; Baltimore, Md. (Dyar and 
Caudellf; Washington, D. C. "(H. G. Dyar); St. Asaph, Va. 
(F. C. Pratt), in temporary pools, roadside puddles, water bar 
rels, etc. The second form has been mentioned by Dr. John B. 
Smith.* as collected by him at Lahawav, N. J., and he considers 
it specifically distinct from restuans. The differential character 
which he mentions between the labial plates of the two forms is, 
however, not existant in our specimens.

1. The usual form has the air tube about two-and-a-half times 
as long as wide, thick, tapered outwardly, the pecten followed bv 
a single tuft. Anal segment with slight tufts before the barred 
area. The lateral comb of the Sth abdominal segment consists of 
a large patch of small spines over three rows deep. On the head 
the upper frontal tuft consists of six hairs, the lower of three, the 
one near the antennae of seven. 

2. The other form has the air tube of the same proportions, but 
the pecten Iras three or four large detached teeth which extend 
well beyond the tuft, almost to the apex of the tube. There are 
besides on the ventral aspect, two small tufts and two rows of 
long tufts on the dorsal side. The anal segment has ventral tufts 
almost to the base. The lateral comb of the Sth abdominal seg 
ment consists of a small patch of large, thorn-shaped spines in an 
irregular double row. The head hairs have three in the upper 
frontal tuft, one in the lower, seven in the tuft near the antenna;. 

The first form we have abundantly irom Kaslo, B. C.,f the sec 
ond form from Kaslo also, and from Springfield, Mass., where it 
was collected by Dr. Geo. Dimmock, under the number 2173. 
At present the adults have not been separated ; but in this case 
we hope that they may yet prove to be distinguishable, for our 
bred series of the second form is very small and not well pre 
served. Better material may show differences. The larvae are 
certainly abundantly distinct.

The rS6th regular meeting 1 was held at the Saengerbund Hall, 
3140 street, N.W., Vice-President Banks in the chair, and Messrs. 
Ashmead, Barber, Benton. Busck, Caudell, Currie, Dyar, Gill, 
Heidemann, Kotinsky, Morris, Patten, Schwarz and Ulke, mem 
bers, and Mr. Frederick Knab, visitor, present. 

Mr. Schwarz exhibited some fruit of the wild fig tree found 
at Cayamas, Cuba, and specimens of the insects found in them. 
At Cayamas only four trees of Ficus were found in the timber 
all of them of very tall growth, the lowest branches being from 
40 to 50 feet above ground, so that no close observation could be 
made. In the middle of February bird droppings on the leaves 
of various low shrubbery were noticed to be composed of seeds of 
tigs intermingled with minute insect remains. About the same 
time scattered specimens of the hymenoptcrous genus Idarnes 
a well-known parasite of Blastophaga could be found flying 
about in the woods. Finally, from one of these trees the drop 
ping of ripe figs commenced at the rate of about four in one 
minute and many thousands of figs dropped from this one tree in 
the course of a few days. An investigation of these fallen figs 
showed that they were male figs, /. e., every one of the seeds 
was a gall flower inhabited by the true caprificators (Blasto 
phaga} or by parasites belonging to the genus Idarnes. Not a 
single specimen of a female Blastophaga was found in the falling 
figs, but only males, averaging in number from seven to twenty 
in one fig. Both <$ and 9 specimens of the parasitic Idarnes 
abounded in the figs. These parasites issue from a single hole 
in the side of the fig, but it appears that they can issue only at a 
certain period in the ripening of the fruit, for many figs were found 
in which the Idarnes had been unable to escape and had died. 
Mr. Schwarz has come to the conclusion that the particular tree 
from which the figs were dropping was a caprifig tree, /. ., a 
male tree, and, to all appearance, of the same character as the 
caprifig tree in the Smyrna figs. The other trees, from which 
not a single fig was falling, were, it may be inferred, either female 



146 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

trees or trees whose flowers are adapted to carrying on the sub 
sequent generations of the fig insects. 

Dr. Ashmead asked Mr. Schwarz if these Cuban figs belonged 
to one of the species found in Florida. Mr. Schwarz replied 
that he did not know. Dr. Ashmead stated that there are three 
kinds of wild Ficus in Florida. Mr. Schwarz asked Dr. Ash 
mead whether the species of Blastophaga could be determined 
from male specimens. Dr. Ashmead replied that they could. 

Mr. Barber exhibited some hymenopterous cocoons which 
he had found at Williams, Arizona, in 1901. He said that the 
cocoons were beaten from oak shrubs and were observed to be 
capable of making jumping movements. Their jumping capacity 
amounted to about one-fourth of an inch. After consulting the 
literature Mr. Barber found that they belong to the genus 
Limneria and that at an early period, viz., by GeofTrov at the 
beginning of the last century, the jumping habits of the cocoon 
had been observed. Dr. Ashmead then said that Limneria be 
longed to the Ichneumonid tribe Campoplegini, containing some 
sixty-five genera, all members of which have cocoons of this kind. 

Mr. Benton stated that the Japanese had just translated into 
their own language the bulletin on the honey bee published by 
the U. S. Department of Agriculture.* A copy of the translation 
was passed around for inspection. 

Dr. Ashmead reported that a collection of nearly 20.0 species 
of Japanese parasitic Hymenoptera had recently been received 
by the IT. S. National Museum from Dr. S. Matsumura, Agri 
cultural College, Sapporo, Japan. The collection contains 
many interesting forms. f 

Mr. Banks exhibited a specimen of the Neuropteron Man- 
tispa viridis. This species was described by Walker from 
.eastern Florida, and Hagen, who had never seen it, thought that, 
owing to its green color foreign to other known Mantispidae 
it must have been a manufactured insect. But the receipt by 
Mr. Banks of a specimen from Florida, collected by Mrs. A. T.

Slosson, and of one from Nicaragua, collected by Prof. C. F. 
Baker, shows that the species exists in nature. 

Mr. Banks mentioned having a specimen of the stonefly 
Acroneurla ruralis (Hagen) in which one fore leg is but one- 
third its proper size, indicating that this leg had probably been 
lost and then replaced. This, he said, would furnish the first 
record in the Perlidae of regeneration of appendages. He stated 
that in spiders of the family Thomisidag it was very common to 
find specimens in which one of the legs was of reduced size. He 
has in his collection, also, a spider of the family Attidae, Dendry- 
ph antes bifida Banks, in which one front leg is much reduced 
in size and lacks the spiny armature. This is the first record of 
the kind in the family Attidae. 

Mr. Schwarz said that during his stay at Cayamas, Cuba, he 
came across a gigantic net of the social spider Uloborus republi- 
canus Simon (as determined byMr. Banks). From the excellent 
paper by Mr. E. Simon* it was to be seen that socialism in 
Arachnida is of very rare occurrence, and that no case has hitherto 
been reported from the West Indies, Uloborus republicanus 
having been described and previously known only from Venezuela. 
Mr. Schwarz said that he was not prepared to see a net of such 
gigantic proportions. It occupied nearly the whole crown of a 
felled tree. Its width, naturally irregular in outline, was from 
seven to nine feet, its height from five to seven feet, while its depth 
averaged three feet. The whole structure exactly resembled the 
figure given by Mr. Simon. The male spiders, easily distin 
guished by their brown color from the females, occupied one of 
the lowermost corners of the net. An attempt was made to 
count the individual spiders or spider webs, but after 200 speci 
mens were counted the attempt was abandoned. Mr, Schwarz 
estimated that upward of 1,000 specimens were the occupants of 
this structure. The whole net formed a most perfect trap for all 
insects that flew through the clearing made by the felled tree, 
and the individual webs of the spiders were found to be full of 
insects of all kinds, but more especially of various Diptera which 
are common in Cuba during the winter months, viz., one or two

species of Hippelates and a species of Hormomyia all of them 
very troublesome pests to man. Mr. Schwarz said that he had 
nothing to add to Mr. Simon's excellent account, and he wished 
to testify as to the correctness of the latter's illustration of the net. 
Three other nets of the same social spider were found near by, 
but these were of greatly inferior size, the largest of them being 
occupied by about 300 spiders. 

In discussion of this note Mr. Banks reviewed the literature of 
the social spiders as given in Mr. Simon's article. He stated 
that the nearest approach to a social spider in the United States 
is Theridium studiosum Hentz, which is very closely related to 
7\ socialis Simon. In this country one frequently finds several 
webs of Hyptiotes, the nearest genus to Uloborus, on the same 
dried branch, but not connected. Dr. Gill asked whether there 
is a discrepancy in size between the two sexes of Uloborus, and 
mentioned a Madagascar spider, Nephila madagascarensis 
Vinson, in which the female is more than 100 times as large as 
the male. Mr. Banks replied that in our Nephila pluinipes 
Koch the male is just as small in proportion as in the Mada 
gascar species. Mr. Schwarz said that the male of Nephila 
plumipes is just as common as the female, but that it is easily 
overlooked from its small size and from the fact that it always 
occurs opposite the large body of the female on the other side of 
the web. It appeared to him that on account of its extremely 
small size and from the fact, just mentioned, that it is always on 
the other side of the web, that it is well protected from the 
cannibalistic habits of the female Nephila. Dr. Ash mead men 
tioned the genus Gasteracantha as an instance among spiders in 
which the male is smaller than the female. Mr. Banks remarked, 
however, that the disparity in size in that genus is not nearly so 
great as in Nephila. Mr. Caudell stated that it is not uncommon 
to find numbers of spiders huddled together in one place in 
winter. Mr. Banks said that he did not consider this an example 
of socialism ; the spiders simply happened to seek the same place 
for hibernation. -

NOTES ON THE STRUCTURE OF THE THORAX AND 
MAXILLAE IN INSECTS. 

By NATHAN BANKS. 
(PLATE I.) 

When one looks at the complicated structure of the thorax in 
a fty or a bee, it seems almost impossible to tell much of the 
origin of the parts. But it is not so difficult to unravel the tangle 
if we start at the right end. Several years ago while looking at 
some Chilopods one point in the solution occurred to me. I 
published upon it at that time, and since then have often been 
confirmed in the view then expressed that the segments of the 
thorax are compound. It is generally admitted to day (more so 
than ten years ago) that the Chilopods are closely related to the 
ancestors of the winged insects ; and no one, I think, can study 
them. without arriving at that conclusion. 

If we look at one of the lower and simpler Chilopods, as a 
Geophilus or Mecistocephalus (Plate I, fig. S), we will notice 
that the head is followed by a series of segments, subequal in size, 
each bearing a pair of legs, and (except the first) spiracles. If 
one examines a more compact Chilopod, as Scolopocryptops, two 
kinds of segments are seen, the larger with spiracles, the smaller 
without them. In Lithobius (Plate I, fig. i) this process has 
gone further, the small segments are smaller, the large are larger, 
and overlap or even cover the small ones. In Cermatia the dor 
sal scutas of the small segments have coalesced with the large 
segments. This, I believe, has happened to all insects ; what we 
consider a segment of the thorax being really two segments 
united. There are various external points of proof. One that I 
previously advanced is that in Machilis there are jointed append 
ages to the abdomen which appear to represent legs. Similar 
appendages are attached to the middle and hind coxae ; these, 
then, may represent the legs to the other segments of the thorax. 
Three years ago Mr. Walton called attention to the structure ot 
the coxa, showing that there are present the basal parts of two ap 
pendages ; the trochantin and epimeron representing basal joints 
of a leg now no further developed. He reasoned from this that 
the thorax was compound. He did not then know of my article. 
I have given (Plate I, fig. 7) a side view of the coxa of a Pa- 
norpa where one can see that the coxa shows these two sets of 
basal joints. This appearance is readily noted in most Neurop- 
tera (very clearly so in Psocidae), and can be made out by a little 
study on many of the higher insects. 

In my note of ten years ago I stated that I thought the pro- 
thorax might not be compound, but now I consider that it is 



150 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

formed of two segments as are the meso- and metathorax. One 
will see that this is probable by a glance at the figure of a Litho- 
bius (Plate I, fig. i). Many insects show a transverse groove 
on the pronotum. It is seen that the spiracles of the small 
segments have disappeared in Lithobius. This has a direct bear 
ing on the question, if it be true (as the best evidence seems to 
show) that the wings of insects originate from rudimentary 
spiracles. Since there are not in the lowest Chilopod any spir 
acles on the first segment, this will explain why there have been 
no prothoracic wings in insects. If we look again at a Lithobius 
(Plate I, fig. i) we notice that behind the thorax is a segment 
not followed by a smaller one. This will become the median 
segment of insects, in some forms united to the thorax. 

Are the abdominal segments of insects compound? I do not 
know of positive evidence, but in looking at Lithobius one would 
think that the abdominal segments were also compound. In many 
insects there are indications of transverse division on some of the 
abdominal segments. Still one cannot argue too literally from 
Lithobius, for Lithobius is not the ancestor of insects but only 
closely related thereto. 

If we compare the head end of the lower and higher Chilopods 
we notice that there has been an increase in the size of the poison- 
claw, and a more or less definite coalescence with the head. It 
would seem, therefore, that in insects a more complete coalescence 
has been accomplished. And it is so. The Chilopod (Plate I, 
figs, i, 5, 6, 8) has a pair of mandibles ; a lip with jointed lobes 
each side ; a pair of slender jointed appendages, sometimes called 
maxillae ; and the poison-claws overlapping all. What has 
become of these parts in insects? If we examine the larva of 
a Perlid (Plate I, figs. 2, 4), we see mandibles, lip with lobes 
or palpus, and a complicated maxilla. In side view, this looks 
much like the poison-claw, and it is. In some Perlid larvas, one 
can, with a little care, separate the maxilla into two separate and 
independent structures, without rupturing the teguments. The 
inner part is the palpus, with its own basal joints, normally con 
cealed by the stipes and cardo. The outer and larger part is the 
old poison-claw, now galea and lacinia. In most insects the 
pressure of the former poison-claw against the palpus has resulted 
in a coalescence and twisting of parts. However, in many insects 
(Carabidae, etc.), the galea is divided into two segments, thus 
showing that it represents an appendage as well as the palpus. 
The lacinia, I should guess, is developed from a spur at the base 
of a joint. A similar articulated piece is found in the mandibles 
of some beetles (as Cetonidaa). Thus I believe that the maxilla? 
of insects represent two pairs of appendages fused together at 
base ; and that each segment of the insect thorax is composed of 
two primitive segments. 



OF WASHINGTON. 151. 

I shall not now go into the rise of the clypeus and labrum, 
only to note that in the Chilopod there is a piece bent down 
between the large and approximate antennas, which, as the an 
tennae separate, will become more prominent, and as the mouth 
moves forward will become dorsal in position. 

Regarding the history of the compound thorax theory, it may 
be well to record that Hagen in 1889 said he thought each seg 
ment was composed of three, one each for the legs, the spiracles, 
and the wings ; but his views are not at all in line with mine, 
and were -unknown to me in 1893 when I broached my theory. 
In 1900 Mr. Walton, upon studying the coxa, concluded that the 
thorax was composed of six segments. He was then unaware of 
the papers by Hagen and myself. Kolbe in his " Einfuhrung " 
gives practically the same version of the segmentation of the 
thorax that I have given. Kolbe's work was finished late in 1893, 
but was issued in parts, and the part dealing with this matter 
must have appeared about 1891 , although unknown to me in 
1893. 

Since I have written this paper (which was on the program for 
presentation last fall) I have seen a paper by Verhoeff (published 
in May, 1903), in which he accepts the compound nature of the 
thorax and gives names to the parts, as follows : 
between head and prothorax Microthorax ; 
between pro- and mesothorax Stenothoiax ; 
between meso- and metathorax Cryptothorax. 

He shows that in Japyx the cryptothorax still retains the 
spiracle, and he finds traces of these segments in various insects.

Dr. Gill asked Mr. Banks whether his views as to the mouth 
parts of insects corresponded with those of Prof. John B. Smith. 
Mr. Banks replied that he did not believe that Prof. Smith's 
investigations had been carried on along the same line as his 
own. He did not believe that Prof. Smith suspected that the 
maxilla was a compound organ. 

The subject of Myriapoda and their relation to insects and 
other Arthropods was discussed by Messrs. Morris, Gill, Banks 
and Ashmead. Dr. Gill said he thought Mr. Banks' theories as 
set forth in his paper just read were plausible, although, of 
course, it remained to be seen whether further investigation 
would bear them out. 

Mr. Schwarz exhibited and described a structure made by a 
Psyllid larva on the leaves or young shoots of Piscidia ery- 
thrina, the fish-killing plant of the West Indies, at Key West, 
Florida, and at Cayatnas, Cuba. He stated that among the 
numerous species of North American Psyllidas there are com 
paratively few that are gall-makers, or that cause deformations 
in the various parts of the plant they affect. Only two nest- 
making or nest-spinning Psyllidae have hitherto been known, 
and these only from Australia, /. <?., the genera Spondyliaspis 
and Cardiaspis, as explained by him in a paper read before the 
Society some time ago.* The species from Key West forms a

nest-like, globular structure of whitish color, usually along the mid 
ribs of the fully developed leaves (fig. 3). Upon examination the 
wall of this structure is seen to be composed of fine, cotton-like 
threads. When inhabited by the larvas the nests are of a sticky 
nature, but old specimens become brittle in time. They are fastened 
to the leaves by a broad base so that the larva, in feeding, is forced 
to push its beak through this space into the parenchyma of the leaf. 
A large number of the adult Psyllids were bred from the speci 
mens from Key West, but unfortunately none of them were in 
perfect condition, so that the systematic position of the Psyllid, 
viz., whether it belongs to the Aphalarinae or the PsylHnae, 
remains in doubt. Mr. Schwarz stated that from the character 
of the larvae it would appear that the species belongs to the 




FIG. 3. "Sest making Psyllid from Key West, Florida. 

Psyllinae rather than to the Aphalarinae, the wing parts in the 
former subfamily' being more oval'and more towards the sides of 
the body ; whereas in the Aphalarinae the wing parts are of a more 
quadrangular shape and more towards the dorsal portion of the 
body. In this connection Mr. Schwarz reviewed the larval 
habits of such American Psyllidas as have hitherto been studied 
biologically. 

In discussion Mr. Busck stated that he, also, saw this Psyllid at 
Key West, Florida. Dr. Ashmead said that since Mr. Schwarz's 
paper on the nest-making Australian Psyllidae the subject has 
been taken up by Mr. Froggatt in Australia. Other species of 
the genera Spondyliaspis and Cardiaspis have been described 
by the latter author, but no progress has been made in our 
knowledge of the peculiar structures made by their larvae.

The iSyth regular meeting was held at the Sasngerbund Hall, 314 
C street, N.W., Vice-President Hopkins in the chair, and Messrs. 
Ashmead, Benton, Currie, Dyar, Gill, Heidemann, Kotinsky 
and Ulke, members, and Mr. Frederick Knab, visitor, pres 
ent. The Corresponding Secretary presented a report. Among 
other publications he reported the receipt from Baron C. R. 
Osten Sacken of the latter's autobiography entitled " Record of 
My Life Work in Entomology."* A copy of the work was shown- 
Mr. Ulke stated that he became acquainted with Baron Osten 
Sacken in 1856, the latter having come to Washington at that 
time. He gave some personal reminiscences of the Baron. 

Mr. S. Arthur Johnson, First Assistant in Zoology in the 
State Agricultural College, Fort Collins, Colorado, and Mr. 
Frederick Knab, temporarily residing at 729 Thirteenth street 
N.W.. were elected to corresponding membership. , 

Dr. Dyar showed a copy of Rothschild and Jordan's "A 
Revision of. the Lepidopterous family Sphingidae,"f and stated how 
their changes in the generic names had been arrived at. Their 
method of determining the types of composite genera differs 
from that usually employed in the three following particulars : 
(i) No generic name is to be recognized unaccompanied by some 
sort of printed description; (2) the first species of a composite 
genus is to be regarded as the type ; (3) a subsequent genus 
containing the type of a preceding one is a synonym thereof, 
whether its first species be the same or not. 

Under (i ) Hiibner's Tentamen names and all catalogue names 
are rejected, even though accompanied by the plain designation 
of a species as the type, while every name is accepted that has 
some sort of description attached, even if that description con 
tains not a single character that will define the genus. Dr. Dyar 
said he thought that the line had been drawn arbitrarily by these 
authors. A name accompanied only by some well-known species 
as type is often more intelligible and useful than another with 
a long description which gives no essential characters.

(2) The taking of the first species of a genus as the type is 
defended as an extension of the rule of priority. It is also 
defended as the shortest and least laborious method and the one 
most likely to produce uniformity. Dr. Dyar agreed with the 
authors that it was certainly easy and a most gratifying relief 
from the labors incidental to any attempts to arrive at the types 
of genera by the method of elimination. This method had, he 
said, been rather a dismal failure, so far as applied to insects. 
No two authors seem capable of arriving at the same results in a 
particular case. He was inclined to attribute this to faulty 
research, and he supposed that when all the literature had been 
examined a finality would be arrived at. However, if general 
consent were to be obtained he admitted that this new method 
would save an immense amount of irksome labor. The principal 
objection to it seems to be that it has not been generally adopted 
in other branches of zoology. A uniform method of determin 
ing types of genera should obtain throughout the animal king 
dom. Therefore, until a change shall have been effected in the 
rules of nomenclature the generally accepted method of elimination 
should be continued. Dr. Dyar said that it might be further 
urged that the method did not do justice to the writings of sub 
sequent authors, and the student would be inclined to omit 
studying them. 

As to (3) Dr. Dyar failed to see why it was propounded. It 
does away with some names which. have, strictly, little right to 
be recognized, yet which might be retained if rule (2) were 
allowed to cover those cases as well. Two genera containing 
exactly the same species might then be preserved if their first 
species was different. Dr. Dyar could not see any harm in this, 
and he believed that the less rules there were in force the better 
it would be for simplicity. 

Dr. Gill said that as applied to the Linneean genera the method 
of taking the first species as type was unsound. Linnseus placed 
his species in a graded sequence, those connecting one group 
with another being placed at the beginning and the end. The 
really typical forms would be found in the middle of the genus 
and the first species often contradicts the diagnosis in one or even 
several particulars, as is the case with Squalus pristis. 

Dr. Dyar said that the method of elimination was calculated 



OF WASHINGTON. 157 

to produce no better results. The frequent outcome of its appli 
cation was to determine as the type the most obscure and least 
known species of the genus. Thus, in Hiibner's genera in the 
" Verzeichniss " not only are the well-known European forms 
included but they are followed by those known to Hiibner only 
by Cramer's figures and which fall in these genera owing to 
Hiibner's definitions being based on pattern of markings and 
coloration. It is perfectly natural that subsequent authors re 
move first those well-known European species, leaving the type 
of Hiibner's term to fall upon some South American form usually 
belonging to another family and which was autoptically unknown 
to Hiibner. In this case the method of taking the first species as 
type produces better results and is more just to the author. 

Dr. Ash mead pointed out that the action of previous authors 
should be taken into account and their determinations of types, 
when justified by the rules, should be binding and ought not 
to be changed. This not only in justice to the authors but in 
obedience to the rule of priority. 

Dr. Ashmead stated that he had received another consign- 

& 

ment of Philippine Hymenoptera from Father W. A. Stanton of 
the Philippine Weather Bureau, Manila, P. I. The collection 
contained about thirty-one new species additions to his recently 
published list of Philippine Hymenoptera and, to a large extent, 
representing families not before known from the Philippines. 

Dr. Hopkins informed the Society that he had just received 
a letter from Mr. Burke, now in Washington State investigating 
forest insects, in which the latter stated that he had succeeded, 
by fastening little cages to the trees, in capturing emerging adults 
of the Syrphid fly whose larva, as ascertained by him last sum 
mer, is destructive to the Western hemlock. The larva lives in, 
or under, the bark, entering by a wound made by a woodpecker 
or Scolytid beetle and, enlarging it, causes an accumulation of 
pitch and makes a bad defect in the wood. Dr. Ashmead re 
called that in Florida he had found certain Syrphid larvas living 
in the bark of pine. 

Dr. Hopkins mentioned that on his recent trip into the 
southern States, he had observed that certain Scolytid beetles 
whose range extends from the West Indies north into the United 
States' are smaller as one goes southward, showing, in his 
opinion, that they were originally northern species.

Hulst's 9 type is before me. It has not the contrasts of black 
shades shown in Ragonot's figure,* but these shades are barely 
mentioned in the text and not at all in the original description, so 
it appears that the figure is either over colored or made from an 
unusually dark specimen. The species belongs to Euzophera 
rather than to Honora as the cell of the hind wings is long, beino" 
nearly half the length of the wing.

Not Vitula serratilineella Hampson, Rom. Mem., vm, PI. XLII, fig. 
12, 1901. 

The species belongs to Vitula as originally placed by Ragonot, 
since the ^ has none of the peculiar characters described for 
Eccopisa Zeller. Hampson places it positively in this genus, f but 
without good reason, for he had no ^, as the citations in the text 
show. The figure (PL XLIX, fig. 23) is a fair representation of 
the species, but the second figure (PI. XLII, fig. 12) is quite a dif 
ferent insect, apparently belonging to another genus, and a male, 
if the drawing is to be trusted. The generic term Eccopsia is 
due to a misreading of Dr. Hulst's manuscript or to a clerical 
error of his; he evidently intended to write Eccopisa Zeller. I 
had to supply the authors' names and the references and, not find 
ing Eccopsia, thought it one of the new names being proposed 
by Ragonot in Vol. VIII of the Romanoff Memoirs, not then 
available. The term Eccopsia (Ragonot) Hulst will be cited as 

*Rom. Mem., vin, PI. xxv, fig. 25.

a synonym of Vitula, type serratilineella Ragonot. There is 
no known American species of Eccopisa Zeller.

The name Laosticha is another error in preparing Dr. Hulst's 
manuscript for Bulletin 52- The name originally communicated 
to Dr. Hulst was evidently Lasiosticha Meyrick. But I can see 
no reason for referring the Arizonian species to this Australian 
genus. Lasiosticha is characterized by having a thick ridge of 
scales on the $ antennas from base to middle, as stated in the text 
of Ragonot's monograph and shown in the figure,* while Rago 
not says of ephestiella, $ antennas simple, filiform, feebly pubes 
cent. The venation is stated to be as in coccidivora Comstock, 
but vein 2 of hind wings a little before end of cell and vein 8 very 
short. I would refer it to Lcetilia of which Lacsticha (Ragonot) 
Hulst will become a synonym. The genus Lasiosticha Meyrick 
should be considered unrepresented in America.

Sahiria ardiferella Hulst, Bull. 52, U. S. Nat. Mus., p. 439, 1902. 

This species cannot belong to Tolima, as vein 2 of the hind 
wings is distant from the angle of the cell, nor to Aurora, as vein 
10 of fore wings is from the cell, nor to Saluria, as there is no 
frontal tubercle. Altoona is made a synonym of Tolima by 
Ragonot, but I have seen no male and cannot say whether the 
antennas in this species have a tuft of scales or not. I assume 
that they do, in placing the species in Pectinigera, as the posi 
tion to which Hampson assigns the species in the Romanoff 
Memoirs implies that such is the case. 

Two small specimens from Mr. T. D. A. Cockerell from 
Mesilla Park, New Mexico, emerged August 4 and n. They 
are labeled as follows :

Honera luteella Hulst, Bull. 52, U. S. Nat. Mus., p. 433, 1902. 

Hulst's type of luteella is before me and agrees with Ragonot's 
figure of lithosella. The species does not belong to Honora, 
having S veins in the hind wings, but agrees generically with 
the European argyrella Fab., the type of Selagia. 

Cacotherapia, n. gen. 

Fore wings with 12 veins, 2 well before the angle of the cell, 3 before 
the angle, 4 and 5 long-stalked, cell long, 6 well below the upper angle, 
7 to 10 stalked, 7 to 9 close together on a long stalk, 7 from 8 beyond 9, 
10 shortly stalked, n from cell. Hind wings with 7 veins, 2 from long 
before angle of cell, 3 and 4 separate, 6 from upper angle of cell, 7 and 8 
anastomosing, the upper vein of the cell obsolete, resembling the discal 
vein. Labial palpi long, porrect ; maxillary palpi and tongue invisible ; 
rf antennae thickened, slightly dentate, ciliate, a heavy scaling on costa of 
fore wings below at base. 

Belongs to the Galleriinas near Antipilotis Meyrick, but differs 
in the obsolescence of the tongue, the long porrect palpi, etc.

Bigelovia douglassii, American Fork, Utah (E. A. Schwarz).

NOTES ON NORTH AMERICAN ARADID^E, WITH DESCRIP 
TIONS OF TWO NEW SPECIES. 

By OTTO HEIDEMANN. 

Dr. A. D. Hopkins, who is in charge of the forest insect inves 
tigations of the Department of Agriculture, turned over to me for 
identification a lot of hemipterous insects belonging to the family 
Aradidae. Some of these were collected by him on his trips to 
Florida and Texas, but the greater part of them by his assistant, 
Mr. W. F. Fiske, in North Carolina and Georgia during the year 
1903. The collection represents four genera with thirteen well- 
known species. In addition there are two new species of the 
genera Neuroctenus and Aneurus.* 



Subfamily 

Aradus acutus Say. 

Two specimens. A female taken at Tryon, N. C., April 17, 
1903, beneath the bark of a rotten oak log; and a male, found at 
Everett, Ga., April 27, 1903, under dry bark of small dead oak. 

On these specimens the cinereous spots on the dorsal part of 
abdomen show* very distinctly. The species is not uncommon, 
frequently being found also around Washington, D. C. 

Aradus similis Say. 

Two specimens from Tryon, N. C., December 14 and April 
9, 1903, beneath bark of elm, girdled last spring; also under 
bark of dead maple. This common species varies considerably 
in size. Even dwarf specimens are found. 

Aradus crenatus Say. 

Six specimens, males and females. All came from Tryon, 
N. C.. April 4, 7, 17, 1903. Found beneath bark of tulip trees 
(Liriodcndrori}* killed last summer ; under loose bark of hickory 
(log dead one year), and beneath bark of maple trees, girdled 
one year. I once took at Cabin John, Md., numerous specimens 
of nymphs and adults, by sifting the decaying wood of an old 
tree stump. 

Aradus niger Stal. 

Three specimens, male and female, winged form. They were 
collected by Dr. A. D. Hopkins, at Kirbyville, Texas, November 
17, 1902, under dead bark of long-leaf pine (Pinus palustris). 
This species was for a long time unrecognized, but specimens 

*The notes on mode of occurrence are mostly taken from field notes 
furnished me by Dr. A. D. Hopkins. 



162 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

have lately been compared with Stal's type by Dr. Ch. Aurivilius 
of Stockholm, and are now preserved in the U. S. National Mu 
seum collection.* 

Aradus cinnamomeus Panzer. 

One specimen, a winged male from Tryon, N. C. Common 
throughout the spring and early summer on a large pine tree, 
which had been .girdled in March, but which was still alive. 
Many specimens were caught in the pitch that exuded from the 
wound. This small Aradus belongs also to the palearctic fauna. 

Aradus fallen! Stal. 

A single female specimen, taken at light, May 30, 1903, at 
Tryon. N. C. This species has a wide range of distribution. 
Originally described from Rio Janeiro, Brazil, it occurs through 
out South America, in Mexico and the West Indies, and has 
recently been recorded from nearly all of the Southern States. It 
is known, also, from Indian Territory and the District of Colum 
bia. 

Aradus breviatus Bergroth. 

One example, a male, collected by Dr. A. D. Hopkins, on 
Taxodium at Baldwin, Fla. This species seems quite rare. I 
once took two specimens from the crevices of the bark of a living 
pine tree in the neighborhood of Washington, D. C. 



Subfamily 

Brachyrrhynchus granulatus Say. 

Numerous specimens from Tryon, N. C. , March 6 and April 
9, 1903 ; found on yellow pine trees, dead some years, and be 
neath bark of dead maples ; on fresh pine boards, attracted with 
other insects by the odor of resin; and on November 17, 1903, 
beneath bark of chestnut felled last spring. It was also taken at 
Savannah, Ga., April 29, and at Cornelia, Ga., November 22, 
1903, beneath dead and dry oak bark. The species is very abun 
dant throughout the United States. 

Neuroctenus simplex Uhler. 

Many specimens, mostly from Tryon, N. C., March 9, Novem 
ber 17, 18, 1903, beneath bark of decaying oak log and beneath 
bark of oak, which died last summer. The species was also col 
lected at Saluda, N. C., November 25, 1903, in large numbers 
beneath bark of oak trees girdled last spring ; and at Lakeland, 
Fla., April 7, 1904, on live-oak. This is the commonest species 
of the Aradids known in the United States. Fresh specimens

Netiroctenus pseudonymus Bergroth, Wien Ent. Zeit., xvm, p. 27, 1898. 

One example, taken at Saluda, N. C., May 20, beneath bark 
of a decaying chestnut log. This species was originally described 
from North Carolina. I have taken it twice in the District of 
Columbia. It is more robust and broader in body than any other 
of the North American species of Neuroctenus. 

Neuroctenus elongatus Osborn. 
Neuroctenus elongatus Osborn, Ohio Naturalist, iv, No. 2. p. 21, 1903. 

Six specimens, males and females, found at Tr-yon, N. C., 
April 3, 1903, beneath bark of decaying chestnut log. Prof. 
Herbert Osborn kindly examined one of the male specimens and 
identified it as N. elongatus, recently described by him from one 
male specimen in his paper on Aradidae of Ohio.* Having now 
a series of specimens of both sexes, I give the following descrip 
tion of the female : 

9- Anterior process of head reaching very slightly over the apex of 
first antennal joint; process of the antenniferous tubercles acute ; tubercles 
behind the eves quite prominent. Pronottim twice as wide as its length; 
posterior margin nearly straight. Dorsal part of abdomen dark brown, 
with the lateral margin reddish brown, the posterior edges of the segments 
on the connexivum a little raised near the incisures. Lateral lobes of the 
genital segment, as seen from above, slightly longer than the middle lobe, 
which is obtusely rounded and not broader than the lateral lobes. Length 
5.5 to 6 mm. ; width 2.25 mm. 

Of this species I possess also two examples from Greensburg, 
Pennsylvania. 

Neuroctenus hopkinsi, n. sp. 

Dark brownish, irregularly granulated. Anterior process of head deeply 
notched at tip, reaching the apex of the basal antennal joint; process 
of the antenniferous tubercles verv acute, divaricate; post-ocular part 
of head rounded, coarsely granulated, not tuberculated laterally. An 
tennae as long as the posterior margin of pronotum, finely granulated ; the 
basal joint stout, third joint somewhat more. slender than the others and 
slightly longer, the fourth fusiform and yellowish at tip with a few 
long, fine hairs. Pronotum trapezoidal ; the lateral margins slightly 
sinuated with the anterior angles rounded, somewhat prominent; poster 
ior margin straight; surface coarsely granulated, a little raised at the an-

terior part with two small, glabrous spots near the anterior border. 
Scutellum broad triangular, rounded at tip with a faint indication of a 
carina; near the pronotal border is a shallow impression, where the 
granules are indistinct, arranged in longitudinal rows, while the posterior 
part of the scutellum is very coarsely transversely wrinkled. Corium 
more finely irregularly granulated and rugulose ; the neuration of the 
membranous part of elytra very distinct; color black with two yellow 
spots at base near the scutellum. and one on each side next to the tip of 
corium. The lateral lobes of the female genitalia are rounded and exactly 
in the same line with the middle lobe, which is transverse and only a little 
broader than the lateral lobes. Male genital segment broad, oval, poster 
ior margin more angulate and the lateral lobes very small. 

Length of female 5.8 to 6.2 mm. ; width of abdomen 2.8 mm. 

Length of male 5.8 mm. ; width 2.6 mm. 

Hendersonville, N. C., May 26, 1903, found under bark of 
white pine, cut last winter. 

. No. 8048, U. S. National Museum. 



This species is easily distinguished from N. simplex Uhler and 
from N. elongatus Osborn by the conspicuously rugose surface 
of the posterior part of the scutellum and bv the differently 
shaped, slightly longer terminal genital segment of the male. It 
seems to be also allied to JV. amplus Champion and JV. punctu- 
latus Burmeister, but differs from the former in having the post- 
ocular part of -head not spinous nor tuberculate, and is distin 
guished from the latter species by the shorter antennae. 

I name the species in honor of Dr. A D. Hopkins, who has 
contributed much to our knowledge of the hemipterous insects 
living under bark of trees. 

Aneurus minutus Bergroth. 

Atieurus minutus Bergroth, Verh. Zool.-bot. Ges Wien, 1886, p. 58. 

Two specimens, male and female, from Brunswick, Ga., April 
26, 1903 ; found in deserted galleries of a small Cerambycid in dead 
branches of sumac. This species is recorded from Mexico and 
the West Indies. I have also seen specimens from Arizona and 
Southern Florida. 

Aneurus simplex Uhler. 

One example, a male, from Hoquiam, Washington State. This 
species has more slender antennae than any other of the species, 
and the apical joint is very long. The original specimen is re 
corded by Prof. Ph. R. Uhler from New England. 

Aneurus fiskei, n. sp. 

Reddish brown; finely granulate and rugulose. Head slightly longer 
than broad; front reaching to the middle of first antennal joint, spines of

the antenniferous tubercles acute and curved ; part behind the eyes ob 
tusely rounded, edged with a few fine granules; tubercles laterally obso 
lete. Antennae not quite twice the length of head ; basal joint very stout, 
broader than the frontal part of head; second joint oval like the basal 
one, but much smaller and not thicker than the two remaining joints, 
which are cylindrically formed; third joint nearly equal in length to the 
first; the terminal one a little longer than the third and second together, 
covered with fine hairs. Pronotum half as long as wide with a transverse 
furrow before the middle; the lateral margins anteriorly slightly sinuate; 
surface very finely granulate, posteriorly rugulose. Scutellum nearly as 
long as broad, having also the same length as the pronotum in the mid 
dle, more coarsely granulated with a short, faint carina anteriorly. The 
membranous part of elytra rugose and densely granulated, color black; 
near the middle of corium runs a transverse, yellowish spot, in some 
specimens obliterated. The terminal genital segment of male convex and 
long, but extending barely beyond the genital lobes. 

Length of female 3.8 to 4 mm. ; width i.S mm. 

Length of male 3.6 to 3.8 mm. ; width 1.6 mm.

Heidemann) , and Mount Airy, Ga., September 2, 1894 (E. A. 
Schwarz). Mr. Fiske's specimens were collected beneath bark 
of decaying branches of sour-wood (Oxydendrum} and also be 
neath loose bark scales on dry branches of sycamore. The other 
material was found on dry and decaying branches of trees. 

7ype.-^No. 8049, U. S. National Museum. 

This species has some similarity to A. montanus Champion, 
chiefly in the shape of the antennae, but differs in being smaller 
and having the post-ocular part of head not spinous. I take 
pleasure in dedicating it to Mr. W. F. Fiske. 



Mr. Heidemann stated, in this connection, that Prof. Herbert 
Osborn has in preparation a monograph of the Aradidae, Dr. 
Hopkins asked Mr. Heidemann what constitutes the food of 
Aradids. Mr. Heidemann stated that, so far as known, Aradidae 
appear to feed upon fungi. Dr. Hopkins said that this, also, was 
his opinion as to their food habits and he did not believe them 
insectivorous.* Dr. Ashmead stated that certain Proctotrypid 
parasites belonging to the genus Aradophagus infest the eggs of 
Aradida3.

The following paper by Mr. Coquillett was read by title : 

NEW NORTH AMERICAN DIPTERA. 
By D. W. COQUILLETT. 

At various times in the past few years, in the course of identi 
fying specimens of Diptera for various correspondents, the writer 
has given manuscript names to new species, at the request of the 
senders, and as several of these names have since appeared in print, 
while others are shortly to be published, it is desirable to have 
these species characterized so as to give the names a standing. 
Accordingly the descriptions are appended herewith, together 
with those of several other species which are as yet apparently 
undescribed : 

Family CHIRONOMID^. 

Ceratopogon medius, n. sp. 

Near varicolor, but differs in the coloring of the legs, the presence of 
black bristles on the hind tibiae, etc. Black, the face, mouth parts, joints 
two to seven of the antennae, the halteres, abdomen, tarsi except the nar 
row apices of the joints, a ring before apex of each front femur and both 
ends of the front and middle tibiae except their extreme apices, yellow. 
Eyes narrowly separated on the front. Thorax bluish gray pruinose. 
Front femora slightly thickened, each bearing four black spines on the 
under side, other femora without spines, first tarsal joint nearly twice as 
long as the second, the fourth joint dilated, bilobed at the apex, less than 
one-half as long as the fifth, the latter without spines on the under side, 
the two claws of each tarsus subequal in size. Wings bare, whitish hya 
line, third vein separated from the first, not connected bv a cross-vein, 
reaching three-fourths length of wing, apex of first vein a short distance 
before middle of the third, fourth vein forks almost opposite the small 
cross-vein. Length 2 mm.

segments two to seven, venter black scaled and with a broad fascia of 
whitish ones on the base of each segment. Legs black scaled, femora 
with a stripe of yellow ones toward the base of the posterior side, a few 
on the front side toward the base, a ring of whitish scales at three-fourths 
the length of the femora, scales at extreme apices of femora and bases of 
tibiae whitish, tibiae also with a narrow streak of whitish ones extending 
nearly the entire length of the posterior side, a broad band of whitish

The genus Stenopogon was founded by Loew as a section of 
the old genus Dasypogon* He gave a rather extended descrip 
tion of it under the caption " 3te Gruppe des Das. sabaudus. 
Stenopogon" and treated of six European species, of which 
sabaudus is the sixth and last. It is evident from his heading, 
quoted above, that Loew considered this latter species as being 
the type of this group or genus, and it should therefore be ac 
cepted as such. 

In July, 1866, Loew established a closely related genus under 
the name of Scleropogon f for a new species from California 
which he named picticornis ; he stated that this genus resembles 
Stenopogon in several particulars, but differs in the narrower 
face and front, shorter third antennal joint, longer style, also in 
having the first posterior cell closed before the margin of the 
wing and the third posterior cell greatly dilated all of them rel 
ative characters which are seldom alike in any two species, and 
many of the characters mentioned are found to vary considerably 
in the different specimens of the same species. 

A recent comparison of specimens which I identified as picti 
cornis, with Italian specimens of sabaudus received from Prof. 
M. Bezzi resulted in the firm conviction that the most pronounced 
difference existing between them is to be found in the nature of 
the hypopleura which is bare in sabaudus, but nearly covered 
with bristles and hairs in picticornis. Wishing to ascertain if 
Loew's type of picticornis was identical in this respect with the 
specimens I had referred to this species I applied to Mr. Samuel 
Henshaw, the Curator of the Museum of Comparative Zoologv 
at Cambridge, Mass., who. under date of May 17, 1904, wrote 
as follows: "Loew's type of Scleropogon picticornis has a

cluster of bristles and hairs in front of the halteres " that is, on 
the hypopleura, agreeing in this respect with my specimens. 

An examination of a large series of North American specimens 
belonging to nineteen different species in these two genera shows 
that this character is equally marked in all of them, the hypo- 
pleura being either quite bare, or else nearly covered with bristles 
and hairs ; it will therefore be advisable to employ this character 
in separating these two genera in place of the variable and unsat 
isfactory characters taken from the antennae and wings which 
have heretofore been employed for this purpose.

Dr. Dimmock writes that the Amblycorypha was collected on 
August 19, 1897, by Miss Annie G. Edwards, who brought it to 
him the same day. It appeared to be sickly, and in the evening 
two larvae issued from its abdomen and soon pupated, and the 
specimen of Sarcophaga, described above, emerged on Septem 
ber n of the same year.

The iSSth regular meeting was held at the Saengerbimd Hall, 
314 C street, N.W. In the absence .of the President and both 
Vice-Presidents, Dr. Ashmead was called to the chair. Present : 
Messrs. Benton, Currie, Knab, Kotinsky, Patten and Ulke. 

It was moved and seconded that two delegates be appointed to 
represent the Society at the International Geographic Congress 
to convene in Washington in .September.* 

Mr. C. L. Pollard was transferred from the jiist of active mem 
bers to that of corresponding members, to date from January i, 
1904. 

Mr. Knab, for Mr. Caudell, exhibited four specimens, two 
cTc? and two 9 ? , of the grasshopper Rhadinotatum brevipenne 
Thomas, showing ,the color variation to which this species is 
subject. The specimens were collected at Macon, Georgia, by 
Mr. Kotinsky. One of the 9 $ js wholly brown, the other has 
the posterior femora and the sides of the elytia, prothorax and 
head green, while both <$$ are grass-green on the dorsal sur 
face of the head, prothorax and elytra. The species has not 
before been recorded outside of Florida, although mentioned in 
Thomas' paper on " Insects Collected West of the ipoth Meri- 

* Dr. Theo. Gill and Mr. Frank Benton were subsequently appointed 
by the President.

dian," to note that it should be removed to another genus from 
Tryxalis the one in which it was described. In characterizing 
the genus Rhadinotatum, McNeill states that the posterior tibia 
has about 25 spines on the outer margin, and this has since been 
used as a synoptic character by Scudder and Bruner. Mr. 
Caudell had examined fifteen specimens, including the types, 
and found the usual number to be about 18, the greatest number 
found being only 21. 

Dr. Ashmead remarked that Rhadinotatum belongs io a group 
which is less abundant in the North than in the South. He had 
found similar forms in Florida and always in low-lying grassy 
land. Mr. Kotinsky stated that his specimens were likewise 
found in low grassy land. He said that the insects depended upon 
protective coloration for concealment, and if one observed care 
fully the spot where they alighted on the grass blades they could 
readily be picked up with the fingers. 

Mr. Knab further noted for Mr. Caudell that Dr. Howard 
had collected a <$ of Trimerotropis filosa McNeill, in Mexico. 
The species was described from California and this is the first 
record of it since its description. 

Dr. Ashmead reported the receipt of two more sendings of 
Philippine Hymenoptera from Manila, one from Father W. A. 
Stanton and the other from Father Robert Brown. The new 
forms contained in these sendings will increase the list of species 
additional to those already recorded as occurring in the Philip 
pines to 43.* He mentioned several of these among them a 
little Entedonid belonging to the genus Closterocerzis of West- 
wood. Mr. Ashmead said he considered it remarkable that 
Father Stanton had found so many species, and new ones at that, 
since all his collections had been made in the gardens of the ob 
servatory in Manila. It indicated, however, what a vast num 
ber of undiscovered species there must be in the Philippine 
Islands and what a wealth of material might be secured from a 
thorough collecting exploration of the surrounding country. 

Mr. Kotinsky stated that during the summer of 1903 six or 
eight colonies of the Asiatic ladybird ( Chilocorus similis Rossi) 
were introduced by the Department of Agriculture into various 

*InJourn. N. Y. Ent- Soc f , xn, No. i, pp. 1-22, March, 1904. 



OF WASHINGTON. 195 

parts of Georgia. Upon going again to Georgia this past spring 
he had visited four or five of these colonies, and in only two had 
a favorable increase in the number of individuals been made. A 
colony established at Marshallville contained a year ago 40,000 
beetles, but this spring there were none to be found. This Mr. 
Kotinsky attributed to the fact that the part of the orchard con 
taining the beetles had been sprayed with lime, salt, and sulphur 
wash, and that this had killed them. A colony had accidentally 
established itself in an adjoining orchard, but owing to improper 
care, it was weak in numbers this spring. 

The' immense colony of what afterward turned out to be C. 
bivulnerus, found in a section of plum trees in this same orchard 
feeding upon Pulvinaria amygdali Cockerel 1, with which these 
trees were badly infested, was at first mistaken for the imported 
beetle, owing to the large numbers of pupae found congregated 
together. 

Taking it all in all, it may be said that owing to improper care 
of the various colonies established in Georgia due to ignorance 
of the habits of the beetle on the part of the orchard managers 
none of the colonies was in a very thriving condition. Mr. 
Kotinsky said he suggested to these managers to collect and trans 
fer a colony of the beetles, each summer, to a section of the 
orchard they did not expect to spray the following year since 
he was informed that no orchard is entirely sprayed each year. 

Mr. Kotinsky ventured the supposition that possibly the colony 
on plum trees, referred to above, might be a cross of the two 
species (Chilocorus bivulnerus and C. similis}, retaining the 
structural characters of bivulnerus and the prolific breeding of 
similis. 

In conclusion, he observed that in shipping the ladybirds alive 
precautions must be taken that there is not, in the shipping cases, 
sufficient ventilation to cause a drying up of the enclosed twigs, 
since these beetles suffer much more from lack of moisture than 
from lack of food. All possibility of the rattling of the enclosed 
twigs must be avoided, also, and this, it seems, can only be ac 
complished by tacking the twigs to the box in which they are 
packed, for some evaporation will take place under all circum 
stances and this will cause the twigs to contract so as to become 
loosened. 



196 ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

Referring to Mr. Kotinsky's suggestion that the colony of 
beetles found on plum trees might be a cross between Chiloco- 
r2is bivulnerus and C. similis, Mr. Ulke stated that there has 
yet been no authentic record of hybridization or crossing among 
beetles. Dr. Ashmead said he had found Chilocorus bivulnerus 
extremely abundant on Lecanium on orange in Florida, and also 
on oak, and that he had observed strings of pupse on the Spanish 
moss, showing that this species is sometimes a prolific breeder 
and has the habit of congregating in numbers for pupation. 

Mr. Benton exhibited a beehive to show the ingenious method 
by which certain varieties of honey bees protect their hives from 
the entrance of insect enemies. These defenses consist of a row 
of stout, columnar pillars, made of gnawings of wax mixed with 
propolis and built in the hive entrance. They were made by 
some bees recently imported from the Island of Cyprus. Mr. 
Benton pointed out that all Oriental races of honey bees, in con 
tradistinction to those of Europe, construct th'ese defenses, which 
serve to prevent the entrance of the death's-head moth (Sphinx 
utropos] and the Oriental wasp ( Vespa orientalis], two insects 
which are injurious to honey bees in the Orient, the former by 
occasionally robbing them of their honey and the latter by prey 
ing upon the bees themselves. When imported into this country, 
where they are free from these two insect enemies, the bees keep 
up the habit of building these defenses for two or three seasons 
only, and then abandon it. The Carniolan, Austrian, and Ger 
man bees do not make the defenses, either in this country or in 
their home in Europe. Mr. Benton referred, in this connection, 
to the curious defenses made by the stingless honey bees (Mcli- 
pona and Trigona} and which formed the subject of a paper 
presented by him some years ago before the Society.* In that 
paper he had alluded also to the entrance defenses made by cer 
tain varieties of Apis in ell if era. 

Mr. Currie read extracts from letters received from Mr. 
Schwarz at Cayamas, Cuba, and Mr. Barber, at Brownsville, 
Texas, describing entomological conditions in those localities. 
Mr. Schwarz mentioned in his letter having secured at Cardenas,

through the kindness of a friend of Mr. Eduardo Ferrer, a speci 
men of the genuine Jejen ( (Eca eta fur ens Poey), the Chirono- 
mid which is such a pest at that locality, and which has much 
the same habits as our sandflies in the United States. Mr. 
Schwarz stated in his letter that certain Cuban birds feed upon 
the cotton boll weevil in Cuba and are instrumental in diminishing 
its numbers.

NOTES ON THE SYRPHID FLY PIPIZA RADICUM WALSH 

AND RILEY. 

By D. W. Coquiu.ETT. 

This species was originally described from a female specimen 
bred May 23, 1868, by B. D. Walsh, from a larva found feeding 
upon Schizofacura lanigerd in November, 1867, at Duquoin, 
Illinois.* In his " Bibliography of the writings of Walsh and 
Riley, "t Mr. Samuel Henshaw indicated that this specimen is 
in Washington, D. C., but this was evidently an error on the 
part of his informant, since no trace ot" it can be found either in 
the National Museum or among the insects in the collection of 
the U. S. Department of Agriculture. As this specimen was 
bred by Walsh it in all probability formed a part of his collec 
tion which was destroyed by fire in Chicago. 

In the ISfauonal Museum collection is a female specimen of a 
Pipiza, labeled as having also been bred from a larva found 
preying upon Schizoneura lanigcra, presumably at Washing 
ton, D. C., the date of emerging being given as April 6, 1879; 
it bears the note-book number 57, but the particular note-book 
which refers to it does not at present appear to be in the posses 
sion o|, either the Department of Agriculture or of the National 
Museum. Judging by the data attached to this specimen, it is 
, one of those referred to by Prof. J. t^. Comstock in his annual 
report as Government entomologist for the year 1879, where the 
species is called fct The root louse syrphus fly, presumably the 
Pipiza radicum of Walsh and Riley."* The present specimen 
agrees well with the original description of this species, and, hav 
ing similar habits, is without much doubt identical with it. 

Osten, Sacken wrongly credited this species to Riley, and made 
the .statement that it' is "apparently the same as femoralis 
'Loevy." Why it' was so considered is not apparent, since there 
is no mention \}\ the original description of the yellow cross-band 
'on the second abdominal segment, which is such a conspicuous 
feature in the last-named species. Dr. Williston placed it, with 
,a query, as a. synonym Q^ femoralis\ without making any com 
ment thereon ; he. also wrongly credited it to Riley. 

A recent comparison of the original description of radicum 
with those of the other species occurring in our fauna showed a

close agreement with only one of them, that of plstica Willis- 
ton, and the two specimens upon which the latter is based, which 
are now in the National Museum, agree well with this descrip 
tion as also with the specimen referred to above as having been 
bred from Schizoneura lanigcra. Thus the synonymy of pis- 
tica with radicum is quite certain, and the species should, there 
fore, be known henceforth as Pipiza radicum Walsh and Riley, 
which is the older name. 



The following paper by Mr. Banks was read by title : 

A LIST OF NEUROPTEROID INSECTS, EXCLUSIVE OF ODO- 
NATA, FROM THE VICINITY OF WASHINGTON, D. C. 

By NAJTHAN BANKS. 

The vicinity of Washington is well suited to many Neuropte- 
roid insects, but the Trichoptera are not nearly as abundant as 
in the mountainous regions to the north. The Psocidse are par 
ticularly numerous here, both in species, and in individuals. 

This fauna has, of course, not been fully explored, but such a 
considerable showing is made in the following list that it is 
thought desirable to publish in the hope of stimulating others to 
collect in this group. In all, 174 species are recorded, distrib 
uted as follows: Archiptera 73, Neuroptera 47, Trichoptera 54. 
The leading family, in point of numbers, is the Psocida3, with 31 
species ; two families, the Termitidas and AscalaphidaB, are each 
represented by but one species. 

In Virginia a few southern forms are found, and in the Poto 
mac valley there is a southward extension of many northern 
species. As a whole, however, the fauna is like that of the east 
ern coast States. 

Compared with the Neuropteroid fauna of the arid southwest 
there are very radical differences. I do not think there are more 
than a half a dozen species common to this list and the lists of 
Arizona and New Mexico which I have recently published. 

The types of the new species are in the author's collection. 

Order AROHIPTERA. 

Suborder ISOPTERA. 
Family TERMITID^. 
Termes flavipes Kollar.

Protoptila, n. gen. 

Spurs 0-4-4. Last joint of maxillary palpus (Plate II, Fig. 13) simple. 
Fore wings rather slender and nearly acute at tip, without erect hair, ex

Type: I3crcea? maculata Hagen. 

I place this genus in the Hydroptilidse although there are few 
erect hairs and there are four spurs on middle * tibiae ; yet the 
structure of the hind wing and the 'palpi place it there without 
doubt. 
Protoptila maculata Hagen.

Oxyethira dorsalis, n. sp. 

When at rest it is blackish, with a median dorsal white stripe formed by 
the white hairs of head, middle of thorax, the basal part of hind margin 
of fore wings, and the white fringe of hind margin. The antennae are 
white, with a few dark spots before tip, the vertex with two rosettes of 
white hair; the thorax has white hair on the middle, dark on the sides; 
the fore wings are clothed with dark brown hair, with the apex and the 
basal part of radius jet black; before the middle there is a white spot on 
each margin, sometimes apparently connected, beyond these is a white 
patch in the middle of wing, and farther out are two white patches on 
each margin, the last just before the black upturned tip. The fringe of 
the fore wing is rather long on the costal margin, and before tip it is 
much longer than the width of the wing at that point ; the fringe of hind 
margin is much longer, especially toward tip. The hind wings are gray, 
with darker veins, and dark costal fringe, the gray hind fringe more than 
three times as long as width of wing. The fore wings are very slender, 
the costal margin before the tip is slightly concave, the tip almost sharp; 
the hind wings are very slender, acuminate, the costal margin near base 
swollen. Legs yellowish ; spurs 1-3-4; hind tibiae with long fringe, true 
hind spurs also very long. Length 3 mm. 

Many specimens from Washington, D. C., Falls Church, Va., 
and Plummer's Island, Md. ; June to September. 

This species is separated from Orthotrichia americana, which 
it superficially resembles, by the fact that the costal fringe of fore 
wings near tip is longer than the width of the wings at that place, 
while in the latter species the fringe is barely longer than else 
where along the costal margin.

THE EGG AND YOUNG LARVA OF CULEX PERTURBANS 

WALKER. 

By HARRISON G. DYAR AND ROLLA P. CURRIK. 

Among the mosquitoes which have been found to occur more 
or less commonly on Plummer's Island, Maryland, the headquar 
ters of the Washington Biologists' Field Club, is this large and 
easily recognized ring-legged species. Four adult specimens 
were captured there on -August 23 of the past summer by one of 
the writers (Mr. Currie), but were not preserved alive. They 
were determined by Mr. D. W. Coquillett who mentioned the 
desirability of obtaining living examples in order, if possible, to 
secure eggs and larvae therefrom. 

Accordingly Mr. Currie made another trip to the island on the 
afternoon of August 25, remaining there till the following morn 
ing. This trip resulted in the capture, alive, of three adult 9 9 
which came to bite, one in the house about nine o'clock that 
evening at a lighted table and the other two on the porch about 
5.30 in the morning. The first specimen, to be alluded to as 
" No. i," was by mistake caught in a cyanide vial, but when re 
cognized as perturbans was quickly removed. It recovered in 
a very few minutes and was permitted to bite, which it did with 
out hesitation when the captor's arm was placed over the mouth 
of the bottle in which it was confined. Of the other two speci 
mens, one (No. 2) was already gorged with blood when captured, 
and the other (No. 3) was allowed to bite the hand a few hours 
later, an opportunity of which it eagerly availed itself. 

Each mosquito was placed in a wide-mouth bottle, one-half to 
two-thirds full of water, taken from a rain-water barrel in which 
Culex pipiens and associated species were breeding in numbers. 
The water was, of course, carefully strained before using to ex 
clude all pipiens and other larvae. 

On the second of September mosquito No. 2 was resting on 
the surface of the water as if preparing to deposit eggs. The 
following morning it was still in this position, but no eggs had 
been laid. Jn the bottle with No. 3, however, and floating 
upon the water, was a boat-shaped mass of eggs of a pale 
whitish color. Very shortly the eggs began to turn dark and 
before noon were brown-black. 

No further observations were made until September 6, at 
which time the eggs were still unhatched. Mosquitoes Nos. i 
and 2 were dead on the surface of the water. No eggs had 
been deposited by No. 2, but beside No. \ were a few irregu- 



OF WASHINGTON. 



219 



larly-placed eggs, appearing as if they had been laid^while the 
mosquito was in a weak or dying condition. 

Eggs of No. 3 were found hatched on the morning of the Sth, 
and a few of those laid by No. i hatched the morning of the 
loth. For the first few days the larvas were fairly active and 
wriggled in a leisurely fashion, although seldom coming to the 
surface. On one occasion, a few days after their hatching, they 
were noticed at the surface, but when disturbed did not soon 
return. Some of them lived for ten clays or longer, -but did not 
pass beyond the first stage and became more and more sluggish 
until their death. 

The egg-mass, egg and larva may be described as follows : 




FIG. 4. Larva of Culex perturbtins , first stage, and enlarged air-tube. 

Egg-mass. Floating on the surface of the water, boat-shaped, some 
what pointed at one end, broad and truncated at the other, widest near 
the middle;* containing about 150 eggs adhering loosely together and 
resting perpendicularly on the water on their larger end, thus making the 
mass narrower above than beneath. 

Egg. Resembling that of C. pipiens, narrowly conical, broad and flatly 
rounded at the micropylar end, narrow and bluntly pointed at the other. 
At first pale whitish in color, afterwards becoming brown-black. Surface 
covered with small granules of varying size, those at the small end largest 
and perceptibly denticulated. Length .8 mm., greatest width .2 mm. 



* It is altogether probable, of course, that different egg-masses laid by 
this species will be found to vary considerably, not only in shape but also 
in the number of eggs they contain.

Larva, stage I. Head elliptical, a little longer than wide, smooth, a 
distinct offset on each side bearing the antennae, which are very long, 
slender, a small hair at basal third, two smaller ones before tip and two 
terminal spines; two spines at the mouth; brushes very small and of few 
hairs; eves round, blackish; a small black button on the center of the 
upper surface with a clear space before it. All darkly infuscated except 
the basal insertion of the antennae, which are paler toward the tips. 
Thorax broader than long; abdomen submoniliform, normal. Thoracic 
hairs fine, not long, in groups on the sides as usual. Abdominal hairs 
moderate, the large lateral ones double on the first two segments, then 
single, less developed posteriorly. Comb of the 8th segment a single 
row of short, pointed spines. Air tube constricted at the outer third, the 
terminal portion linear and ending in a bunch of stout recurved hooks, 
the basal portion slightly constricted centrally, bearing a long hair on 
each side, but no pecten ; heavily infuscated to base. Anal segment longer 
than wide, an elongate dorsal plate, slightly infuscated; dorsal tufts of 
two hairs on each side, a smaller lateral hair, no ventral brush. Anal 
processes four, small, very slender, uniform with rounded tips, containing 
small tracheae. Body tracheae slender, uniform, nearly straight, trace 
able from head to air fube distinctly. Body transparent with many small 
yellow spots of pigment, irregularly scattered. 

This larva has hitherto escaped observation. It is the last one 
of the common Atlantic Coast forms to be discovered, and is 
really not discovered yet, since we are unaware of its natural 
habits and places of occurrence. The larvae refused to feed. 
They did not use the small mouth brushes perceptibly, but lay 
at the bottom of the water absolutely motionless for hours and 
days together. Some specimens we thought dead; but on trans 
ferring them to a slide, they wriggled in a fairly lively manner, 
pushing the curiously shaped air tube as if to fasten it in some 
object. This tube is obviously of a prehensile nature, being 
furnished with hooks like the cremaster of a moth pupa. It can 
scarcely serve to pierce the water film ; but whether the larvae 
live in hollow trees and attach themselves by the air tube to the 
soft wood within, or whether their life history is of an even more 
complex nature, we can only surmise at present. They do not 
seem active enough to be predaceous, and they are not ordinary 
vegetable feeders. If they are parasites, we cannot yet surmise 
in what manner, nor on what host.

A NEW TORTRICID FROM THE SEA SHORE. 

(Ancylis maritima, n. sp.) 

By HARRISON G. DYAR. 

While at Weekapaug, Rhode Island, last summer, I observed 
the leaves of the beach pea {Lathyrus maritima) to be much 
eaten by the larva of a small Tortricid. The leaves were spun 
together in pairs and the half of the leaf within eaten away to 
the outer epidermis, the frass being retained in the cavity. 
Larger leaves were folded over to form a similar cavity. The 
larvae were yellowish, without marks or other distinctive char 
acters. 

The moths were bred the same season, and proved to be a 
species of Ancylis unlike any known to me, for which I propose 
the name maritima, as it seems confined to the beach pea, which 
grows only in the shore sand. The moths resemble scmiovana 
Zeller, lundana Fabricius, and laclniana Zeller. The ground 
color is largely dull ochraceous, being white only at the edges of 
the dark markings. The basal oval dark patch has an irregular 
ity on its upper edge which, in some specimens, is resolved into 
a blackish dash. The median oblique costal band is brown, 
often darker on the costal part, the median portion becoming 
faint, its shape much as in Zeller's figure of angulifasciana. A 
series of white and brown bars at apex. The hind wings are 
blackish, with pale fringe. Expanse of wings 1012 mm. 

The types of Ancylis maritima are ten bred specimens, one 
of which is in the collection of Mr. W. D. Kearfott, the others 
in the National Museum, type No. 8140.

Among a collection of some thirty-five species of Phycitmse, 
made by Mr. W. F. Fiske at Tryon, North Carolina, last sum 
mer, is one which appears to be new, and which I \vould de 
scribe as follows : 
Lsetilia fiskeella, n. sp.

vein, 7 and 8 stalked, 8 rather weak, 10 and n from the cell ; hind wings 
with 7 veins, 2 shortly before angle of cell. 3 and 4 stalked, cell rather less 
than half the length of the wing. Palpi slender, second joint curved, as-

cending, third joint long, conical ; <$ antennae simple. Light gray with 
heavy black shades. Basal space darkly shaded to inner line, which is 
upright, flexuous or slightly dentate, pale, followed bv a broad black shade. 
Discal dots small, fused into a larger spot 'in one specimen. Outer line 
bent inward slightly on the folds, with black shades on both sides, the 
outer covering the terminal space. Hind wings dark with pale fringes.

A FEW NOTES ON THE HULST COLLECTION. 
By HARRISON G. DYAR. 

I have recently spent a few hours in looking over the Hulst 
collection, and have noted some points that seem worthy of rec 
ord. A full commentary on the synonymy of the Hulst types 
cannot be made without more extensive comparison of specimens. 

The collection is now placed in a small basement room in the 
Rutgers College library, where it has been carefully installed by 
Dr. J. B. Smith. I was told that the specimens stand as Dr. 
Hulst left them, having been simply transferred to drawers, and 
that there have been practically no additions made. This is most 
commendable. I hope that when additions are made they will 
be clearly marked so that they cannot be confounded with the 
original collection, the specimens of which should not be trans 
ferred or replaced. The collection is smaller than I had sup 
posed it to be and weak in the number of specimens of each 
species, there being no long series and most frequently only one 
or two specimens. It is, however, very rich in types. The 
specimens themselves are seldom in good condition, some of the 
types even being nearly unrecognizable. 

But the most surprising feature is the general condition of con 
fusion of the species. This is due to no accident, but must be 
attributed to the peculiarities of the founder of the collection. 
Dr. Hulst seems to have had absolutely no eye for specific indi 
viduality, placing the most incongruous forms under the same 
label. Even his types are in this condition and I believe that 
where he has more than one type of a species they are more often 
different than conspecific. For example, of the two types of 
Philereme tmiltivagata, one is Eustroma explanation. Under 
Caberodes majoraria Gn. are four specimens, one of which 
bears the red label " typical." The three are normal majoraria, 



OF WASHINGTON. 223 

but the one selected as being especially typical is a well defined 
specimen of Sabulodes caberata Gn. ! Under the label Petro- 
phora munitata Hiibn. are four specimens, two of which are 
Rheumaptera sociata Borkh., one J^Iesoleuca lacustrata Guen., 
and one Hydriomene latirtipta Walk. Under the label Seli- 
dosema umbrosarium are 23 specimens, arranged in three 
groups as if they had been sorted into subspecies, yet there are 
at least six good species among them, including such heterogen 
eous things as Melanolophia canadaria and Eucymatoge intes- 
tinata. Nor are these isolated cases. It is now fairly evident 
to me how Dr. Hulst could make such atrocious determinations 
as he has formerly made. Indeed I wonder that, with his col 
lection in such a condition, he could ever name anything cor 
rectly.

Eucymatoge grandis Hulst. 

The single type is Hydriomene basaliata Walk. The spe

rection should be made accordingly. 

Hydriomene curvilinea Hulst. 

This is the same as H. occidcns Hulst, the subbasal and outer 
transverse anterior lines being a little more distinct than in the 
type of occidcns. The name curvilinea has precedence, though 
it is an inappropriate and even misleading one.

Petrophora illocata Hulst. 

There are two types, one of which is P. glacialis Hulst, the 
other P. nemorella Hulst. P. glacialis may therefore be re 
ferred to illocata as a synonym, or nemorella may be so referred 
as you prefer. 

Mycterophora monticola Hulst. 

This is a Noctuid, but thin and broad-winged. I did not rec 
ognize the species when examining the collection, but have since 
selected one from Placer Co., California (Koebele), which I 
think is the species. It is smaller than Hulst's measurement, 
expanding but 26 mm., but agrees otherwise. It was formerly 
named by Dr. Hulst "Aspilates desperaria Hulst." 

Mycterophora longipalpata Hulst. 

This species is evidently correctly placed by me.* 
Mycterophora slossoniae Hulst. 

This is a large sized Homopyralis, but I did not venture to 
say what species without being able to make comparisons, and 
especially as the type is very poor. I think the gray costal band 
is an artifact. 

Eois anticaria Walk. 

Of two specimens so named, one from Colorado is my Cyma- 
tophora matilda; the other from California is like it but the 
lines are differently placed. There is no certainty that Hulst 
has correctly identified Walker's species in either specimen. 
Matilda is not an Eois in any case. 

Sciagraphia flavivenata Hulst. 

The single c^ type looks to me like a very fresh, brightly 
marked Orthojidonia exornata, with all the wings darkened 
and the veins yellow-lined. 

Macaria grassata Hulst 

This seems scarcely distinct from M. aquifcraria Walk. It 
is a little smaller, 

Cymatophora ella Hulst. 

The type is one 9 and looks like a common Dcilinia of the 
behrensaria group with all the markings obsolete. Bear this in 
mind when you think you have a new Dcilinia. 

Cymatophora festa Hulst. 

The single type is Deilinia pulveraria Hulst. The name 
festa has priority, but should be referred to Deilinia .

OF WASHINGTON. 225 

Diastictis speciosa Hulst. 

The 9 type is a Geometric!, but associated with it as the males 
are two specimens of the Noctuid Matigramma rubrosuffusa 
Grote, which has a slight superficial resemblance. 

Thallophaga fautaria Hulst. 

This is A nthelia nigroseriata Pack. Tetrads hyperborea 
Hulst (type in the National Museum) is likewise the same spe 
cies, which Packard figures very well. It is not a Deilinia as 
Hulst makes it,* but congeneric with Anthelia taylorata^\\\^. 
The " Deilinia nigroseriata " of the Hulst collection is Apcc- 
casia deductaria Walk., which Mr. Geo. VV. Taylor has iden 
tified for me. 

Deilinia perfalcata Hulst. 

The tw r o 9 types are Anthelia taylorata Hulst. (See above.) 
I am unaware that this name has been printed except in Smith's 
list of 1903, No. 3915. 

Caripeta ida Hulst. 

One 9 type, which I can match in a specimen from Beulah, 
New Mexico (T. D. A. & W. P. Cockerell). It is Deilinia 
behrensaria Hulst with the ground color reddish, the pale part 
of the outer line obsolete, but its outer black border continuous 
from costa to margin. 

Somatolophia umbripennis Hulst. 

The single 9 type is Aids haydenata Pack. Thus both genus 
and species fall. 
Tornos cinctarius Hulst. 

This seems entirely distinct from scolopadnarius Guen. , per 
haps even generically so. The type is a single 9 . 
Ixala desperaria Hulst. 

As an unusual circumstance, the type in the Hulst collection 
is conspecific with the one in the National Museum. This is 
the species which I have called (erroneously) Deilinia quadraria 
Grote. j- The reader will kindly make the correction in the two 
references indicated. Dr. Hulst's identification of D '. quadraria 
is the form which grades into D. carncaria Hulst and D. bifi- 
lata Hulst, \ an identification which I am not in a position to 
dispute. Quadraria, then, will fall in with the falcataria 
seiies, the earliest name for which appears to be ferruginosaria

ard) in Catopyrrha,* and I have a specimen like the one that 
stands in his collection under that label. It is very unlike Pack 
ard's figure of his original 9 type Qiferruginosaria^ being even 
larger than coloraria Fab., while Packard had a small, nearly 
unicolorous form. It may be called Catopyrrha hulstii, n. sp. 
It resembles Deilinia behrensaria Hulst (and was once so de 
termined for me by Dr. Hulst), but the two lines are upright and 
straight across the wing and there is a separate subterminal row 
of black dots. 

Selidosema correllatum Hulst. 

Two types, labelled " Macaria correllatum ," are both Scia- 
graphiagranitata Guen. There is a third type in the National 
Museum which is quite a different species, resembling Diastictis 
inquinaria Hulst, but smaller and otherwise different. There 
are also in another drawer two more types labelled Selidosema 
correllatum. They are not alike but may represent the species 
in the National Museum. My notes are not sufficient to settle 
the point. 

Under the label Sciagraphia granitata Guen., Hulst had 
eight specimens, three normal granitata, three S. dcnticulata 
Grote, one specimen labelled as Bates' type of sexpunctata and 
one Macaria cequifcraria Walk. Bates' sexpunctata, by the 
way, is, to judge from this type, neither denticulata Grote nor 
granitata Guen., but calif orniata Pack., or a form of that type. 
I was unable to compare it properly. 

Nacophora minima Hulst. 

The single 9 type resembles Gabriola dyari Taylor, but the 
white spot above anal angle is only a faint lighter cloud. It is 
probably the 9 of dyari. The type is from Colorado (Bruce). 
Mr. Taylor's generic name will hold. 

Jubarella danbyi Hulst. 

One type only. It is synonymous with Spodolepis substri- 
aria Hulst. Neither this nor the two tvpes of substriaria pos 
sess the discal marks, though they are distinct in some of. my 
specimens. The species flies from the Atlantic to the Pacific in 
the North and further south along the Rocky Mountains. 

Eugonobapta brunneolineata Hulst 

One type. I think this is only a very badly rubbed specimen 
of Ania limbaria Haw., that originally had very little purple. 
Euchlsena galbanaria Hulst. 

This is the same as E. falcata Pack.

Eutrapela perangulata Hulst. 

This is the same as E. alcipheraria Walk. 
Metanema incongruaria Hulst. 

This is not specifically distinct from M. quercivoraria Guen. 
Almodes terraria Guen. 

Specimens of this odd species are in the collection. Dr. Hulst* 
has redescribed it as Cleora pedicellata and Cleora subaustra- 
lis, the types being in the National Museum. They both have 
the antennae broken, otherwise their proper position would have 
been too obvious for even Dr. Hulst to mistake. 



Dioryctria bistriatella Hulst. 

The 9 type looks like a Myelois; but it is distinct from im- 
mundella Hulst, which is narrower winged and different. The 
synonymy given by Dr. Hulstf should be cancelled. 
Myelois elegantella Hulst. 

The 9 type is a synonym of Dioryctria abietella Schiff., not 
of Pinipestis albovittella Hulst as given. \ 
Pinipestis umbripennis Hulst 

The cT type suggests my Ortholcpis gillettella and may be 
the same species, though an actual comparison is needed. The 
species does not belong to Pinipestis as the tf antennae have 
only the normal basal tuft. 
Dioryctria brucei Hulst. 

The d* type is the same as Ambesa lallatalis Hulst, which is 
a ?. The species belongs neither to Dioryctria nor Ambesa, 
but falls in Tacoma. The cT antennae have a distinct tuft, 
though it is hollow from top view. The $ type of brucei is an 
other species which I did not stop to determine. 
Salebria delectella Hulst. 

The 9 type appears to be a Dioryctria from the pattern of 
the markings. 
Myelois aliculella Hulst 

There are two types and nine others, all alike. A twelfth 
specimen is different and is probably my Salebria fur ciferella. 
A mistake has been made in the generic location of aliculella. 
It cannot belong to Mvclois as the cT maxillary palpi are very 
distinctly pencil-tufted. It may be better referred to Salebria.

Etiella rubribasella Hulst. 

This seems only a small specimen of E. zinckenella Tr. 

Zophodia bella Hulst. 

The 9 type from Massachusetts is the same as the cT type of 
franconiella Hulst from New Hampshire. There are also five 
specimens from Colorado which differ a little from the eastern 
form, being more stone color, more contrasted and a trifle nar 
rower winged. 

Euzophera inornatella Hulst. 

The 9 type is Hnmoeosoma stypticellum Grote, as I have 
identified that form. Dr. Hulst's identification is different, but 
uncertain. Under the label stypticellum are four specimens, 
representing as many distinct species. One is marked tc typical " 
(New Hampshire) and has the bands broad, discal dot large, 
the rest of the wing nearly white. Inornatella is in the wrong 
genus in any case. 

Lsetilia hulstii Cockerell. 

The type is greasy and perfectly indeterminable, and i* a 9 as 
well. It is larger than coccidivora with the hind wings white. 
I do not believe that it is at all related to it. 

Palatka nymphseella Hulst. 

The type has no abdomen and no antennae, so the sex cannot 
be determined. Superficially it looks exactly like the European 
Heterographis oblitella Zell. 

Zophodia nigromaculella Hulst. 

There are nine specimens, all 9 9 and conspecific with Lceti- 
lia coccidivora Cornstock. The single palpus left, on the type 
is defectively porrected and is apparently the cause of the wrong 
generic reference. Dr. Hulst was fond of referring to the value 
of " structural characters." The present case points a moral. 

Statina gaudiella Hulst. 

The abdomen is gone and the sex is indeterminate. There is 
no tuft of scales at the base of the antennae, though they are bent. 
Perhaps it is rubbed off, since the published accounts mention this 
character. Fore wings with 10 veins, 3-4 and 8-9-10 stalked ; 
hind wings with 6 veins, 2 before the angle of the. cell. The 
species looks like Aurora^longipaJpella Rag., known only in the 
9, but that has 7 veins in the hind wing. I think that we must 
be prepared for variations in the venation of these little tongue- 
less Phycitines, and I shall not be surprised if gaudiella and 
longipalpella prove identical.

Wekiva nodosella Hulst ; Chipeta perlepidella Hulst ; 
Hypsotropha luteicostella Ragonot ; Calera puncti- 
lirnbella Ragonot. 

I am of the opinion that these four names should be united, as 
one species, to Peoria approximella Walker. The markings 
are identical in all. The differences on which these five genera 
rest are : whether the palpi are porrect or ascending; whether 
there are 6 or 7 veins in the hind wings and 9 or 10 in the fore 
wings. The palpi are movable and assume various angles after 
death. The under side of the second joint is straight, the upper 
side widened, giving the appearance of a slight downward curve. 
Ragonot's figure of Hypsotropha hiteicostella shows the second 
joint distinctly curved upward, and this may be distinct if the 
figure is correct. I have no specimens referred to it. Calera 
punctilimbella Rag. differs only in having 6 veins in the hind 
wings. This is a case of variation, I think, as I have specimens 
of approximella with the stalk of veins 3 and 4 of various 
lengths, some closely approaching coalescence. Hulst's type of 
Wekiva nodosella has now no palpi. It does not otherwise dif 
fer from approximella. The type of Chipeta perlepidella is 
supposed to differ in having but 9 veins in the fore wings. I 
could not find more than this number ; but the tips of both wings 
are so broken in the type that there is no certainty ; there may 
really have been ten. The genus and species are due either to 
an error or a case of variation, I believe.

Six specimens, $tf and 9 9 , and some larval forms, from 
Crescent City, Florida (collection Heidemann). These insects 
were found by Mr. H. G. Hubbard on bark of dead orange trees. 
Also one from Bayou Sara, La. (Schwarz). The specimens 
agree perfectly with Dr. Bergroth's brief, description in that they 
are distinct from the South American P. cinctipes Stal by hav 
ing the third joint of antennas longer than the second one. 
Bergroth's specimen came from Georgia. 

Proxius schwarzii, n. sp. 

Body elongate-oval, parts of head, thorax and scutellum excavated and 
raised. Color reddish brown and covered in some places with a \ellow- 
ish white incrustation. Head about as long as broad and formed neck- 
like at base ; postocular part of head tumidly margined, exteriorly, bluntly 
toothed, making the head broader there than in 
front; in the middle of the head is a longitudinal 
ridge, with a large hole at its broader end ; on 
both sides of this ridge opens a long, deep exca 
vation, extending even to the thorax, probably 
serving for the reception of the antennae; next 
to the eyes another but more shallow excava 
tion; tylus rounded, a little depressed, much 
shorter than the apical lobes of the head, which 
are sinuated at the sides and in front, the rounded 
tips converging inwardly ; antenniferous process 
strongly spined and curved interiorly, reaching to 
the middle of the first antennal joint; eyes con 
siderably small; basal joint of antennae stout, 
twisted outwardly and reaching a trifle over the 
tip of the apical lobes of the head ; second joint 
Oval, shorter than the first; third very thin, a 

little knobbed at the apex and about twice as long as the second; the 
terminal joint nearly as stout and long as the first, pilose at the tip. 
Thorax subquadrate ; lateral margins anteriorly strongly sinuated and 
excavated in front, posteriorly more straight, rounded off in short 
flaps at the humeri, which carry transversely a narrow ridge. At the 
angles of the anterior margin of thorax is an obtuse, somewhat exca 
vated strong spine, bending down behind the base of head ; the poster 
ior margin of thorax in the middle convexly rounded; at the disk of the 
thorax the incrustate part is moulded into a bilobed prominence, much 
elevated anteriorly, while down the middle of it runs an excavation which 
changes abruptly into an upright, blunt thorn, cut off at tip; the anterior 
and posterior lobes of the thorax are separated, a little behind the middle, 
by a transverse, deep furrow, bounded by a bisinuate ridge; behind this 
two incrustate spots. Scutellum formed somewhat shield-like; the sides 
thickly rimmed, more obsoletely at base; the apex triangularly incised ;

in the middle of the scutelluin a reversed _|_-like elevation. Head and the 
anterior lobe of thorax remote, deeply punctured ; posterior lobe and 
scutelluin somewhat granulated. Hemelytra shining and rather trans 
parent; the veins of the corium feebly marked; the inner margin bisinu- 
ate; base of membrane a little whitish. Abdomen one-third longer than 
broad ; narrower at base than before the apex and with the lateral mar 
gins slightly rounded towards the end of the fifth segment, the outer 
angle of which appears a little prominent; the last abdominal segment at 
the sides deeply sinuated, the apical part exteriorly rectangular, and 
acute, the apex of the segment transversely truncate. Ventral part of ab 
domen ornamentally incrustate; connexivum from above, at the incisures 
of the first and fifth segments only partly so; the sixth totally, and a few 
spots of incrustation on the inner margin of dorsal abdomen, next to the 
membrane. Genital lobes, seen from above, short, triangularly rounded; 
the middle lobe stouter and a trifle longer. Feet moderately thickened, 
finely granulated, light brownish, the femora dark brown towards the tip. 
Length 4.5 mm. ; width across abdomen 2 mm.

This interesting species comes nearest to Proxius gypsatus 
Bergroth,* found in Venezuela and Central America, but differs 
in the form and arrangement of the incrustate prominences and 
in having the peculiar form of the elevation on the middle of 
scutellum just reversed from that of Bergroth's species. I take 
pleasure in dedicating it to my friend Mr. E. A. Schwarz, to 
whom I am indebted for kind advice in my studies of the Hemip- 
tera. 

Aradus uniformis, n. sp. 

Body uniformly broad, comparatively short and very thin; color dull 
black, except the third joint of antennae and the edges of the abdominal 
segments adjoining the incisures of the connexivum above and below, 
which are yellowish white. Head, pronotum, and hemelytra more or less 
granulated in transverse rows, more strongly so on the lower part of scu 
tellum and finely and irregularly on the underside of the body. Head 
somewhat longer than broad across the eyes ; the apical process of head 
long and straight, reaching the second joint of antennas, the sides broad 
and compressed, the tip bluntly rounded off; antenniferous process of 
head prominent and very acute, reaching to the middle of the first anten- 
nal joint; eyes moderately large, strongly protruding from the sides of the 
head. Antennae about as long as the width of the posterior margin of

base, gradually increasing in thickness towards the tip, its length some 
what exceeding the two last joints taken together; third joint slightly 
longer than the terminal joint, which is fusiform. Rostrum not extend

as long in the middle, the lateral margins anteriorly recurved, the edges 
beset with minute teeth of which a few are larger at the anterior sides; 
posterior margin barely sinuated, behind the humeri not produced into 
rounded flaps; the disk of pronotum carries six longitudinal well defined 
carinate lines at equal distances, the outer ones much abbreviated, but the 
middle lines even touching the edge of the anterior margin ; the callosities 
only feebly marked. Scutellum twice as long as broad, the sides sharply 
elevated, at the middle slightly sinuate, and the disk tumidly raised near 
the base of .scutellum. Hemelytra comparatively long, tip of corium 
reaching the posterior part of the fourth abdominal segment; the costal

rounded ; the membrane extending to the end of the abdomen in the male ; 
in the female the genital lobes are exposed. Legs finely granulated, the 
inner sides of tibia; densely spinous. Genital lobes of the male broadly

This species bears some resemblance to Aradus lugitbris Fall., 
principally in the antennae, which are of nearly the same shape, 
although slightly thicker. But it differs from the latter in being 
a more robust and broader insect and in not having the lateral 
margins of pronotum sinuate. 

Aradus hubbardi, n. sp. 

Body elongate-oval ; color dark brown and partly cinnamon-brown ; in

straight, rounded off" at tip, reaching about one-third the length of the 
second antennal joint; antenniferous spines broad at base, very sharp! v

and forming sharp anterior angles beyond the eyes; posteriorly abruptly 
rounding into flaps, which are, in clear specimens, of a strikingly paler 
color than the other part of pronotum ; the edges armed with irregular 
teeth, which suddenly change into diminutive ones near the humeri ; 
disk of pronotum carrying the usual six longitudinal carinate lines, the 
inner ones nearing each other, the outer ones much abbreviated ; the cal 
losities very feebly defined. Scutellum tumidly elevated across the mid 
dle near the base, the sides slightly rounded and sharply edged, and pale 
at tip. Hemelytra moderately expanded near the base and narrowing 
considerably to\\wds the membrane; corium pale, darker between the 
cross-veins and blackish at base and apex. Abdomen of the female elon- 
gatel v-rounded, cinnamon-brown above and below, the outer margin of 
the connexivum darker, at the incisures pale, intermixed with patches of 
small red spots; the male has the abdomen more broadly rounded and 
darker in color, except the ventral part of the last two segments, which 
are -pale. The membrane reaches the fifth or base of the sixth abdominal 
segment; in the male the membrane extends to the end of the abdomen. 
Feet finely granulated and dark brown, the coxae and the tip of femora 
and tibiae paler. First genital segment of the female nearly half as long 
as the sixth abdominal segment; genital lobes broad, truncate at apex, 
the inner part pale. In the male there is across the middle of the sixth 
segment of the abdomen a narrow, reddish stripe. Length, 9 7 to S 5

This species ought to be placed next to A. similis Say, with 
which it has the most resemblance. It differs from that species, 
however, in the form of the thorax and especially in the shape of 
the female genital lobes. A. similis Say has the sides of the 
thorax more or less rounded, the surface flat, with the callosities 
prominent, and the female genital lobes decidedly emarginated. 
A. hubbardi is also related to A. debilis Uhl., from which it 
can be at once distinguished by the shorter and thicker antennas 
and in having the abdomen of the female less narrowed towards 
the apex. 

I have named this species in honor of the late Mr. H. G. Hub- 
bard, the eminent American entomologist, who has made valuable 
observations on the habits and life history of hemipterous insects, 
and by his extensive collections has added greatly to our know 
ledge of the Hemiptera fauna of the United States,

[The'following series of descriptions was included in a Synop 
sis of the North American Psyllidae prepared by myself, at the 
request of the late Dr. C. V. Riley, in the years 1886 and 1887, 
but which has never been published. With the accumulation of 
material collected of late years in various parts of the United 
States and now preserved in the collections of the U. S. Depart 
ment of Agriculture and the U. S. National Museum, the Synop 
sis has become greatly antiquated, but it is my intention to revise 
and publish certain portions thereof, as well as to rescue from 
oblivion some fine drawings made for the Synopsis by the late 
Dr. Geo. Marx. This is done by the kind permission of Dr. L.

1. NORTH AMERICAN SPECIES OF THE GENUS EUPHYLLURA 

FCERSTER. 

This genus belongs to the subfamily Aphalarinae Fr. Loew. 
and is very readily recognizable. The head has, in front of the 
anterior ocellus, two transverse lobes which are as wide as the 
vertex, contiguous throughout and, at their anterior edge, either 
conjointly truncate or slightly rounded separately. They are 
either connate with the vertex or more or less indistinctly sepa 
rated therefrom. The anterior ocellus appears, therefore, to be 
remote from the anterior margin of the head, and is visible only 
from above. The anterior wings are of rhomboidal form, /'. <?., 
suddenly widening at base, thence nearly parallel, apex not 
regularly rounded ; tip of wing, therefore, close to the anterior 
margin. Genital plate of male without lateral appendages. 

This genus contains a few European species ; in North Amer 
ica it seems to be confined to the Pacific slope. Our species 
may be distinguished as follows :

Described from numerous specimens collected by Mr. A. 
Koebele in Placer county, Cal., on Arctostaphylos pungcns, dur 
ing the months of September and October, and at Marble Val 
ley, Cal., in the middle of July. The specimens from the latter 
locality are a little darker than those from Placer county. It 
occurs also in the mountains of southern Arizona (Hubbard and 
Schwarz).

Besides the variations in the color of head, thorax and wings 
referred to above, a remarkable variety occurs in California 
which may be readily mistaken for a different species and which, 
for this reason, deserves especial mention and a distinct varietal 
name. 

Var. niveipennis, n. var. 

Color of head and thorax just as variable as in the form described above, 
usually pinkish red, or brownish yellow, or brownish red, thorax usually 
a little darker, surface of head and thorax often a little shining, sculpture 
usually less evident. Wings snow-white, the posterior costa sometimes 
margined with red or tesselated with minute red spots, surface having the 
appearance of being covered with fine white powder, which causes the 
venation to be less distinct than in the typical form and the sculpture to 
become obsolete. The sinuation of the costa in anterior basal cell is ab 
sent; abdomen and legs uniformly yellow. Sexual characters as in the 
typical form..

Found by Mr. Koebele in large numbers in company with the 
typical form, and also in Los Angeles county, Cal. Three speci 
mens from the latter locality, collected in May, are without the 
white powder-like substance on the wings and the transverse 
rugce are as plain as in the typical form.

Length 2.6mm. Above yellowish red, sometimes with a tinge of 
brown, genital segment, underside and legs honey-yellow, wings bi- 
colored. Head large, strongly obliquely deflexed, more or less shining, 
finely rugose, posterior edge slightly emarginate, vertex at middle slightly 
shorter than half its width at base, posterior part flat, genje prominent, 
discal impressions deep, subtransverse, smooth at bottom, vertex in front 
of them distinctly convex, causing the frontal lobes to appear to be de 
pressed below the level of the 
vertex and to be separated there 
from ; frontal lobes usually pale 
yellow, a little shorter than in 
the preceding species, antennae 
a little longer than in the pre 
ceding, pale yellow, dusky at tip. 

Surface of thorax subopaque, 
finely and obsoletely alutaceous, 
without distinct markings, mid 
dle of dorsulum and mesono- 
tum usually darker; pronotum

pressions very conspicuous ; dor 
sulum also strongly ascending, larger than in the preceding, front and 
hind margins equally arched; mesonotum at middle slightly convex lon 
gitudinally.

therefore less rhomboidal than in the preceding; surface very little shin 
ing, transversely rugose between the veins, rugae and interstices finely 
rugose, radial cell, the larger portion of discoidal cell, posterior basal cell 
and clavus pale yellow and tolerably transparent, the rest of the wing 
brown and hardly transparent. At the apical portion of the wing the two 
colors are not sharply divided. Cubitus a little longer than discoidal part 
of subcosta, both strongly prominent, straight, radial part of subcosta as 
long as discoidal part and becoming nearly obsolete at apex; no ptero-

2. DESCRIPTION OF THE NEST-CONSTRUCTING PSYLLID. 
{EupJialerus, n. gen. ; nidifex, n. sp.) 

At a previous place in this volume (pp. 1^3-154) a short 
characterization (accompanied by a figure), will be found of the 
peculiar habit of the larva of this Psyllid, and the following lines 
are copied from a description of the perfect insect drawn up by 
myself in 1887 : 

Euphalerus, n. gen. (subfamily Aphalarinae). 

Body glabrous, stouter than in Psyllopsis or Aphalara but much less 
so than in Eupliyllura. Head deflexed vertically or nearly so, vertex 
slightly emarginate posteriorly, not narrowed at the sides, at middle half 
as long as its width at base, anteriorly slightly obliquely truncate each 
side of median line; frontal cones present, triangular, contiguous at base, 
slightly diverging apically, not depressed below the level of the vertex 
and separated therefrom only by a finely impressed line; antennie very 
thin but less slender than in Psyllopsis, slightly clavate at tip. 

Surface of thorax very convex longitudinally; pronotum nearly vertical, 
dorsulum strongly ascending posteriorly, mesonotum longitudinally con 
vex posteriorly. The transverse convexity of the parts of the thorax is 
also greater than in 



OF WASHINGTON. 239 

Wings membranaceous, oblong-oval, subhyaline, shining, smooth, to 
ward the apex with sparse shallow impressed points, gently widening at 
base, then of nearly equal width, regularly rounded at apex, tip between 
radius and fourth furcal close to the latter; veins very prominent, cubitus a 
little shorter than discoidal part of subcosta, n distinct, moderately long 
pterostigma, radius nearly straight throughout; stem of second fork 
curved and not parallel with radius, second furcal much longer than an}' 
of the other f urea Is ; first marginal cell much larger than the second. 
Genital parts of male without appendages or lobes, genital plates of female 
simple. 

Agrees with Psyllopsis in the presence of frontal cones, but 
differs by the much greater deflexion of the head, with the fron 
tal cones not depressed below the level of the vertex, the shorter 
antennae, the greater convexity of the thoracic surface, the vena 
tion and by the sexual characters. 

Euphalerus nidifex, n. sp. 

Length 2 mm. Color pale ochre-yellow vary 
ing to greenish yellow or reddish yellow, head, 
thorax, wings and legs speckled with minute 
black or brown dots, wings slightly whitish. 
Surface opaque, impunctate, vertex of the form 
described above, surface flat, discal impressions 
nearly obsolete, frontal cones nearly as long as 
the vertex, very little diverging, not acute at tip ; FIG. Z. 
antennae not reaching to the posterior margin of 

mesonotum, pale yellow, tips of intermediate joints and terminal ioints 
black, 3djoint one-fourth longer than the 4th, Qth and ioth small and form 
ing a distinct club. 

Dorsulum more than twice wider than long at middle, front and hind 
margins nearly equally rounded; mesonotum barely as long as dorsulum, 
decidedly descending posteriorly, convex transversely. 

Wings gently widening at base, thence remaining of nearly equal width, 
2\ times longer than wide, regularly rounded at apex, slightly whitish, 
transparent, not rugose, but the small black dots are impressed at the outer 
part of the wing; veins strong, pretty regularly tesselated with brown 
dots; stigma moderately long, narrow and not different in coloration; 
radius straight and only at terminus slightly curved anteriorly; stem of 
second fork nearly twice longer than that of the first fork; first furcal as 
long as cubitus, terminating obliquely on the costa, second furcal twice 
longer, nearly straight at basal half, then suddenly curved and terminat 
ing obliquely on the costa, third and fourth furcals of equal length, each 
about one-third longer than the first; first marginal cell quadrangular 
rather than triangular and much larger than second marginal cell ; tip of 
wing close to fourth furcal within discoidal cell.

narrowing apicallv, front margin convex, posterior margin concave, tip 
subtruncate and pointing posteriorly; forceps distinctly lower and much 
narrower than the plate, straight, hardly narrowing apicallv, tip subacute, 
black. 

9- Genital segment about as long as the three preceding ventral seg 
ments together, upper plate higher than the lower plate, gradually nar

Originally found by myself on the Island of Key West, Fla., 
in April, 1887, but subsequently (in 1903) bred in great numbers 
from larval cases found at the same place and at Cayamas, Cuba, 
on the leaves and young shoots of Piscidia erytJirina.

3. THE SUMAC PSYLLID.E OF THE UNITED STATES. 
(GENUS Calophya Fr. Lrew, subfamily Psyllinae.) 

This genus, fotuided upon a single Kuropean species, is easily 
recognizable by the peculiar formation of the head ; the vertex is, 
at its anteriorly half, longitudinally convex, and therefore ante 
riorly inverted : the frontal cones or lobes which are of varying 1 

J j O 

length but always shorter than the vertex, thus appear to be in 
serted on the underside of the head and they form a distinct angle 
with the vertex. Anterior ocellus not or barely visible from 
above. Antennae short and stout, at most as long as the width 
of the head. Wings of varying shape, either smooth or indis 
tinctly sculptured, transparent or opaque; cubitus very short, 
pterostigma present, long but narrow, first marginal cell decid 
edly larger than the second ; genital plate of male more or less 
oval in outline. 

The species are of small, rather stout form and live, so far as 
known, exclusively on various species of Rhus (sumac). Out- 
eastern species hibernate as full-grown larvae or pupae on the 
stems of their food-plants, and there is but one generation each 
year.* 

*The development of the two species occurring near Washington. 
D. C., was carefully studied by Mr. Theo. Pergande many years ago, and 
some fine drawings illustrating the various stages were made by Dr. Marx. 
For some reason unknown to me the box containing most of the type 
specimens of our species of Calopsylla, as well as the drawings and the 
manuscript referring to the descriptions of the earlier stages, could not 
be found after the death of Dr. C. V. Riley. Such of the figures as are 
still in my care are herewith published without further comment.

TABLE OF SPECIES. 

Wings rounded at tip; pterostigma long and very distinct. 

Wings hyaline, shining; vertex and thorax black or brown ; frontal 
cones decidedly longer than wide, coniform, acute at tip, 

calt'Jorntca, n. sp. 

Wings yellowish, transparent, moderately shining; color of body 
uniformly honey-yellow; frontal cones distinctly cone-shaped, 

longer than wide flavida, n. sp.

The color of our species appears to be more constant than in 
most other Psyllids, so that it can safely be relied upon for the 
distinction of the species ; immature specimens of nigripennis 
can readily be distinguished from Jlavida and calif ornica by the 
form of the frontal cones.

upper plate; its lower edge nearly straight, gently ascending. 

I have seen a number of specimens, partly collected by Mr. 

H. K. Morrison in southern Ari 
zona or Sonora, and partly by Mr. 
Coquillett in Los Angeles Co., Cal 
Subsequently many specimens 
were found on Rhus trilobata in 
the mountains of southern Arizona 
by Mr. H. G. Hubbard and myself

Immature specimens resemble C.Jiavida but may be distin 
guished by the shorter vertex, shorter frontal cones, the sexual 
characters of the male and by slight differences in the venation.
